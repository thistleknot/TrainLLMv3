    "Context:\n\nThe United States has 63 national parks, which are congressionally designated protected areas operated by the National Park Service, an agency of the Department of the Interior. National parks are designated for their natural beauty, unique geological features, diverse ecosystems, and recreational opportunities, typically \"because of some outstanding scenic feature or natural phenomena.\" While legislatively all units of the National Park System are considered equal with the same mission, national parks are generally larger and more of a destination, and hunting and extractive activities are prohibited. National monuments, on the other hand, are also frequently protected for their historical or archaeological significance. Eight national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below. The 424 units of the National Park System can be broadly referred to as national parks, but most have other formal designations.\n\nThirty states have national parks, as do the territories of American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The state with the most national parks is California with nine, followed by Alaska with eight, Utah with five, and Colorado with four. The largest national park is Wrangell\u2013St. Elias in Alaska: at over 8 million acres (32,375 km2), it is larger than each of the nine smallest states. The next three largest parks are also in Alaska. The smallest park is Gateway Arch National Park, Missouri, at 91 acres (0.37 km2). The total area protected by national parks is approximately 52.2 million acres (211,000 km2), for an average of 829 thousand acres (3,350 km2) but a median of only 208 thousand acres (840 km2).\n\nThe national parks set a visitation record in 2017, with more than 84 million visitors and set a further record in 2018 with a 0.1% increase. Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee has been the most-visited park since 1944, and had over 14 million visitors in 2021. In contrast, only about 7,000 people visited the remote Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve in Alaska in 2021.\n\nAnswer:\n\nIf we use number of visitors as a proxy for popularity then The Great Smoky Mountains National Park with over 14 million visitors in 2021 would rank as the most popular National Park. The least visited National Park is the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. Its lower visitation rate may have more to do with its remoteness than the Park's popularity.\n\nInstruction:\n\nBased on the paragraph below, which are the most and least popular National Parks in the US?\n\n",

    "Instruction:\n\nHow was art used for manipulative purpose in racial discuss in the 20th century?Context:\n\nRacial categories have historically been used as a way to enable an oppressive figure or group to discriminate against other groups or individuals which were seen as different from that of the oppressor. In nineteenth and early twentieth century Europe, artwork was a common form of racialization which targeted countries in the Middle East and Asia. The artwork, predominantly paintings, were portrayed in order to instill prejudice in the Western populations through sexualizing and manipulating images. One of the most prominent examples of Orientalist work in art is a piece by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix titled Women of Algiers in their Apartment. Dating back to 1834, it portrays three women resting in a harem in exotic clothing while an African woman is dressed in plain clothing, depicting her role as a servant. Fine textiles, hookahs, and other paraphernalia adorn the room, which represents a European fantasy of an exotic scene. Attempts to portray these cultures as strange, foreign and exotic through Orientalism led to intolerance towards the Arab and Asian communities in Europe and the United States. Others argue that Delacroix, who travelled in North Africa sketching extensively, was depicting a realistic scene of the era based on his first-hand knowledge and experience. In such an interpretation the clothing, for example, is consistent with the times, as Arab North Africans dressed differently from Europeans, and kept black slaves who would not have been treated as equals.\n\nAnswer:\n\nIn the 19th to 20th century, Europeans commonly use artworks to portray prejudice towards Middle Eastern and Asian people.\n\n",

    "Context:\n\nMultiomics, multi-omics, integrative omics, \"panomics\" or \"pan-omics\" is a biological analysis approach in which the data sets are multiple \"omes\", such as the genome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome, metabolome, and microbiome (i.e., a meta-genome and/or meta-transcriptome, depending upon how it is sequenced); in other words, the use of multiple omics technologies to study life in a concerted way. By combining these \"omes\", scientists can analyze complex biological big data to find novel associations between biological entities, pinpoint relevant biomarkers and build elaborate markers of disease and physiology. In doing so, multiomics integrates diverse omics data to find a coherently matching geno-pheno-envirotype relationship or association. The OmicTools service lists more than 99 softwares related to multiomic data analysis, as well as more than 99 databases on the topic.\n\nSystems biology approaches are often based upon the use of panomic analysis data. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) defines panomics as referring to \"the interaction of all biological functions within a cell and with other body functions, combining data collected by targeted tests ... and global assays (such as genome sequencing) with other patient-specific information.\"\n\nSingle-cell multiomics\nA branch of the field of multiomics is the analysis of multilevel single-cell data, called single-cell multiomics. This approach gives us an unprecedent resolution to look at multilevel transitions in health and disease at the single cell level. An advantage in relation to bulk analysis is to mitigate confounding factors derived from cell to cell variation, allowing the uncovering of heterogeneous tissue architectures.\n\nMethods for parallel single-cell genomic and transcriptomic analysis can be based on simultaneous amplification or physical separation of RNA and genomic DNA. They allow insights that cannot be gathered solely from transcriptomic analysis, as RNA data do not contain non-coding genomic regions and information regarding copy-number variation, for example. An extension of this methodology is the integration of single-cell transcriptomes to single-cell methylomes, combining single-cell bisulfite sequencing to single cell RNA-Seq. Other techniques to query the epigenome, as single-cell ATAC-Seq and single-cell Hi-C also exist.\n\nA different, but related, challenge is the integration of proteomic and transcriptomic data. One approach to perform such measurement is to physically separate single-cell lysates in two, processing half for RNA, and half for proteins. The protein content of lysates can be measured by proximity extension assays (PEA), for example, which use DNA-barcoded antibodies. A different approach uses a combination of heavy-metal RNA probes and protein antibodies to adapt mass cytometry for multiomic analysis.\n\nMultiomics and machine learning\nIn parallel to the advances in highthroughput biology, machine learning applications to biomedical data analysis are flourishing. The integration of multi-omics data analysis and machine learning has led to the discovery of new biomarkers. For example, one of the methods of the mixOmics project implements a method based on sparse Partial Least Squares regression for selection of features (putative biomarkers).\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiomics\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) defines panomics as referring to \"the interaction of all biological functions within a cell and with other body functions, combining data collected by targeted tests ... and global assays (such as genome sequencing) with other patient-specific information.\"\n\nInstruction:\n\nGiven these paragraphs about Multiomics, what is panomics?\n\n",

I've finished school this past year and started devoting more time to meeting new people and trying to be more sociable. I met someone (30/M), and found that we have a lot in common, we have similar interests and hobbies.. I liked his confidence and his sense of humor and we just \"clicked\". Around the time we met, I had to move temporarily but we kept in touch, mostly through texting (he never calls and because of that I just feel awkward calling him). So here is where things get confusing :\n\nI know that we are just getting to know each other, and that at this point there is no commitment. So, I know that it's okay if we see other people at this stage, and it doesn't bother me if he does. He recently and suddenly took a trip to a foreign country, and I had a hunch that he was going there to meet someone. He sent me pictures of his dinner and there was another plate of food on the other side of the table. I asked him if he was eating alone and he said yes. Since he took this trip (1 week ago) he would only text me early in the morning, and wouldn't reply to my texts during the day. I asked him if he met someone there and he denied, I suggested that he should meet someone to show him around town and he said that he doesn't want to.  \n\nIt doesn't bother me that he's there to meet someone or that he's seeing other people. What bothers me is that he is lying about it, I feel like he's patronizing me by lying when its so obvious (he's not going to be alone in another country for a week). Am I wrong in expecting brutal honesty from him? Is seeing other people at the beginning of the relationship some unspoken rule that we shouldn't be talking about or admitting to? and should I just give up on him?\n\nPrompt:\n\nTL;DR\n\nResponse:\n\nNew to dating, Met someone who is now seeing other people and lying about it. The lying part bothers me. is this normal?\n\n",

He was thrown out of his home at 14 when his mother and abusive boyfriend accused him of stealing her pot and was homeless for two years. He tried just about every drug under the sun because of his experiences on the streets, but now sticks solely to pot and cigarettes. As you can probably imagine, he's seen the inside of a jail cell many times (but all while he was a minor and all related to drug possession only). He's been stabbed, beaten, burnt, and shot due to his attempts to help his far more criminal and far more dangerous twin brother. At 18 he finally managed to pull his life together, only to find out at 24 his girlfriend of  8 years was cheating on him and ever since he caught her she has routinely beaten the crap out of him any time he tries to leave her. He never calls the cops because she threatens to accuse him of rape and he never fights back because he adamantly believes guys do not hit girls. \n\nHowever, the icing on the cake here is that he has an inoperable brain tumor (caused by head trauma caused by his abusive father) that he discovered three years ago and has done nothing to try and treat. He has no insurance and his family couldn't care less what happens to him. The tumor causes him seizures and has prevented him from being able to drive and therefore hold a job. He notices that as every year passes he loses a little more function and is in a little more pain. He was told when first diagnosed that he'd be lucky to see 30 and has resigned himself to this fact. More and more I am afraid he will kill himself to end his severe headaches and misery over feeling unloved and unwanted...\n\nReddit, what do I do? I have very little money myself and I am currently banned from even talking to him thanks to my family's fear over him being a bad influence. He may not be perfect, but he sure as hell does not deserve to die. What can I do for him?\n\nPrompt:\n\nTL;DR\n\nResponse:\n\nI have a friend who has been through hell and who may be dying of a brain tumor and lacks the insurance needed to get help.

Things have been going really well. He's smart, kind, funny, all the things I look for in a partner. He told me when we started dating that he was 20.

He was one of the few German poets of his era that Frederick the Great enjoyed.\n\nBiography\nCanitz was born in Berlin, Brandenburg. He was influenced by Boileau.  He attended the universities of Leiden and Leipzig, travelled in England, France, Italy and the Netherlands, and on his return was appointed groom of the bedchamber (Kammerjunker) to Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, whom he accompanied on his campaigns in Pomerania and Sweden.\n\nIn 1680 Canitz became councillor of legation, and he was employed on various embassies. In 1697 Elector Frederick III made him a privy councillor, and Emperor Leopold I created him a baron of the Empire. Having fallen ill on an embassy to the Hague, he obtained his discharge and died at Berlin in 1699.\n\nHe wrote verse in a restrained, sober style.

    "Context:\n\nMagnetism is the class of physical attributes that are mediated by a magnetic field, which refers to the capacity to induce attractive and repulsive phenomena in other entities. Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles giving rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. Magnetism is one aspect of the combined phenomena of electromagnetism. The most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, producing magnetic fields themselves. Demagnetizing a magnet is also possible. Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are iron, cobalt, and nickel and their alloys. The rare-earth metals neodymium and samarium are less common examples. The prefix ferro- refers to iron because permanent magnetism was first observed in lodestone, a form of natural iron ore called magnetite, Fe3O4.\n\nAll substances exhibit some type of magnetism. Magnetic materials are classified according to their bulk susceptibility. Ferromagnetism is responsible for most of the effects of magnetism encountered in everyday life, but there are actually several types of magnetism. Paramagnetic substances, such as aluminium and oxygen, are weakly attracted to an applied magnetic field; diamagnetic substances, such as copper and carbon, are weakly repelled; while antiferromagnetic materials, such as chromium and spin glasses, have a more complex relationship with a magnetic field. The force of a magnet on paramagnetic, diamagnetic, and antiferromagnetic materials is usually too weak to be felt and can be detected only by laboratory instruments, so in everyday life, these substances are often described as non-magnetic.\n\nInstruction:\n\nGiven a reference text about magnetism, tell me the definition of magnetism and how magnetic materials are classified.Answer:\n\nMagnetism is defined as the physical attributes that are mediated by a magnetic field, which is the capacity to induce attractive and repulsive forces.

    "Context:\n\nThe Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. It formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority (99.86%) of the system's mass is in the Sun, with most of the remaining mass contained in the planet Jupiter. The planetary system around the Sun contains eight planets. The four inner system planets\u2014Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars\u2014are terrestrial planets, being composed primarily of rock and metal. The four giant planets of the outer system are substantially larger and more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the next two, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of volatile substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, such as water, ammonia, and methane. All eight planets have nearly circular orbits that lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System\n\nInstruction:\n\nBased on this paragraph, which two objects account for the majority of the mass of the Solar System?Answer:\n\nBased on this paragraph, the Sun and Jupiter are the two objects that account for the majority of the mass of the Solar System, with the Sun responsible for 99.86% of the total.\n\n",

    "Context:\n\nThe history of Bangkok dates at least back to the early 15th century, to when it was a village on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River, under the rule of Ayutthaya. Because of its strategic location near the mouth of the river, the town gradually increased in importance.

This is a big red flag for me in thinking about a long term relationship or possibly marriage, and has me considering whether I should even continue the relationship or cut ties while it's still early on. That said, I do like the guy very much and would rather work on it than just cut and run.\n\nMy boyfriend has said on multiple occasions that he is \"shy\" when it comes to sex. He also has said that if anyone can break him out of it, he thinks it would be me. That gives me hope that he wants to explore, but I've asked him many times both during sex and in conversation for something as simple as switching up positions (doggy specifically), and his response is always, \"but I like to look at you\", and then I feel like a dick because hey, he's being sweet. But sweet is now boring to me. \n\nSo my question is, how do I get my boyfriend to move away from the shy end of the spectrum into the fun, creative, exciting side? I'm super open and want to try a lot of things, but I can't figure out how to help him loosen up. I've sent him random dirty photos in the middle of the day, been direct in asking him questions about what he likes, etc. and while he's responsive to those things, he drops the ball and doesn't take it to the next level afterwards. I feel totally out of my element as the woman dealing with a more submissive/quiet guy, and could definitely use some outside advice/perspective. Thanks!\n\nPrompt:\n\nTL;DR\n\nResponse:\n\nMy otherwise great boyfriend is shy about sex (talking about it, or doing anything other than missionary).

Myself (29/m) and my GF (25/f) have been together for about 4 years. Over that time our sex life has dwindled to about once a month (average). There are many reasons for this, including some pain during sex for her which resulted in a minor operation. Additionally we moved states which involved getting new jobs which has been harder for her. We're tired a lot and often prefer to sleep rather than do the horizontal shuffle. Importantly, she does respond if I'm 'pushy' about it, but that's not really me - so I think my lack of initiation is another root cause of the issue.\n\nThe rest of our relationship is just fine, we love each other a lot, talk about marriage a lot, and it feels like we're soulmates. We just don't do it that much.\n\nHere's the thing: when I was younger, this would've bothered me a lot. I once had a relationship where we didn't do it for 8 months straight, and that hurt a lot mentally. In this one, though, it feels different. I almost feel like it doesn't matter that we don't do it that much, like it's just who we are and that's fine. Another part of me says 'hey, you should care, it's what normal people do'. I also know that she takes her head apart over this and blames herself for the low sex (I do not blame her) which puts pressure on her and makes her less encouraged to do it! \n\nFor my part, I often don't feel up for sex anyway, so I don't think I've got a high libido either. I've never thought sex was the be-all-and-end-all, and it's not a priority in my life. The only time I feel it is is when I compare myself to 'normal' and feel like I SHOULD care about sex like everyone else does.\n\nI guess I'm asking; how do I explain to her that there's no pressure from me on this?\n\nAll advice appreciated. Thanks!\n\nPrompt:\n\nTL;DR\n\nResponse:\n\nGirlfriend of 4 years blames herself for low-sex relationship when it doesn't actually bother me that much.

    "Instruction:\n\nWhat kind of guitar pick did Stevie Ray Vaughan prefer?Context:\n\nVaughan bought many Stratocasters and gave some away as gifts. A sunburst Diplomat Strat-style guitar was purchased by Vaughan and given to his girlfriend Janna Lapidus to learn to play on. Vaughan used a custom set of uncommonly heavy strings, gauges .013, .015, .019, .028, .038, .058, and tuned a half-step below standard tuning. With these heavy string sizes, it was not uncommon for him to separate his fingernail because of his quick movement along the strings. The owner of an Austin club recalled Vaughan coming into the office between sets to borrow super glue, which he used to keep a fingernail split from widening while he continued to play. The super glue was suggested by Rene Martinez, who was Stevie's guitar technician. Martinez eventually convinced Stevie to change to slightly lighter strings. He preferred a guitar neck with an asymmetrical profile (thicker at the top), which was more comfortable for his thumb-over style of playing. Heavy use of the vibrato bar necessitated frequent replacements; Vaughan often had his roadie, Byron Barr, obtain custom stainless steel bars made by Barr's father. As for his usage of plectrums, Vaughan preferred Fender medium gauge guitar picks, using one of the rounder shoulders of the pick rather than the pointed tip to pluck and strum the strings.\n\nAnswer:\n\nSRV is known to have used Fender's medium gauge picks, but with an interesting quirk - he preferred the rounder edge over the pointy tip, which most players use.\n\n",
    "Context:\n\nMost modern surfboards are made of fiberglass foam (PU), with one or more wooden strips or \"stringers\", fiberglass cloth, and polyester resin (PE). An emerging board material is epoxy resin and Expanded Polystyrene foam (EPS) which is stronger and lighter than traditional PU/PE construction. Even newer designs incorporate materials such as carbon fiber and variable-flex composites in conjunction with fiberglass and epoxy or polyester resins. Since epoxy/EPS surfboards are generally lighter, they will float better than a traditional PU/PE board of similar size, shape and thickness. This makes them easier to paddle and faster in the water. However, a common complaint of EPS boards is that they do not provide as much feedback as a traditional PU/PE board.

My wife took a new job towards the beginning of the year and it's very stressful, much more so than my own, she also moved in with me at the same time and she had never lived with someone before.  My wife also has diagnosed OCD (she just worries about everything, no counting or anything like that) and stress makes OCD way worse.  After taking the job, she upped her med dosage and the crazy/awesome sex life we had ceased to exist.  She went to the doctor who told her she has a low libido and they were discussing options (none of which were very good) when she got pregnant.  She is off meds now and won't take any due to small risk to the baby.  Whenever I bring up sex now it turns into a huge fight, she asks me to please just give it a rest until the baby is born and we can get back to normal after that.  She doesn't mind me asking for sex so much as when I tell her that the way things are going is wrong and she should care more about my needs.  She basically told me I don't understand what she is going through and her needs are much more important than mine right now.  We haven't been married that long so I'm just disappointed the pregnancy took away our honeymoon period and that we're not establishing good boundaries and fulfilling each other's needs right now.  Am I being a dick?  Do I need to just chill out about sex and support her more emotionally?  Help me Reddit!\n\nPrompt:\n\nTL;DR\n\nResponse:\n\nwife suffers badly from stress, is off meds because of pregnancy and not interested in sex, should I lay off about it?\n\n",

    "Context:\n\nApple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977. The company's second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement. By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.\n\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as \"Wintel\"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the \"Think different\" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\n\nInstruction:\n\nGiven a reference text about Apple, what tactics did Steve Jobs use to help the company recover?Answer:\n\nSteve Jobs launched multiple products such as the iPod and iPhone, opened the Apple Store retail chain, and performed numerous acquisitions to bring Apple back to profitability.\n\n",

The club joined the NFL in 1976 as an expansion team, along with the Seattle Seahawks, and played its first season in the American Football Conference (AFC) West division. Prior to the 1977 season, Tampa Bay switched conferences and divisions with Seattle, becoming a member of the NFC Central division.

    "Context:\n\nIn marketing, customer lifetime value (CLV or often CLTV), lifetime customer value (LCV), or life-time value (LTV) is a prognostication of the net profit contributed to the whole future relationship with a customer. The prediction model can have varying levels of sophistication and accuracy, ranging from a crude heuristic to the use of complex predictive analytics techniques.\n\nCustomer lifetime value can also be defined as the monetary value of a customer relationship, based on the present value of the projected future cash flows from the customer relationship. Customer lifetime value is an important concept in that it encourages firms to shift their focus from quarterly profits to the long-term health of their customer relationships. Customer lifetime value is an important metric because it represents an upper limit on spending to acquire new customers. For this reason it is an important element in calculating payback of advertising spent in marketing mix modeling.\n\nOne of the first accounts of the term customer lifetime value is in the 1988 book Database Marketing, which includes detailed worked examples. Early adopters of customer lifetime value models in the 1990s include Edge Consulting and BrandScience.\n\nAnswer:\n\nCustomer lifetime value is commonly referred to as customer lifetime value (CLV or often CLTV), lifetime customer value (LCV), or life-time value (LTV).\n\nInstruction:\n\nWhat are all the different ways of saying customer lifetime value?\n\n",

New subscriber, and thought it only appropriate to contibute one of my own petty revenge stories.  \n\nAfter losing my job, I was having trouble finding employment. So when I found a job selling Kirby vaccuums, I kinda ignored the warning signs. My job ended up being a road guy. People would respond to flyers and ask for a free demonstration. I would drive to their house, do a demonstration of the vaccuum, then hand things over to the sales person that would arrive later.  \n\nWell after a week, I had only done around 5-6 demonstrations. I was constantly sent to homes 45 minutes to an hour away, and more often than not, there was no answer to my knocks. Combined with the fact that they weren't reimbursing me with gas money, I was starting to get pissed and my bank account was being funneled into my gas tank. Then finally, I get a demonstration for a woman who seems genuinely interested. So I do my best demonstration yet, and then hand things off to the salesperson. Now the demonstraters make money based on how much the salesperson sells the unit for. Starting price for the unit was $2300. if the unit sold for less than $1500, demonstrater doesn't get anything. So you could understand my rage when after a week of failed demos and driving all over town, the salesperson drops the price to $1500 as soon as the woman says \"$2300 seems a bit high...\"\n\nAt this point I'm pissed. Then my chance comes. They allow us to take a few units home for the weekend to demo for our families and such. So that weekend, I get friends and family to pay me to shampoo their homes (in all honestly, the machines ARE great, just extremely overpriced), and then on Monday morning, about 3 hours before the office opens, I pack up all the Kirbys in their boxes without cleaning a single one. Carpet strings and hair in the brushes, dirty soapy water in the resevior, dried shampoo all over the front of the machine, etc, drop them off in front of the office, and leave.

    "Context:\n\nTamil is one of the longest-surviving classical languages of India. A. K. Ramanujan described it as \"the only language of contemporary India which is recognizably continuous with a classical past\". The variety and quality of classical Tamil literature has led to it being described as \"one of the great classical traditions and literatures of the world\". Recorded Tamil literature has been documented for over 2000 years. The earliest period of Tamil literature, Sangam literature, is dated from c. 300 BC until AD 300. It has the oldest extant literature among Dravidian languages. The earliest epigraphic records found on rock edicts and 'hero stones' date from around the 3rd century BC. About 60,000 of the approximately 100,000 inscriptions found by the Archaeological Survey of India in India are in Tamil Nadu. Of them, most are in Tamil, with only about 5 percent in other languages. Tamil language inscriptions written in Brahmi script have been discovered in Sri Lanka and on trade goods in Thailand and Egypt. The two earliest manuscripts from India, acknowledged and registered by the UNESCO Memory of the World register in 1997 and 2005, were written in Tamil.\n\nAnswer:\n\nTamil language is one of the oldest and longest surviving classical language and is existing from 300 BC.

    "Context:\n\nFriedrich Rudolf Ludwig Freiherr von Canitz (27 November 1654 \u2013 11 August 1699) was a German poet and diplomat. He was one of the few German poets of his era that Frederick the Great enjoyed.\n\nBiography\nCanitz was born in Berlin, Brandenburg. He was influenced by Boileau.  He attended the universities of Leiden and Leipzig, travelled in England, France, Italy and the Netherlands, and on his return was appointed groom of the bedchamber (Kammerjunker) to Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, whom he accompanied on his campaigns in Pomerania and Sweden.\n\nIn 1680 Canitz became councillor of legation, and he was employed on various embassies. In 1697 Elector Frederick III made him a privy councillor, and Emperor Leopold I created him a baron of the Empire. Having fallen ill on an embassy to the Hague, he obtained his discharge and died at Berlin in 1699.\n\nHe wrote verse in a restrained, sober style.  He was considered as one of the poets who \u201cproduced verse that was specifically aimed at entertaining and flattering princes and high courtiers.\u201d Although he liked making verse in many languages, he never published any of them. Canitz's poems (Nebenstunden unterschiedener Gedichte), which did not appear until after his death (1700), are for the most part dry and stilted imitations of French and Latin models, but they formed a healthy contrast to the coarseness and bombast of the later Silesian poets.\n\nA complete edition of Canitz's poems was published by U. K\u00f6nig in 1727; see also L. Fulda, Die Gegner der zweiten schlesischen Schule, ii. (1883).\n\nInstruction:\n\nGiven a reference text about Friedrich Rudolf Ludwig Freiherr von Canitz, when and where was he born?Answer:\n\nFriedrich Rudolf Ludwig Freiherr von Canitz was born in Berlin on November 27, 1654.\n\n",
    "Instruction:\n\nGiven this text about speakers of varieties of Louisiana French, has the number of French speakers in Texas increased or decreased since the middle of the twentieth century?Context:\n\nReliable counts of speakers of Louisiana French are difficult to obtain as distinct from other varieties of French. However, the vast majority of native residents of Louisiana and east and southeast Texas who speak French are likely speakers of Louisiana French.\n\nIn Louisiana, as of 2010, the population of French speakers was approximately 115,183. These populations were concentrated most heavily in the southern, coastal parishes.\n\nIn Texas, as of 2010, the French-speaking population was 55,773, though many of these were likely immigrants from France and other locations, living in the urban areas. Nevertheless, in the rural eastern/southeastern Texas counties of Orange, Jefferson, Chambers, Newton, Jasper, Tyler, Liberty, and Hardin alone\u2014areas where it can be reasonably presumed that almost all French speakers are Louisiana French speakers\u2014the total French-speaking population was composed of 3,400 individuals. It is likely a substantial portion of the 14,493 speakers in Houston's Harris county are also Louisiana French speakers. With this in mind, a marked decline in the number of French speakers in Texas has been noticed in the last half of the twentieth century. For example, at one point[when?] the French-speaking population of Jefferson County was 24,049 as compared to the mere 1,922 today. Likewise, in Harris County the French-speaking population has shifted from 26,796 to 14,493 individuals.\n\nLouisiana French-speaking populations can also be found in southern Mississippi and Alabama, as well as pockets in other parts of the United States.\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt has generally decreased.  For example, in the second half of the twentieth century, the French-speaking population of Jefferson County was 24,049 as compared to 1,922 today. Similarly, in Harris County the French-speaking population has shifted from 26,796 to 14,493.\n\n",

    "Context:\n\nAntestor (Norwegian: [\u02c8\u0251\u0300nt\u0259stu\u02d0\u027d]) is a Norwegian Christian extreme metal band formed in 1990 in Jessheim. Credited for starting the northern European Christian black metal scene, Antestor is the only Christian band to have an album released by Cacophonous Records, which has also released records by bands such as Dimmu Borgir, Sigh, and Cradle of Filth. The band's only release on Cacophonous, The Return of the Black Death, proved influential for the Christian black metal movement, and has sold over 10,000 copies.\n\nIn the late 1990s they dubbed their musical style as \"sorrow metal\" rather than black metal because the black metal movement was publicly affiliated with Satanism in Norway. According to HM magazine, the progressive elements on the debut album, Martyrium, were possibly ahead of their time in the Norwegian extreme metal scene.\n\nThe group has gone through several line-up changes over the years, and currently Antestor consists of the founding guitarist Lars Stokstad (Vemod), vocalist Ronny Hansen (Vrede), bassist Erik Normann Aanonsen, guitarist Robert Bordevick, and drummer Henning B\u00f8rven. The original vocalist Kjetil Molnes (Martyr) and drummer Svein Sander (Armoth) left the band around 2000, and the members of a fellow Norwegian black metal group, Vaakevandring, joined Antestor. The reputable Norwegian extreme metal drummer Jan Axel Blomberg (Hellhammer) played session drums for their 2005 album The Forsaken and Det tapte liv EP. A fourth studio album, Omen, was released in 2012.\n\nInstruction:\n\nWhy was Antestor known as sorrow metal?Answer:\n\nBecause black metal was associated with Satanism in Antestor's home country Norway, and they are a Christian extreme metal band.\n\n",

    "Context:\n\nEnglish congregationalist preacher Rev. William Davis found some success evangelizing the miners and their families after establishing a church in Guston in 1892, the only one in the Red Mountain Mining District. The church had not only a bell but also a steam whistle to announce when services were commencing. Davis had earlier tried unsuccessfully to establish a church in Red Mountain Town. The day after the Guston church opened, the commercial district of Red Mountain Town was destroyed in a fire, with some local residents suggesting it was the result of \"divine intervention\".

    "Context:\n\nThe San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge, known locally as the Bay Bridge, is a complex of bridges spanning San Francisco Bay in California. As part of Interstate 80 and the direct road between San Francisco and Oakland, it carries about 260,000 vehicles a day on its two decks. It has one of the longest spans in the United States.\n\nThe toll bridge was conceived as early as the California Gold Rush days, with \"Emperor\" Joshua Norton famously advocating for it, but construction did not begin until 1933. Designed by Charles H. Purcell, and built by American Bridge Company, it opened on Thursday, November 12, 1936, six months before the Golden Gate Bridge. It originally carried automobile traffic on its upper deck, with trucks, cars, buses and commuter trains on the lower, but after the Key System abandoned rail service on April 20, 1958, the lower deck was converted to all-road traffic as well. On October 12, 1963, traffic was reconfigured to one way traffic on each deck, westbound on the upper deck, and eastbound on the lower deck, with trucks and buses allowed on the upper deck.\n\nIn 1986, the bridge was unofficially dedicated to former California Governor James Rolph.\n\nThe bridge has two sections of roughly equal length; the older western section, officially known as the Willie L. Brown Jr. Bridge (after former San Francisco Mayor and California State Assembly Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr.), connects downtown San Francisco to Yerba Buena Island, and the newer unnamed eastern section connects the island to Oakland. The western section is a double suspension bridge with two decks, westbound traffic being carried on the upper deck while eastbound is carried on the lower one. The largest span of the original eastern section was a cantilever bridge.\n\nDuring the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, a portion of the eastern section's upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck and the bridge was closed for a month. Reconstruction of the eastern section of the bridge as a causeway connected to a self-anchored suspension bridge began in 2002; the new eastern section opened September 2, 2013, at a reported cost of over $6.5 billion; the original estimate of $250 million was for a seismic retrofit of the existing span. Unlike the western section and the original eastern section of the bridge, the new eastern section is a single deck carrying all eastbound and westbound lanes. Demolition of the old east span was completed on September 8, 2018.\n\nInstruction:\n\nBased on the reference text, why was the eastern section of the bridge rebuilt?Answer:\n\nThe eastern section of the bridge was rebuilt because a portion of its upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.\n\n",

The Buccaneers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) South division. The club joined the NFL in 1976 as an expansion team, along with the Seattle Seahawks, and played its first season in the American Football Conference (AFC) West division. Prior to the 1977 season, Tampa Bay switched conferences and divisions with Seattle, becoming a member of the NFC Central division. As a result of the league's realignment prior to the 2002 season, the Buccaneers joined three former NFC West teams to form the NFC South. The club is owned by the Glazer family and plays its home games at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa.\n\nThe Buccaneers have won two Super Bowl championships and, along with the Baltimore Ravens, are the only two NFL franchises who are undefeated in multiple Super Bowl appearances. They were regarded as a perennial losing franchise for most of their first two decades due to suffering 26 consecutive losses in their first two seasons (including a winless inaugural season) and 14 consecutive losing seasons from 1983 to 1996. Despite these early struggles, Tampa Bay is the first post-merger expansion team to clinch a division title, win a playoff game, and host a conference championship; feats they accomplished by their fourth season in 1979. The team's image improved by the time of their first championship in 2002, also the first for a franchise built after the merger, but they would not win another playoff game until their second Super Bowl championship season in 2020. Concurrent to the lack of success outside of their Super Bowl wins, the Buccaneers hold the NFL's lowest winning percentage at .404.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe Buccaneers have won two Super Bowl championships.\n\n",

It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977. The company's second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement. By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.\n\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as \"Wintel\"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the \"Think different\" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\n\nAnswer:\n\nSteve Jobs launched multiple products such as the iPod and iPhone, opened the Apple Store retail chain, and performed numerous acquisitions to bring Apple back to profitability.\n\n",

I'm moving out of my current place right now\u2014I have two roommates whom I've lived with for years and I'm ready for a change. My girlfriend and I live in the same town, and she wants to live with me for the summer (as her family is in a different town but wants to stay here), before beginning an internship in the town where we both currently live. The plan is for her to live with me for three months  before getting an apartment with two of her best friends in september\u2014this is the last time she'll get to live with them before they leave, so we figured that this would be a good arrangement where everyone involved is satisfied. Plus this functions as a \"trial\" period of living together which I think is smart.\n\nAnyways, if she's looking to live with me for three months, how does the lease work? When I'm apartment hunting, do I need to be up-front with the landlord about her staying temporarily? We'd be splitting rent until she moves off somewhere else, and then it'd be solely my place. Does she even need to be on the lease? I don't want the landlord to jack up my rent if she'll be there for only three months. If she ended up staying longer, of course she'd sign the lease. I was considering not saying anything in the meantime.

    "Instruction:\n\nGiven a reference text about magnetism, tell me the definition of magnetism and how magnetic materials are classified.Context:\n\nMagnetism is the class of physical attributes that are mediated by a magnetic field, which refers to the capacity to induce attractive and repulsive phenomena in other entities. Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles giving rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. Magnetism is one aspect of the combined phenomena of electromagnetism. The most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, producing magnetic fields themselves. Demagnetizing a magnet is also possible. Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are iron, cobalt, and nickel and their alloys. The rare-earth metals neodymium and samarium are less common examples. The prefix ferro- refers to iron because permanent magnetism was first observed in lodestone, a form of natural iron ore called magnetite, Fe3O4.\n\nAll substances exhibit some type of magnetism. Magnetic materials are classified according to their bulk susceptibility. Ferromagnetism is responsible for most of the effects of magnetism encountered in everyday life, but there are actually several types of magnetism. Paramagnetic substances, such as aluminium and oxygen, are weakly attracted to an applied magnetic field; diamagnetic substances, such as copper and carbon, are weakly repelled; while antiferromagnetic materials, such as chromium and spin glasses, have a more complex relationship with a magnetic field. The force of a magnet on paramagnetic, diamagnetic, and antiferromagnetic materials is usually too weak to be felt and can be detected only by laboratory instruments, so in everyday life, these substances are often described as non-magnetic.\n\nAnswer:\n\nMagnetism is defined as the physical attributes that are mediated by a magnetic field, which is the capacity to induce attractive and repulsive forces. Magnetic materials are classified by their bulk susceptibility.\n\n",

I currently hold a full time job, but because of school I was working reduced hours and therefore had a lower pay check. \n\nMy father and I have been having a long drawn-out battle over room and board. We finally agreed to a price of $75 a week, but there's now a catch. He's demanding that I pay every Friday the amount and refuses to do bi-weekly schedule, but that's just semantics.\n\nMy issue is, is that he wants cash. Now, to point the obvious out, cash is not traceable, and he will not take a cheque.\n\nIn the past I bought a car, but had to put it under his name because he had me convinced that my credit score was not strong enough for it to be a loan under just my name. Now, when i agreed to this he forced me to pay the entire year including insurance in one summer, which i did, but it killed any savings I had, and every time we got in a fight, he pulled my keys, even though it was technically my car.\n\nSo I guess the advice I'm seeking is, is how do I basically cover my ass for these rent payments when things go inevitably sour? He has threatened to kick me out in the past, and I want to be able to trace the payments if I ever need to. If I call my bank to put a note on my account saying that as of May 13, 2016, the withdrawals of $150 every pay day are for rent, will that hold any grounds?\n\nThanks for any advice!!\n\nPrompt:\n\nTL;DR\n\nResponse:\n\nDad's a jerk and has screwed me before, how do I prove my money is paying rent with no cheques?\n\n",

The only real reason I have is that I don't love her.\n\nI used to be crazy about her, and I want that feeling again of being totally in love with someone, but I dont think its going to happen with her (we've tried couples therapy, reading books etc.). \n\nI know its not supposed to be sparks for the rest of our lives, but I did think its supposed to be enjoyable, our relationship and sex life have fizzled over time. \n\nI don't really find her interesting, she doesn't really have goals or feel driven to achieve anything amazing (I am driven and entrepreneurial, want to start my own business soon etc.). When we first got together she wanted to be a wife and mother, and I thought great that lines up with what I want.\n\nWith those ticked off, I kind of figured she'd have something after that, but not really.

She gets very angry if I mention this.\n\nShe berates me for going to work events, social events, networking etc. which sucks because I love the buzz around that sort of thing.\n\nWe are civil towards each other, and can stick it out for the kids.

She's always been there for me, and supported me in a lot of ways, I feel so guilty for wanting to leave. I mentioned a trial separation once and she was furious and said that either its over or we're together.\n\n[Also as an FYI: Part of the catalyst for me wanting to leave, is that I met a coworker about 18 months ago, and we have chemistry.

He went to law school and they gave it to him as a 'reward' for all his effort. \n\nWell, I graduated in computer science last year, I lived with them for the last year while I finished school. My father told me in advance the economy hit them hard (bullshit, it recovered) so they can't give me the same things that they gave my brother and that providing me free shelter that year and paying for my degree would be considered my gift. Well, they hand me down their 1999 jeep and told me I have to move out as soon as I get a job. \n\nI haven't brought up how pissed I am, I know that they didn't approve of me not studying to be a lawyer or doctor, but at least they could tell me that's why they did this. While they did pay both our student loans off, my brother went to a *way* more expensive school than me and lived there for all four years in the dorm. When I jokingly told him that our parents didn't really get me anything, he got really defensive and said that gas and insurance on his car, and upkeep of his home require a huge income and that he'll be able to afford it, and that if my parents gave me the same, I wouldn't be able to afford it. He said if I got into a stable relationship or a marriage, they would probably help me. Yeah right. Her being pregnant had nothing to do with it, sure, why should he be rewarded for his mistake? While me doing the right thing doesn't get anything. I hate that shit. \n\nThe worst part is I can't say anything without sounding like an ungrateful dick, and they would just make excuses like my brother did.

    "Instruction:\n\nGiven this paragraph about Chinese cuisine, tell me what are the sub-cuisines, and what made them different.Context:\n\nChinese cuisine encompasses the numerous cuisines originating from China, as well as overseas cuisines created by the Chinese diaspora. Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia and beyond, with modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples such as rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea, chili oil, and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be found worldwide.\n\nThe preferences for seasoning and cooking techniques of Chinese provinces depend on differences in social class, religion, historical background, and ethnic groups. Geographic features including mountains, rivers, forests, and deserts also have a strong effect on the local available ingredients, considering that the climate of China varies from tropical in the south to subarctic in the northeast. Imperial royal and noble preference also plays a role in the change of Chinese cuisine. Because of imperial expansion and trading, ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures have been integrated into Chinese cuisines over time.\n\nThere are numerous regional, religious, and ethnic styles of Chinese cuisine found within China and abroad. Chinese cuisine is highly diverse and most frequently categorized into provincial divisions, although these province-level classifications consist of many more styles within themselves. The most praised Four Great Traditions in Chinese cuisine are Chuan, Lu, Yue, and Huaiyang, representing cuisines of West, North, South, and East China, respectively. The modern Eight Cuisines of China are Anhui (\u5fbd\u83dc; Hu\u012bc\u00e0i), Guangdong (\u7ca4\u83dc; Yu\u00e8c\u00e0i), Fujian (\u95fd\u83dc; M\u01d0nc\u00e0i), Hunan (\u6e58\u83dc; Xi\u0101ngc\u00e0i), Jiangsu (\u82cf\u83dc; S\u016bc\u00e0i), Shandong (\u9c81\u83dc; L\u01d4c\u00e0i), Sichuan (\u5ddd\u83dc; Chu\u0101nc\u00e0i), and Zhejiang (\u6d59\u83dc; Zh\u00e8c\u00e0i) cuisines.\n\n\nA Quanjude cook is slicing Peking roast duck. Peking duck is eaten by rolling pieces of duck with scallion, cucumber and sweet bean sauce using steamed pancakes.\nColor, scent and taste are the three traditional aspects used to describe Chinese food, as well as the meaning, appearance, and nutrition of the food. Cooking should be appraised with respect to the ingredients used, knife work, cooking time, and seasoning.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe modern Chinese cuisine were broken down into 8 different styles of local cuisine, which are Anhui, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan , Jiangsu , Shandong, Sichuan, and Zhejiang cuisines. They are different because of many reasons, such as geographic features and climate which shaped the locals to specialize in certain ingredients or flavors, as well as religion and ethnic groups.\n\n",

I get quit a bit of memory loss, am easily convinced and biddable when drunk and just completely obliterated at most times when I'm drinking.\nLast week I was at a party and was rescued by my brother after I locked myself in the bathroom. We're fraternal twins and very close. My friends have done so much rescuing that most are tired of it by now, so I'm glad he was available.

    "Context:\n\nPain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage.\"\n\nPain motivates us to withdraw from damaging situations, to protect a damaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar experiences in the future. Most pain resolves once the noxious stimulus is removed and the body has healed, but it may persist despite removal of the stimulus and apparent healing of the body. Sometimes pain arises in the absence of any detectable stimulus, damage or disease.\n\nInstruction:\n\nIs there any benefit to pain?Answer:\n\nPain helps us withdraw from further severe damage to body\n\n",

    "Context:\n\nThe ANT catalog (or TAO catalog) is a classified product catalog by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) of which the version written in 2008\u20132009 was published by German news magazine Der Spiegel in December 2013. Forty-nine catalog pages with pictures, diagrams and descriptions of espionage devices and spying software were published. The items are available to the Tailored Access Operations unit and are mostly targeted at products from US companies such as Apple, Cisco and Dell. The source is believed to be someone different than Edward Snowden, who is largely responsible for the global surveillance disclosures since 2013. Companies whose products could be compromised have denied any collaboration with the NSA in developing these capabilities. In 2014, a project was started to implement the capabilities from the ANT catalog as open-source hardware and software.\n\nBackground\nThe Tailored Access Operations unit has existed since the late 90s. Its mission is to collect intelligence on foreign targets of the United States by hacking into computers and telecommunication networks.\n\nIn 2012, Edward Snowden organized a CryptoParty together with Runa Sandvik, a former colleague of Jacob Appelbaum at The Tor Project. In June 2013, Snowden took internal NSA documents which he shared with Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, resulting in the global surveillance disclosures. It has been speculated for years before that capabilities like those in the ANT catalog existed.\n\nPublication\nJacob Appelbaum co-authored the English publication in Der Spiegel with Christian St\u00f6cker  and Judith Horchert, which was publicized on 29 December 2013. The related English publication on the same day about the TAO by Der Spiegel was also authored by the same people, and including Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach, J\u00f6rg Schindler and Holger Stark. On December 30, Appelbaum gave a lecture about \"the militarization of the Internet\" at the 30th Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg, Germany. At the end of his talk, he encouraged NSA employees to leak more documents.\n\nApple denied the allegations that it collaborated on the development of DROPOUTJEEP in a statement to journalist Arik Hesseldahl from All Things Digital (part of the Wall Street Journal's Digital Network). The Verge questioned how the program developed in later years, since the document was composed in the early period of the iPhone and smartphones in general. Dell denied collaborating with any government in general, including the US government. John Stewart, senior vice president and chief security officer of Cisco stated that they were \"deeply concerned and will continue to pursue all avenues to determine if we need to address any new issues.\" Juniper stated that they were working actively to address any possible exploit paths. Huawei stated they would take appropriate audits to determine if any compromise had taken place and would communicate if that had taken place. NSA declined to comment on the publication by Der Spiegel.\n\nSource\nThe source who leaked the ANT catalog to the press is unknown as of 2023.\n\nAuthor James Bamford, who is specialized in the United States intelligence agencies, noted in a commentary article published by Reuters that Appelbaum has not identified the source who leaked the ANT catalog to him, which led people to mistakenly assume it was Edward Snowden. Bamford got unrestricted access to the documents cache from Edward Snowden and could not find any references to the ANT catalog using automated search tools, thereby concluding that the documents were not leaked by him. Security expert Bruce Schneier has stated on his blog that he also believes the ANT catalog did not come from Snowden, but from a second leaker. Officials at the NSA did not believe that the web crawler used by Snowden touched the ANT catalog and started looking for other people who could have leaked the catalog.\n\nContent\nThe published catalog pages were written between 2008 and 2009. The price of the items ranged from free up to $250,000.\n\nCapabilities in the ANT catalog \nPage\tCode name\tDescription\tUnit price in US$\nNSA CANDYGRAM.jpg\tCANDYGRAM\tTripwire device that emulates a GSM cellphone tower.\t40,000\nNSA COTTONMOUTH-I.jpg\tCOTTONMOUTH-I\tFamily of modified USB and Ethernet connectors that can be used to install Trojan horse software and work as wireless bridges, providing covert remote access to the target machine.

Most of the surveillance tools can be recreated with off-the-shelf or open-source hardware and software. Thus far, the NSA Playset consists of fourteen items, for which the code and instructions can be found online on the project's homepage. After the initial leak, Michael Ossman, the founder of Great Scott Gadgets, gave a shout out to other security researchers to start working on the tools mentioned in the catalog and to recreate them. The name NSA Playset came originally from Dean Pierce, who is also a contributor (TWILIGHTVEGETABLE(GSM)) to the NSA Playset. Anyone is invited to join and contribute their own device. The requisites for an addition to the NSA Playset is a similar or already existing NSA ANT project, ease of use and a silly name (based on the original tool's name if possible). The silly name requisite is a rule that Michael Ossman himself came up with and an example is given on the project's website: \"For example, if your project is similar to FOXACID, maybe you could call it COYOTEMETH.\" The ease of use part stems also from the NSA Playset's motto: \"If a 10 year old can't do it, it doesn't count!\"\n\nName\tDescription\nTWILIGHTVEGETABLE\ta boot image for GSM communication monitoring.\nLEVITICUS\ta hand held GSM frequency analyzer disguised as a Motorola phone; named after GENESIS.\nDRIZZLECHAIR\ta hard drive with all the needed tools to crack A5/1 including the rainbow tables.\nPORCUPINEMASQUERADE\ta passive Wi-Fi reconnaissance drone.\nKEYSWEEPER\ta keylogger in form of a USB wall charger, that wirelessly and passively sniffs, decrypts, logs and reports back (over GSM).\nSLOTSCREAMER\ta PCI hardware implant, which can access memory and IO.\nADAPTERNOODLE\ta USB exploitation device.\nCHUKWAGON\tuses a pin on a computer's VGA port to attack via the I\u00b2C bus accessing the computer's operating system.\nTURNIPSCHOOL\ta hardware implant concealed in a USB cable which provides short range radio frequency communication capability to software running on the host computer.\nBLINKERCOUGH\ta hardware implant that is embedded in a VGA cable which allows data exfiltration.\nSAVIORBURST\ta hardware implant exploiting the JTAG interface for software application persistence; named after GODSURGE.

    "Context:\n\nDoleshwor Mahadeva (Nepali: \u0921\u094b\u0932\u0947\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0926\u0947\u0935) is a Hindu Temple of Lord Shiva located in Suryabinayak, south eastern part of Bhaktapur District, Nepal, and is believed to be the head part of Kedarnath temple located in Uttarakhand, India.\n\nHistory\nFor 4000 years people have been searching for the head of the Panch Kedar temples, a bull who was Shiva in reality, who assumed the shape of a bull to avoid the five Pandava brothers, the heroes of the Mahabharat. The legend goes back to the fabled battle of Kurukshetra fought between the five Pandava brothers and their cousins, the 100 Kaurava brothers, which is the pivot of the Mahabharata. Many folk legends related to the Garhwal region, Lord Shiva and the creation of the Panch Kedar temples are narrated.\n\nA folk legend about Panch Kedar relates to the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The Pandavas defeated and slayed their cousins \u2014 the Kauravas in the epic Kurukshetra war. They wished to atone for the sins of committing fratricide (gotra hatya) and Br\u0101hmanahatya (killing of Brahmins \u2014 the priest class) during the war. Thus, they handed over the reins of their kingdom to their kin and left in search of lord Shiva and to seek his blessings. First, they went to the holy city of Varanasi (Kashi), believed to be Shiva's favourite city and known for its Kashi Vishwanath Temple. But, Shiva wanted to avoid them as he was deeply incensed by the death and dishonesty at the Kurukshetra war and was, therefore, insensitive to Pandavas' prayers. Therefore, he assumed the form of a bull (Nandi) and hid in the Garhwal region.\n\nNot finding Shiva in Varanasi, the Pandavas went to Garhwal Himalayas. Bhima, the second of the five Pandava brothers, then standing astride two mountains started to look for Shiva. He saw a bull grazing near Guptakashi (\u201chidden Kashi\u201d \u2014 the name derived from the hiding act of Shiva). Bhima immediately recognized the bull to be Shiva. Bhima caught hold of the bull by its tail and hind legs. But the bull-formed Shiva disappeared into the ground to later reappear in parts, with the hump raising in Kedarnath, the arms appearing in Tungnath, the face showing up at Rudranath, the nabhi (navel) and stomach surfacing in Madhyamaheshwar and the hair appearing in Kalpeshwar. The Pandavas pleased with this reappearance in five different forms, built temples at the five places for venerating and worshipping Shiva. The Pandavas were thus freed from their sins. It is also believed that the fore portions of Shiva appeared at Doleshwor Mahadeva Temple, Bhaktapur district Nepal.\n\nA variant of the tale credits Bhima of not only catching the bull, but also stopping it from disappearing. Consequently, the bull was torn asunder into five parts and appeared at five locations in the Kedar Khand of Garhwal region of the Himalayas. After building the Panch Kedar Temples, the Pandavas meditated at Kedarnath for salvation, performed yagna (fire sacrifice) and then through the heavenly path called the Mahapanth (also called Swargarohini), attained heaven or salvation.[citation needed]. The Panch Kedar Temples are constructed in the North-Indian Himalayan Temple architecture with the Kedarnath, Tungnath and Madhyamaheshwar temples looking similar.\n\nAfter completing the pilgrimage of Lord Shiva's darshan at the Panch Kedar Temples, it is an unwritten religious rite to visit Lord Vishnu at the Badrinath Temple, as a final affirmatory proof by the devotee that he has sought blessings of Lord Shiva.\n\nResearch and findings\nThe Hindu activist Bharat Jangam had been researching and claiming that Doleshwar Mahadev is the head part of Kedarnath based on the surprising links between Kedarnath and Doleshwor. The Sculptures of Shive found in both shrines are 4,000 years old. Even a stone scripture found in Doleshwor was written in Sanskrit and Old Nepalese.

    "Context:\n\nDeep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.\n\nDeep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks and transformers have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.\n\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems. ANNs have various differences from biological brains. Specifically, artificial neural networks tend to be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analog.\n\nThe adjective \"deep\" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Early work showed that a linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier, but that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can. Deep learning is a modern variation that is concerned with an unbounded number of layers of bounded size, which permits practical application and optimized implementation, while retaining theoretical universality under mild conditions. In deep learning the layers are also permitted to be heterogeneous and to deviate widely from biologically informed connectionist models, for the sake of efficiency, trainability and understandability.\n\nInstruction:\n\nWhat is deep learning?Answer:\n\nDeep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.\n\n",

(TL;DR at bottom)\nPOST: Hello everyone, this is one of my first few posts here on Reddit, mostly a lurker but would like to become part of this awesome community, so please excuse me if this isn't the right place to ask this.\n\nMy girlfriend of five years is turning the big 21 in almost two weeks. Due to our busy schedules with school we aren't allowed as much time as we would like to bring in enough income to do a lot of fun things or even buy each other something nice for our birthdays. We usually don't do much other than just hang out which is fine, but I really want to make her feel special because the past year and a half of school has put a tremendous amount of stress on her. She's going to school to become a nurse and she holds her GPA at 4.0.\n\nI've been saving up money for a while to get her a nice watch because she has wanted one for quite some time now. This is where I have encountered my problem.\n\nI know the kinds she likes, but in previous attempts to buy her gifts at the beginning of our relationship I bought her a gift that she told me she loved and used it for quite some time only to find out later that she didn't really like it while being to embarrassed to tell me and hurt my feelings.\n\nI know if I spend $200-$300 I have on a watch I want her to LOVE it, but I'm not very good with girls fashion and what not as I'm pretty plain when it comes to fashion.\n\nI've narrowed down my choices to these following watches in no particular order:\n\nShe's shown me watches similar to these, I did my best to try and find ones she's shown me previously.\n\nIf you're still here with me reading this post, thank you sooooooo much! I can answer any questions you might need to know about her and what she likes. I will be posting a picture of us soon so you can get a better idea of her.\n\nIf any of you out here on Reddit could be so kind to take time out of your busy day and help me surprise my wonderful, beautiful girlfriend who very much deserves something nice for herself it would be much appreciated!\n\nPrompt:\n\nTL;DR\n\nResponse:\n\nI'm afraid of buying an expensive (for me) watch for my girlfriends 21st birthday that she might not fully like and would be too embarrassed to tell me she doesnt want it while still wearing it anyway.\n\n",

Well, I know I'm frustrated and overwhelmed. \n\nAfter reading posts here, I've been attempting to teach our two dogs a \"quiet\" cue. One is a coonhound, the other is some sort of hound mix, and they're both terrible with outside noises. People walking past with or without dogs, large trucks, and the mailman. Going ballistic, baying, the whole nine yards. The mailman is the worst. I work from home so I get to hear it daily and it affects my ability to get anything done (besides that I don't want to annoy the neighbors or have anxious dogs). We've been trying to manage with bark collars but I realize now that that's lazy and unfair to them. \n\nI've been trying to teach the \"quiet\" cue by treating when they're calm and the coonhound seems to have mostly picked it up. She barks, I call her name and tell her \"quiet,\" she comes running for a cookie, and she settles down. Even works during mailman time. The hound mix seems to know that \"quiet\" means \"stop and get a cookie\" and it works any time but mailman time. Mailman time (which is 30-45 minutes) is a horror show. I can't even get her attention by calling her name, never mind using any commands. \n\nI really am not sure what to do at this point. Do I stick with the \"quiet\" cue and hope she decides to care? Do I try to acknowledge her barking so she thinks she's done her job? Do I try to counter condition when it's mailman time? I honestly feel stupid just posting this but I get so frustrated. She's my SO's dog and is 10, and he really never trained her properly so I'm always worried that this stuff can't be undone and I get stuck doing it. Sigh.\n\nPrompt:\n\nTL;DR\n\nResponse:\n\nDog not giving a shit about \"quiet\" when it's mailman time, do I just pray it gets better and keep on, or change tactics?\n\n",

    "Instruction:\n\nWhat is the biggest passenger airliner?Context:\n\nThe Airbus A380 is a large wide-body airliner that was developed and produced by Airbus. It is the world's largest passenger airliner and only full-length double-deck jet airliner. Airbus studies started in 1988, and the project was announced in 1990 to challenge the dominance of the Boeing 747 in the long-haul market. The then-designated A3XX project was presented in 1994; Airbus launched the \u20ac9.5 billion ($10.7 billion) A380 programme on 19 December 2000. The first prototype was unveiled in Toulouse on 18 January 2005, with its first flight on 27 April 2005. It then obtained its type certificate from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on 12 December 2006.\n\nDue to difficulties with the electrical wiring, the initial production was delayed by two years and the development costs almost doubled. It was first delivered to Singapore Airlines on 15 October 2007 and entered service on 25 October. Production peaked at 30 per year in 2012 and 2014. However, after the largest customer, Emirates, reduced its last order in February 2019, Airbus announced that A380 production would end in 2021. On 16 December 2021, Emirates received its 123rd A380, which was the 251st and last delivered by Airbus. The $25 billion investment was not recouped.\n\nThe full-length double-deck aircraft has a typical seating for 525 passengers, with a maximum certified capacity for 853 passengers. The quadjet is powered by Engine Alliance GP7200 or Rolls-Royce Trent 900 turbofans providing a range of 8,000 nmi (14,800 km). As of December 2021, the global A380 fleet had completed more than 800,000 flights over 7.3 million block hours with no fatalities and no hull losses. As of December 2022, there were 237 aircraft in service with 16 operators worldwide.\n\nAnswer:\n\nA380 is the largest passenger airliner.

I have had my fits of depression and fought through them, I am far beyond my days of hating myself. Over the past year or so I have taken a step back and evaluated myself and my environment and always had the feeling that I am a lone wolf. I am perfectly okay with this. I've never been the person to be especially extroverted. I have always been more content sitting by myself than being around a number of less than consistent acquaintances. I've had only one other individual whom I can relate with and open up to, he is my only true \"friend\". During this evaluation of self I have always had a burning desire to just pack up and leave my home town. I've always wanted to travel and experience the world around me. My best friend has always referred to us as the two people everyone is going to sit around and ask \"hey do you remember so and so, I wonder what ever happened to them?\" and always felt a sense of reassurance from that. I want to be the person who makes something of their lives, not in a financial aspect as money has never been an appealing goal in my life, but in experience. I love to meet interesting people and just sit and listen to them. My motto over the past couple years has been that there are several billion people in this world, why not meet a few? Which leads me to wanting to just pack up one night and drive into the sunset without saying a word to anyone, only keeping in touch with family and my best friend.

    "Instruction:\n\nwhat is use of cryogenics in virology ?Context:\n\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the most common methods to determine the physical and chemical properties of atoms by detecting the radio frequency absorbed and subsequent relaxation of nuclei in a magnetic field. This is one of the most commonly used characterisation techniques and has applications in numerous fields. Primarily, the strong magnetic fields are generated by supercooling electromagnets, although there are spectrometers that do not require cryogens. In traditional superconducting solenoids, liquid helium is used to cool the inner coils because it has a boiling point of around 4 K at ambient pressure. Cheap metallic superconductors can be used for the coil wiring. So-called high-temperature superconducting compounds can be made to super conduct with the use of liquid nitrogen, which boils at around 77 K.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a complex application of NMR where the geometry of the resonances is deconvoluted and used to image objects by detecting the relaxation of protons that have been perturbed by a radio-frequency pulse in the strong magnetic field. This is most commonly used in health applications.\nIn large cities, it is difficult to transmit power by overhead cables, so underground cables are used. But underground cables get heated and the resistance of the wire increases, leading to waste of power. Superconductors could be used to increase power throughput, although they would require cryogenic liquids such as nitrogen or helium to cool special alloy-containing cables to increase power transmission. Several feasibility studies have been performed and the field is the subject of an agreement within the International Energy Agency.\n\nCryogenic gases delivery truck at a supermarket, Ypsilanti, Michigan\nCryogenic gases are used in transportation and storage of large masses of frozen food. When very large quantities of food must be transported to regions like war zones, earthquake hit regions, etc., they must be stored for a long time, so cryogenic food freezing is used. Cryogenic food freezing is also helpful for large scale food processing industries.\nMany infrared (forward looking infrared) cameras require their detectors to be cryogenically cooled.\nCertain rare blood groups are stored at low temperatures, such as \u2212165 \u00b0C, at blood banks.\nCryogenics technology using liquid nitrogen and CO2 has been built into nightclub effect systems to create a chilling effect and white fog that can be illuminated with colored lights.\nCryogenic cooling is used to cool the tool tip at the time of machining in manufacturing process. It increases the tool life. Oxygen is used to perform several important functions in the steel manufacturing process.\nMany rockets use cryogenic gases as propellants. These include liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen, and liquid methane.\nBy freezing the automobile or truck tire in liquid nitrogen, the rubber is made brittle and can be crushed into small particles. These particles can be used again for other items.\nExperimental research on certain physics phenomena, such as spintronics and magnetotransport properties, requires cryogenic temperatures for the effects to be observed.\nCertain vaccines must be stored at cryogenic temperatures. For example, the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine must be stored at temperatures of \u221290 to \u221260 \u00b0C (\u2212130 to \u221276 \u00b0F).

    "Instruction:\n\nWhat is Cricket in sports?Context:\n\nCricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are \"out\"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.\n\nForms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (each \"over\" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasting three hours, to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.\n\nAnswer:\n\nCricket is highly popular game that's originated in south-eastern counties of England and now prominent sport in a number of countries in particular south asian countries like India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.\nIt is in essence a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field.

It has an area of 6.7 km2 (2.6 sq mi) and is bordered to the north by Spain. The landscape is dominated by the Rock of Gibraltar, at the foot of which is a densely populated town area, home to over 32,000 people, primarily Gibraltarians.\n\nIn 1704, Anglo-Dutch forces captured Gibraltar from Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession. The territory was ceded to Great Britain in perpetuity under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. It became an important base for the Royal Navy, particularly during the Napoleonic Wars and World War II, as it controlled the narrow entrance and exit to the Mediterranean Sea, the Strait of Gibraltar, which is only 14.3 km (8.9 mi) wide. This choke point remains strategically important, with half the world's seaborne trade passing through it. Gibraltar's economy is based largely on tourism, online gambling, financial services, and bunkering.\n\nThe sovereignty of Gibraltar is a point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations, as Spain asserts a claim to the territory. Gibraltarians overwhelmingly rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty in a 1967 referendum, and for shared sovereignty in a 2002 referendum. Nevertheless, Gibraltar maintains close economic and cultural links with Spain, with many Gibraltarians speaking Spanish as well as a local dialect known as Llanito.\n\nSince Brexit, Gibraltar is not a member of the European Union but negotiations are underway to have it participate in the Schengen Agreement to facilitate border movements between Gibraltar and Spain.

    "Context:\n\nRacial categories have historically been used as a way to enable an oppressive figure or group to discriminate against other groups or individuals which were seen as different from that of the oppressor. In nineteenth and early twentieth century Europe, artwork was a common form of racialization which targeted countries in the Middle East and Asia. The artwork, predominantly paintings, were portrayed in order to instill prejudice in the Western populations through sexualizing and manipulating images. One of the most prominent examples of Orientalist work in art is a piece by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix titled Women of Algiers in their Apartment. Dating back to 1834, it portrays three women resting in a harem in exotic clothing while an African woman is dressed in plain clothing, depicting her role as a servant. Fine textiles, hookahs, and other paraphernalia adorn the room, which represents a European fantasy of an exotic scene. Attempts to portray these cultures as strange, foreign and exotic through Orientalism led to intolerance towards the Arab and Asian communities in Europe and the United States. Others argue that Delacroix, who travelled in North Africa sketching extensively, was depicting a realistic scene of the era based on his first-hand knowledge and experience. In such an interpretation the clothing, for example, is consistent with the times, as Arab North Africans dressed differently from Europeans, and kept black slaves who would not have been treated as equals.\n\nAnswer:\n\nIn the 19th to 20th century, Europeans commonly use artworks to portray prejudice towards Middle Eastern and Asian people.\n\nInstruction:\n\nHow was art used for manipulative purpose in racial discuss in the 20th century?\n\n",
    "Instruction:\n\nGiven this paragraph about surfboards, summarize what a surfboard is made ofContext:\n\nMost modern surfboards are made of fiberglass foam (PU), with one or more wooden strips or \"stringers\", fiberglass cloth, and polyester resin (PE). An emerging board material is epoxy resin and Expanded Polystyrene foam (EPS) which is stronger and lighter than traditional PU/PE construction. Even newer designs incorporate materials such as carbon fiber and variable-flex composites in conjunction with fiberglass and epoxy or polyester resins. Since epoxy/EPS surfboards are generally lighter, they will float better than a traditional PU/PE board of similar size, shape and thickness. This makes them easier to paddle and faster in the water. However, a common complaint of EPS boards is that they do not provide as much feedback as a traditional PU/PE board. For this reason, many advanced surfers prefer that their surfboards be made from traditional materials.\n\nAnswer:\n\nSurfboards can be made out of a variety of materials, but most surfboards these days are made from a foam core that is coated in a hard exterior\n\n",

    "Instruction:\n\nGiven these paragraphs about Multiomics, what is panomics?Context:\n\nMultiomics, multi-omics, integrative omics, \"panomics\" or \"pan-omics\" is a biological analysis approach in which the data sets are multiple \"omes\", such as the genome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome, metabolome, and microbiome (i.e., a meta-genome and/or meta-transcriptome, depending upon how it is sequenced); in other words, the use of multiple omics technologies to study life in a concerted way. By combining these \"omes\", scientists can analyze complex biological big data to find novel associations between biological entities, pinpoint relevant biomarkers and build elaborate markers of disease and physiology. In doing so, multiomics integrates diverse omics data to find a coherently matching geno-pheno-envirotype relationship or association. The OmicTools service lists more than 99 softwares related to multiomic data analysis, as well as more than 99 databases on the topic.\n\nSystems biology approaches are often based upon the use of panomic analysis data. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) defines panomics as referring to \"the interaction of all biological functions within a cell and with other body functions, combining data collected by targeted tests ... and global assays (such as genome sequencing) with other patient-specific information.\"\n\nSingle-cell multiomics\nA branch of the field of multiomics is the analysis of multilevel single-cell data, called single-cell multiomics. This approach gives us an unprecedent resolution to look at multilevel transitions in health and disease at the single cell level. An advantage in relation to bulk analysis is to mitigate confounding factors derived from cell to cell variation, allowing the uncovering of heterogeneous tissue architectures.\n\nMethods for parallel single-cell genomic and transcriptomic analysis can be based on simultaneous amplification or physical separation of RNA and genomic DNA. They allow insights that cannot be gathered solely from transcriptomic analysis, as RNA data do not contain non-coding genomic regions and information regarding copy-number variation, for example. An extension of this methodology is the integration of single-cell transcriptomes to single-cell methylomes, combining single-cell bisulfite sequencing to single cell RNA-Seq. Other techniques to query the epigenome, as single-cell ATAC-Seq and single-cell Hi-C also exist.\n\nA different, but related, challenge is the integration of proteomic and transcriptomic data. One approach to perform such measurement is to physically separate single-cell lysates in two, processing half for RNA, and half for proteins. The protein content of lysates can be measured by proximity extension assays (PEA), for example, which use DNA-barcoded antibodies. A different approach uses a combination of heavy-metal RNA probes and protein antibodies to adapt mass cytometry for multiomic analysis.\n\nMultiomics and machine learning\nIn parallel to the advances in highthroughput biology, machine learning applications to biomedical data analysis are flourishing.

    "Context:\n\nDoleshwor Mahadeva (Nepali: \u0921\u094b\u0932\u0947\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0926\u0947\u0935) is a Hindu Temple of Lord Shiva located in Suryabinayak, south eastern part of Bhaktapur District, Nepal, and is believed to be the head part of Kedarnath temple located in Uttarakhand, India.\n\nHistory\nFor 4000 years people have been searching for the head of the Panch Kedar temples, a bull who was Shiva in reality, who assumed the shape of a bull to avoid the five Pandava brothers, the heroes of the Mahabharat. The legend goes back to the fabled battle of Kurukshetra fought between the five Pandava brothers and their cousins, the 100 Kaurava brothers, which is the pivot of the Mahabharata. Many folk legends related to the Garhwal region, Lord Shiva and the creation of the Panch Kedar temples are narrated.\n\nA folk legend about Panch Kedar relates to the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The Pandavas defeated and slayed their cousins \u2014 the Kauravas in the epic Kurukshetra war. They wished to atone for the sins of committing fratricide (gotra hatya) and Br\u0101hmanahatya (killing of Brahmins \u2014 the priest class) during the war. Thus, they handed over the reins of their kingdom to their kin and left in search of lord Shiva and to seek his blessings. First, they went to the holy city of Varanasi (Kashi), believed to be Shiva's favourite city and known for its Kashi Vishwanath Temple. But, Shiva wanted to avoid them as he was deeply incensed by the death and dishonesty at the Kurukshetra war and was, therefore, insensitive to Pandavas' prayers. Therefore, he assumed the form of a bull (Nandi) and hid in the Garhwal region.\n\nNot finding Shiva in Varanasi, the Pandavas went to Garhwal Himalayas. Bhima, the second of the five Pandava brothers, then standing astride two mountains started to look for Shiva. He saw a bull grazing near Guptakashi (\u201chidden Kashi\u201d \u2014 the name derived from the hiding act of Shiva). Bhima immediately recognized the bull to be Shiva. Bhima caught hold of the bull by its tail and hind legs. But the bull-formed Shiva disappeared into the ground to later reappear in parts, with the hump raising in Kedarnath, the arms appearing in Tungnath, the face showing up at Rudranath, the nabhi (navel) and stomach surfacing in Madhyamaheshwar and the hair appearing in Kalpeshwar. The Pandavas pleased with this reappearance in five different forms, built temples at the five places for venerating and worshipping Shiva. The Pandavas were thus freed from their sins. It is also believed that the fore portions of Shiva appeared at Doleshwor Mahadeva Temple, Bhaktapur district Nepal.\n\nA variant of the tale credits Bhima of not only catching the bull, but also stopping it from disappearing. Consequently, the bull was torn asunder into five parts and appeared at five locations in the Kedar Khand of Garhwal region of the Himalayas. After building the Panch Kedar Temples, the Pandavas meditated at Kedarnath for salvation, performed yagna (fire sacrifice) and then through the heavenly path called the Mahapanth (also called Swargarohini), attained heaven or salvation.[citation needed]. The Panch Kedar Temples are constructed in the North-Indian Himalayan Temple architecture with the Kedarnath, Tungnath and Madhyamaheshwar temples looking similar.\n\nAfter completing the pilgrimage of Lord Shiva's darshan at the Panch Kedar Temples, it is an unwritten religious rite to visit Lord Vishnu at the Badrinath Temple, as a final affirmatory proof by the devotee that he has sought blessings of Lord Shiva.\n\nResearch and findings\nThe Hindu activist Bharat Jangam had been researching and claiming that Doleshwar Mahadev is the head part of Kedarnath based on the surprising links between Kedarnath and Doleshwor. The Sculptures of Shive found in both shrines are 4,000 years old. Even a stone scripture found in Doleshwor was written in Sanskrit and Old Nepalese. The priests in both shrines are selected from India's southern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Both priests affix the word \u2018ling\u2019 after their names to convey their proximity to the god as his worshipper and both temples have a cluster of five Shiva shrines. The main deity of both priests is Birbhadra, a companion of Shiva, according to Hindu scriptures. \n\nRecognition\nOn August 22, 2009 the head priest of Kedarnath peeth Shree 1008 Jagat Guru Bheemashankarling Shivacharya unveiled the plaque claiming that Doleswore Mahadev, located in Jangam math Bhaktapur, is the head part of Shri Kedarnath. He performed Rudra Abhishek, a special worshipping at the Doleshwor temple situated in Sipadol village of Bhaktapur district. This is also mentioned in the inscription (Sheela Lekh) at Doleshwar Mahadev. Thousands of devotees have been thronging in the Doleswor Mahadev Temple.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, Doleshwor Mahadeva (Nepali: \u0921\u094b\u0932\u0947\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0926\u0947\u0935) is a Hindu Temple of Lord Shiva located in Suryabinayak, south eastern part of Bhaktapur District, Nepal\n\nInstruction:\n\nHave you heard of Doleshwor Mahadeva temple?\n\n",

    "Context:\n\nRacial categories have historically been used as a way to enable an oppressive figure or group to discriminate against other groups or individuals which were seen as different from that of the oppressor. In nineteenth and early twentieth century Europe, artwork was a common form of racialization which targeted countries in the Middle East and Asia. The artwork, predominantly paintings, were portrayed in order to instill prejudice in the Western populations through sexualizing and manipulating images. One of the most prominent examples of Orientalist work in art is a piece by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix titled Women of Algiers in their Apartment. Dating back to 1834, it portrays three women resting in a harem in exotic clothing while an African woman is dressed in plain clothing, depicting her role as a servant. Fine textiles, hookahs, and other paraphernalia adorn the room, which represents a European fantasy of an exotic scene. Attempts to portray these cultures as strange, foreign and exotic through Orientalism led to intolerance towards the Arab and Asian communities in Europe and the United States. Others argue that Delacroix, who travelled in North Africa sketching extensively, was depicting a realistic scene of the era based on his first-hand knowledge and experience. In such an interpretation the clothing, for example, is consistent with the times, as Arab North Africans dressed differently from Europeans, and kept black slaves who would not have been treated as equals.\n\nInstruction:\n\nHow was art used for manipulative purpose in racial discuss in the 20th century?Answer:\n\nIn the 19th to 20th century, Europeans commonly use artworks to portray prejudice towards Middle Eastern and Asian people.\n\n",

    "Instruction:\n\nWhat is observer biasAnswer:\n\nObserver bias is one of the types of detection bias and is defined as any kind of systematic divergence from accurate facts during observation and the recording of data and information in studies. The definition can be further expanded upon to include the systematic difference between what is observed due to variation in observers, and what the true value is.\n\nObserver bias is the tendency of observers to not see what is there, but instead to see what they expect or want to see. This is a common occurrence in the everyday lives of many and is a significant problem that is sometimes encountered in scientific research and studies. Observation is critical to scientific research and activity, and as such, observer bias may be as well. When such biases exist, scientific studies can result in an over- or underestimation of what is true and accurate, which compromises the validity of the findings and results of the study, even if all other designs and procedures in the study were appropriate.\n\nObservational data forms the foundation of a significant body of knowledge. Observation is a method of data collection and falls into the category of qualitative research techniques. There are a number of benefits of observation, including its simplicity as a data collection method and its usefulness for hypotheses. Simultaneously, there are many limitations and disadvantages in the observation process, including the potential lack of reliability, poor validity, and faulty perception. Participants\u2019 observations are widely used in sociological and anthropological studies, while systematic observation is used where researchers need to collect data without participants direct interactions. The most common observation method is naturalistic observation, where subjects are observed in their natural environments with the goal to assess the behaviour in an intervention free and natural setting.\n\nObserver bias is especially probable when the investigator or researcher has vested interests in the outcome of the research or has strong preconceptions. Coupled with ambiguous underlying data and a subjective scoring method, these three factors contribute heavily to the incidence of observer bias.\n\nExamples of cognitive biases include:\n\nAnchoring \u2013 a cognitive bias that causes humans to place too much reliance on the initial pieces of information they are provided with for a topic. This causes a skew in judgement and prevents humans and observers from updating their plans and predictions as appropriate.\n\nBandwagon effect \u2013 the tendency for people to \u201cjump on the bandwagon\u201d with certain behaviours and attitudes, meaning that they adopt particular ways of doings things based on what others are doing.\n\nBias blind spot \u2013 the tendency for people to recognize the impact of bias on others and their judgements, while simultaneously failing to acknowledge and recognize the impact that their own biases have on their own judgement.\n\nConfirmation bias \u2013 the tendency for people to look for, interpret, and recall information in such a way that their preconceived beliefs and values are affirmed.\n\nGuilt and innocence by association bias \u2013 the tendency for people to hold an assumption that individuals within a group share similar characteristics and behaviours, including those that would hail them as innocent or guilty.\n\nHalo effect \u2013 the tendency for the positive impressions and beliefs in one area around a person, brand, company, product or the like to influence an observers opinions or feelings in other unrelated areas.\n\nFraming effect \u2013 the tendency for people to form conclusions and opinions based on whether the pertinent relevant is provided to them with positive or negative connotations.\n\nRecency effect \u2013 the tendency for more recent pieces of information, ideas, or arguments to be remembered more clearly than those that preceded.\n\n",

Credited for starting the northern European Christian black metal scene, Antestor is the only Christian band to have an album released by Cacophonous Records, which has also released records by bands such as Dimmu Borgir, Sigh, and Cradle of Filth. The band's only release on Cacophonous, The Return of the Black Death, proved influential for the Christian black metal movement, and has sold over 10,000 copies.\n\nIn the late 1990s they dubbed their musical style as \"sorrow metal\" rather than black metal because the black metal movement was publicly affiliated with Satanism in Norway. According to HM magazine, the progressive elements on the debut album, Martyrium, were possibly ahead of their time in the Norwegian extreme metal scene.\n\nThe group has gone through several line-up changes over the years, and currently Antestor consists of the founding guitarist Lars Stokstad (Vemod), vocalist Ronny Hansen (Vrede), bassist Erik Normann Aanonsen, guitarist Robert Bordevick, and drummer Henning B\u00f8rven. The original vocalist Kjetil Molnes (Martyr) and drummer Svein Sander (Armoth) left the band around 2000, and the members of a fellow Norwegian black metal group, Vaakevandring, joined Antestor. The reputable Norwegian extreme metal drummer Jan Axel Blomberg (Hellhammer) played session drums for their 2005 album The Forsaken and Det tapte liv EP. A fourth studio album, Omen, was released in 2012.\n\nAnswer:\n\nBecause black metal was associated with Satanism in Antestor's home country Norway, and they are a Christian extreme metal band.\n\n",

The overall shape of the shell is conical, with a pointed apex and a wider base.\n\nThe coloration of the shell can vary widely, but it basically has a base color of white or cream, with a series of darker or lighter bands, blotches, or spots that form complex patterns. The patterns can be quite intricate and unique, which is one reason why cone snails are prized by collectors.\n\nLike all cone snails, Conus Episcopatus is venomous and uses its venom to immobilize and kill its prey.

    "Instruction:\n\nGiven these paragraphs about battery storage power stations, what was the levelized cost of electricity from battery storage as of 2020?Context:\n\nAs of 2021, the power and capacity of the largest individual battery storage power plants is an order of magnitude less than that of the largest pumped storage power plants, the most common form of grid energy storage. For example, the Bath County Pumped Storage Station, the second largest in the world, can store 24GWh of electricity and dispatch 3GW while the first phase of Vistra Energy's Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility can store 1.2GWh and dispatch 300MW. Grid batteries do not however have to be large, and smaller ones can be deployed widely across a grid for greater redundancy.\n\nAs of 2019, battery power storage is cheaper than open cycle gas turbine power for use up to two hours, and there was around 365 GWh of battery storage deployed worldwide, growing extremely rapidly. Levelized cost of electricity from battery storage has fallen rapidly, halving in two years to US$150 per MWh as of 2020.\n\nAnswer:\n\nUS$150 per MWh.\n\n",
    "Context:\n\nCorsica was ruled by the Republic of Genoa from 1284 to 1755, when it seceded to become a self-proclaimed, Italian-speaking Republic. In 1768, Genoa officially ceded it to Louis XV of France as part of a pledge for the debts it had incurred by enlisting France's military help in suppressing the Corsican revolt, and as a result France went on to annex it in 1769. The future Emperor of the French, Napoleon Bonaparte, was a native Corsican, born that same year in Ajaccio: his ancestral home, Maison Bonaparte, is today a visitor attraction and museum. Because of Corsica's historical ties to Tuscany, the island has retained many Italian cultural elements and many Corsican surnames are rooted in the Italian peninsula.\n\nInstruction:\n\nGiven this paragraph about Corsica, when was Napoleon Bonaparte born and where?Answer:\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte was born in 1769, the same year that France annexed Corsica.

    "Context:\n\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the most common methods to determine the physical and chemical properties of atoms by detecting the radio frequency absorbed and subsequent relaxation of nuclei in a magnetic field. This is one of the most commonly used characterisation techniques and has applications in numerous fields. Primarily, the strong magnetic fields are generated by supercooling electromagnets, although there are spectrometers that do not require cryogens. In traditional superconducting solenoids, liquid helium is used to cool the inner coils because it has a boiling point of around 4 K at ambient pressure. Cheap metallic superconductors can be used for the coil wiring. So-called high-temperature superconducting compounds can be made to super conduct with the use of liquid nitrogen, which boils at around 77 K.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a complex application of NMR where the geometry of the resonances is deconvoluted and used to image objects by detecting the relaxation of protons that have been perturbed by a radio-frequency pulse in the strong magnetic field. This is most commonly used in health applications.\nIn large cities, it is difficult to transmit power by overhead cables, so underground cables are used. But underground cables get heated and the resistance of the wire increases, leading to waste of power. Superconductors could be used to increase power throughput, although they would require cryogenic liquids such as nitrogen or helium to cool special alloy-containing cables to increase power transmission. Several feasibility studies have been performed and the field is the subject of an agreement within the International Energy Agency.\n\nCryogenic gases delivery truck at a supermarket, Ypsilanti, Michigan\nCryogenic gases are used in transportation and storage of large masses of frozen food. When very large quantities of food must be transported to regions like war zones, earthquake hit regions, etc., they must be stored for a long time, so cryogenic food freezing is used. Cryogenic food freezing is also helpful for large scale food processing industries.\nMany infrared (forward looking infrared) cameras require their detectors to be cryogenically cooled.\nCertain rare blood groups are stored at low temperatures, such as \u2212165 \u00b0C, at blood banks.\nCryogenics technology using liquid nitrogen and CO2 has been built into nightclub effect systems to create a chilling effect and white fog that can be illuminated with colored lights.\nCryogenic cooling is used to cool the tool tip at the time of machining in manufacturing process. It increases the tool life. Oxygen is used to perform several important functions in the steel manufacturing process.\nMany rockets use cryogenic gases as propellants. These include liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen, and liquid methane.\nBy freezing the automobile or truck tire in liquid nitrogen, the rubber is made brittle and can be crushed into small particles. These particles can be used again for other items.\nExperimental research on certain physics phenomena, such as spintronics and magnetotransport properties, requires cryogenic temperatures for the effects to be observed.\nCertain vaccines must be stored at cryogenic temperatures. For example, the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine must be stored at temperatures of \u221290 to \u221260 \u00b0C (\u2212130 to \u221276 \u00b0F).

They can also be oval, spear-shaped, or in many other possible shape variations. The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. A quality of philodendrons is that they do not have a single type of leaf on the same plant. Instead, they have juvenile leaves and adult leaves, which can be drastically different from one another. The leaves of seedling philodendrons are usually heart-shaped early in the life of the plant. But after it has matured past the seedling stage, the leaves will acquire the typical juvenile leaf's shape and size. Later in the philodendron's life, it starts producing adult leaves, a process called metamorphosis. Most philodendrons go through metamorphosis gradually; there is no immediately distinct difference between juvenile and adult leaves. Aside from being typically much bigger than the juvenile leaves, the shape of adult leaves can be significantly different.

Vaughan used a custom set of uncommonly heavy strings, gauges .013, .015, .019, .028, .038, .058, and tuned a half-step below standard tuning. With these heavy string sizes, it was not uncommon for him to separate his fingernail because of his quick movement along the strings. The owner of an Austin club recalled Vaughan coming into the office between sets to borrow super glue, which he used to keep a fingernail split from widening while he continued to play. The super glue was suggested by Rene Martinez, who was Stevie's guitar technician. Martinez eventually convinced Stevie to change to slightly lighter strings. He preferred a guitar neck with an asymmetrical profile (thicker at the top), which was more comfortable for his thumb-over style of playing. Heavy use of the vibrato bar necessitated frequent replacements; Vaughan often had his roadie, Byron Barr, obtain custom stainless steel bars made by Barr's father.

    "Instruction:\n\nWhat shape are Philodendron leaves?Context:\n\nThe leaves are usually large and imposing, often lobed or deeply cut, and may be more or less pinnate. They can also be oval, spear-shaped, or in many other possible shape variations. The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. A quality of philodendrons is that they do not have a single type of leaf on the same plant. Instead, they have juvenile leaves and adult leaves, which can be drastically different from one another. The leaves of seedling philodendrons are usually heart-shaped early in the life of the plant. But after it has matured past the seedling stage, the leaves will acquire the typical juvenile leaf's shape and size. Later in the philodendron's life, it starts producing adult leaves, a process called metamorphosis. Most philodendrons go through metamorphosis gradually; there is no immediately distinct difference between juvenile and adult leaves. Aside from being typically much bigger than the juvenile leaves, the shape of adult leaves can be significantly different.

    "Context:\n\nThough the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.\n\nThough trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to \"memorize\" a great quantity of facts during training.\n\nInstruction:\n\nWhat is the formal definition of a large language model?Answer:\n\nThe term large language model (LLM) does not have a formal definition.

Here is an example in the past day or so that has caused me to be confused and feel as if I needed to post to this subreddit.\n\nFirst-- I am in college, and my bf and I both live in a dorm. Now, we both have discussed our desire to get married to each other. So, I am about a 10 min walk away from our dorm, when I realize that I forgot my calculator for an exam that was in the next hour. I had been hoping to study for this exam, and forgetting the calculator meant that instead I would have to spend the 30 mins walking to go get it instead of being able to study. I texted my bf asking him to bring it to me, but he didn't answer for a while, so I just walked back. I realize he probably was not maliciously ignoring my texts, but I know that there was no chance he would have brought me my calculator if it meant a 20 min walk for him. This is a situation where we have actually been in the exact opposite, and he forgot his calculator, and I offered to run to him with it.\n\nI realize that part of it is his pride-- while I ask for him to bring me my calculator, and he doesn't, he would never ask it of me, and I offer it.\n\nWhen he doesn't bring it to me, I get snippy. I realize this is probably not the most mature response, but it's the fact that I don't feel like the relationship is equal if he does not feel willing to do the things that I feel willing to do.\n\nWhat do you think?

As the title says, my wife and I have caught her 8 year old son stealing twice now. Like a lot of kids at his age, he recently discovered Pokemon, but it isn't Go or the TV show or the video games he's interested in. It's the cards.\n\nLast month was the first time: he stole $60 from a place my wife was saving loose cash. We didn't know about it because we didn't check that often. But then a $100 bill went missing from my wallet. Wife got him to confess, he stole the money ($160) to buy Pokemon cards, but he had no plan on how to spend it without getting caught. He managed to spend $25 on food at a daycare field trip, but we recovered the rest. We grounded him for a month to pay back the missing money ($5 a week allowance).\n\nOver this past month, we still bought him some cards, as he had been doing reasonably well with the grounding and we figured we should reward him. Obviously this wasn't enough, as a friend's mother came to our house today and told us our son had stolen a dozen of the kid's cards. Our kid confessed to her son at a sleepover the night previously, but since our son doesn't take care of the cards (carries them in his pocket, get's them wet), they were destroyed and now we'll have to replace them by buying individually online.\n\nSome possible contributing factors: we moved across the country last year, and so he has only seen his grandparents twice since, when he used to see them every week. He has had to make all new friends in a new area and we are well aware that that can be stressful. Also, my wife recently became pregnant and our son now knows he will no longer be an only child. Finally, the pregnancy as well as a lower paying job for myself in an area with much higher living expenses has added some stress to the at-home environment. We try to keep the stress out of the house, but I'm sure it's obvious to a smart kid like our son.\nAs parents, we've never had to deal with anything like this so, got any advice for me?\n\nPrompt:\n\nTL;DR\n\nResponse:\n\nSon is into Pokemon cards and has been caught stealing money from us and cards from his friends to build his collection.

We were still talking and he said it wasn't a date and that the rest was none of my business. The girl that he was out with reached out to me and said she had a boyfriend. I still think the whole thing is way too strange. \n\nAnyways, I said some pretty horrible things that I've been trying to apologize for. He wants nothing to do with me and I don't entirely blame him. Before I said those things he wanted me around. We were still hanging out.They were pretty mean and over reacted but what's a girl going to do when three days before he admits to messing up. So then you have hope and then its just shattered in an instant. Also, then you get odd messages from the other girl involved saying she has a boyfriend already and she says she's put date night on everything. Not really sure about that but it seemed strange for her to reach out to me.\n\nSo I decided to write him. I have half a journal filled with some of our early conversations and my personal journal entries during the relationship.\n\nI'm planning on leaving it at his door and just waiting to see if he ever says anything. \n\nAnyone think he'll actually read it?\n\nPrompt:\n\nTL;DR\n\nResponse:\n\ncame up with writing to ex to see if he would let me apologize how I last behaved.

    "Context:\n\nThe Airbus A380 is a large wide-body airliner that was developed and produced by Airbus. It is the world's largest passenger airliner and only full-length double-deck jet airliner. Airbus studies started in 1988, and the project was announced in 1990 to challenge the dominance of the Boeing 747 in the long-haul market. The then-designated A3XX project was presented in 1994; Airbus launched the \u20ac9.5 billion ($10.7 billion) A380 programme on 19 December 2000. The first prototype was unveiled in Toulouse on 18 January 2005, with its first flight on 27 April 2005. It then obtained its type certificate from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on 12 December 2006.\n\nDue to difficulties with the electrical wiring, the initial production was delayed by two years and the development costs almost doubled. It was first delivered to Singapore Airlines on 15 October 2007 and entered service on 25 October. Production peaked at 30 per year in 2012 and 2014. However, after the largest customer, Emirates, reduced its last order in February 2019, Airbus announced that A380 production would end in 2021. On 16 December 2021, Emirates received its 123rd A380, which was the 251st and last delivered by Airbus. The $25 billion investment was not recouped.\n\nThe full-length double-deck aircraft has a typical seating for 525 passengers, with a maximum certified capacity for 853 passengers. The quadjet is powered by Engine Alliance GP7200 or Rolls-Royce Trent 900 turbofans providing a range of 8,000 nmi (14,800 km). As of December 2021, the global A380 fleet had completed more than 800,000 flights over 7.3 million block hours with no fatalities and no hull losses. As of December 2022, there were 237 aircraft in service with 16 operators worldwide.\n\nAnswer:\n\nA380 is the largest passenger airliner.

    "Context:\n\nChinese cuisine encompasses the numerous cuisines originating from China, as well as overseas cuisines created by the Chinese diaspora. Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia and beyond, with modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples such as rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea, chili oil, and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be found worldwide.\n\nThe preferences for seasoning and cooking techniques of Chinese provinces depend on differences in social class, religion, historical background, and ethnic groups. Geographic features including mountains, rivers, forests, and deserts also have a strong effect on the local available ingredients, considering that the climate of China varies from tropical in the south to subarctic in the northeast. Imperial royal and noble preference also plays a role in the change of Chinese cuisine. Because of imperial expansion and trading, ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures have been integrated into Chinese cuisines over time.\n\nThere are numerous regional, religious, and ethnic styles of Chinese cuisine found within China and abroad. Chinese cuisine is highly diverse and most frequently categorized into provincial divisions, although these province-level classifications consist of many more styles within themselves. The most praised Four Great Traditions in Chinese cuisine are Chuan, Lu, Yue, and Huaiyang, representing cuisines of West, North, South, and East China, respectively.

    "Instruction:\n\nGiven a reference text about Conus episcopatus, describe the shell.Context:\n\nConus episcopatus common name the dignified cone, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.\n\nLike all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.\n\nDescription\nThe size of the shell varies between 40 mm and 115 mm. The shell of Conus Episcopatus is elongated and has a high spire, which means that it has a tall apex. The shell is relatively thick and heavy, with a glossy surface and a series of raised ridges or ribs that run along its length. The overall shape of the shell is conical, with a pointed apex and a wider base.\n\nThe coloration of the shell can vary widely, but it basically has a base color of white or cream, with a series of darker or lighter bands, blotches, or spots that form complex patterns. The patterns can be quite intricate and unique, which is one reason why cone snails are prized by collectors.\n\nLike all cone snails, Conus Episcopatus is venomous and uses its venom to immobilize and kill its prey. Venom is delivered through a harpoon-like structure called a radula tooth located on the proboscis of the snail. The venom of some species of cone snail can be highly toxic and dangerous to humans, and care must be taken when handling them.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe shell size ranges from 40mm to 115mm and has a base color of white or cream with series of darker or lighter blotches that form complex patterns.\n\n",

Jessop is most well known for having survived the sinking of both the RMS Titanic in 1912 and her sister ship the HMHS Britannic in 1916, as well as having been onboard the eldest of the three sister ships, the RMS Olympic, when it collided with the British warship HMS Hawke in 1911.\n\nAnswer:\n\n2.\n\n",
    "Context:\n\nSUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [24M] with my girlfriend [26F] of almost 1yr, wondering how to respond to some provocative statements on her part.\nPOST: Backstory: \n\nBasically, my SO of almost 1yr has been rocking the boat this past month. She's thrown a number of my concerns about the relationship back in my face. Things were calm for two weeks, but, last night a number of issues resurfaced.\n\nMy heater went out at my apt (and its cold outside), so I asked my SO if I could stay with her, something I've done fairly regularly up until the past few weeks. She didn't seem to like the idea, and got rather hostile with me when I arrived. I called her on her attitude, and she said a number of pretty strange things. She said my staying over was a disruption in her schedule, that she normally didn't date during the semester, and that she wasn't sure if she is even built to be in a relationship. With regard to my nervousness and uncertainty about the relationship, she said she needed someone who could be certain. It was pretty late, so I asked her if we could talk in the morning. I told her I liked her, and that she's a pretty cool girl. She said I \"was a really nice guy,\" then shut her bedroom door and went to bed.\n\nNeedless to say, I didn't sleep much. I left pretty early in the morning, wondering what to do about her comments. Everything she's said and done seems to indicate she doesn't want to date me, but she hasn't taken any of our heated conversations as opportunities to break up with me. I've been pretty nervous this past month; I only get to see her about once a week for an evening, and she happily fills the rest of her time with her friends. She says she needs someone who can be certain about our relationship, but her actions leave me anything but certain. She's not physically or emotionally intimate with me anymore, and resists any of my requests for more time with her. She flirts with her [30M] officemate on a regular basis, and spends a great deal of her time with him.\n\nWhy won't she just break up with me, if that's what she wants? Is this relationship salvageable? If so, what should I do?\n\nPrompt:\n\nTL;DR\n\nResponse:\n\nSO is indicating with her actions/comments she doesn't want to date me anymore, but won't just break up with me. Is this relationship salvageable? What should I do/say?\n\n",

    "Context:\n\nMultiomics, multi-omics, integrative omics, \"panomics\" or \"pan-omics\" is a biological analysis approach in which the data sets are multiple \"omes\", such as the genome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome, metabolome, and microbiome (i.e., a meta-genome and/or meta-transcriptome, depending upon how it is sequenced); in other words, the use of multiple omics technologies to study life in a concerted way. By combining these \"omes\", scientists can analyze complex biological big data to find novel associations between biological entities, pinpoint relevant biomarkers and build elaborate markers of disease and physiology. In doing so, multiomics integrates diverse omics data to find a coherently matching geno-pheno-envirotype relationship or association. The OmicTools service lists more than 99 softwares related to multiomic data analysis, as well as more than 99 databases on the topic.\n\nSystems biology approaches are often based upon the use of panomic analysis data. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) defines panomics as referring to \"the interaction of all biological functions within a cell and with other body functions, combining data collected by targeted tests ... and global assays (such as genome sequencing) with other patient-specific information.\"\n\nSingle-cell multiomics\nA branch of the field of multiomics is the analysis of multilevel single-cell data, called single-cell multiomics. This approach gives us an unprecedent resolution to look at multilevel transitions in health and disease at the single cell level. An advantage in relation to bulk analysis is to mitigate confounding factors derived from cell to cell variation, allowing the uncovering of heterogeneous tissue architectures.\n\nMethods for parallel single-cell genomic and transcriptomic analysis can be based on simultaneous amplification or physical separation of RNA and genomic DNA. They allow insights that cannot be gathered solely from transcriptomic analysis, as RNA data do not contain non-coding genomic regions and information regarding copy-number variation, for example. An extension of this methodology is the integration of single-cell transcriptomes to single-cell methylomes, combining single-cell bisulfite sequencing to single cell RNA-Seq. Other techniques to query the epigenome, as single-cell ATAC-Seq and single-cell Hi-C also exist.\n\nA different, but related, challenge is the integration of proteomic and transcriptomic data. One approach to perform such measurement is to physically separate single-cell lysates in two, processing half for RNA, and half for proteins. The protein content of lysates can be measured by proximity extension assays (PEA), for example, which use DNA-barcoded antibodies. A different approach uses a combination of heavy-metal RNA probes and protein antibodies to adapt mass cytometry for multiomic analysis.\n\nMultiomics and machine learning\nIn parallel to the advances in highthroughput biology, machine learning applications to biomedical data analysis are flourishing. The integration of multi-omics data analysis and machine learning has led to the discovery of new biomarkers. For example, one of the methods of the mixOmics project implements a method based on sparse Partial Least Squares regression for selection of features (putative biomarkers).\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiomics\n\nInstruction:\n\nGiven these paragraphs about Multiomics, what is panomics?Answer:\n\nThe American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) defines panomics as referring to \"the interaction of all biological functions within a cell and with other body functions, combining data collected by targeted tests ... and global assays (such as genome sequencing) with other patient-specific information.\"\n\n",

    "Instruction:\n\nBased on this paragraph, which two objects account for the majority of the mass of the Solar System?Context:\n\nThe Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. It formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority (99.86%) of the system's mass is in the Sun, with most of the remaining mass contained in the planet Jupiter. The planetary system around the Sun contains eight planets. The four inner system planets\u2014Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars\u2014are terrestrial planets, being composed primarily of rock and metal. The four giant planets of the outer system are substantially larger and more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the next two, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of volatile substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, such as water, ammonia, and methane.

It has an area of 6.7 km2 (2.6 sq mi) and is bordered to the north by Spain. The landscape is dominated by the Rock of Gibraltar, at the foot of which is a densely populated town area, home to over 32,000 people, primarily Gibraltarians.\n\nIn 1704, Anglo-Dutch forces captured Gibraltar from Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession. The territory was ceded to Great Britain in perpetuity under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. It became an important base for the Royal Navy, particularly during the Napoleonic Wars and World War II, as it controlled the narrow entrance and exit to the Mediterranean Sea, the Strait of Gibraltar, which is only 14.3 km (8.9 mi) wide. This choke point remains strategically important, with half the world's seaborne trade passing through it. Gibraltar's economy is based largely on tourism, online gambling, financial services, and bunkering.\n\nThe sovereignty of Gibraltar is a point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations, as Spain asserts a claim to the territory. Gibraltarians overwhelmingly rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty in a 1967 referendum, and for shared sovereignty in a 2002 referendum. Nevertheless, Gibraltar maintains close economic and cultural links with Spain, with many Gibraltarians speaking Spanish as well as a local dialect known as Llanito.\n\nSince Brexit, Gibraltar is not a member of the European Union but negotiations are underway to have it participate in the Schengen Agreement to facilitate border movements between Gibraltar and Spain. As of March 2023, talks seem deadlocked.\n\nName\nThe name is derived from Arabic: \u062c\u0628\u0644 \u0637\u0627\u0631\u0642, romanized: Jabal \u1e6c\u0101riq, lit.\u2009'Mount of Tariq' (named after the 8th-century Moorish military leader Tariq ibn Ziyad).\n\nInstruction:\n\nWhere does the name Gibraltar come from?Answer:\n\nThe name comes from the arabic meaning the mountain of Tarik\n\n",

    "Context:\n\nObserver bias is one of the types of detection bias and is defined as any kind of systematic divergence from accurate facts during observation and the recording of data and information in studies. The definition can be further expanded upon to include the systematic difference between what is observed due to variation in observers, and what the true value is.\n\nObserver bias is the tendency of observers to not see what is there, but instead to see what they expect or want to see. This is a common occurrence in the everyday lives of many and is a significant problem that is sometimes encountered in scientific research and studies. Observation is critical to scientific research and activity, and as such, observer bias may be as well. When such biases exist, scientific studies can result in an over- or underestimation of what is true and accurate, which compromises the validity of the findings and results of the study, even if all other designs and procedures in the study were appropriate.\n\nObservational data forms the foundation of a significant body of knowledge. Observation is a method of data collection and falls into the category of qualitative research techniques. There are a number of benefits of observation, including its simplicity as a data collection method and its usefulness for hypotheses. Simultaneously, there are many limitations and disadvantages in the observation process, including the potential lack of reliability, poor validity, and faulty perception. Participants\u2019 observations are widely used in sociological and anthropological studies, while systematic observation is used where researchers need to collect data without participants direct interactions. The most common observation method is naturalistic observation, where subjects are observed in their natural environments with the goal to assess the behaviour in an intervention free and natural setting.\n\nObserver bias is especially probable when the investigator or researcher has vested interests in the outcome of the research or has strong preconceptions. Coupled with ambiguous underlying data and a subjective scoring method, these three factors contribute heavily to the incidence of observer bias.\n\nExamples of cognitive biases include:\n\nAnchoring \u2013 a cognitive bias that causes humans to place too much reliance on the initial pieces of information they are provided with for a topic. This causes a skew in judgement and prevents humans and observers from updating their plans and predictions as appropriate.\nBandwagon effect \u2013 the tendency for people to \u201cjump on the bandwagon\u201d with certain behaviours and attitudes, meaning that they adopt particular ways of doings things based on what others are doing.\nBias blind spot \u2013 the tendency for people to recognize the impact of bias on others and their judgements, while simultaneously failing to acknowledge and recognize the impact that their own biases have on their own judgement.\nConfirmation bias \u2013 the tendency for people to look for, interpret, and recall information in such a way that their preconceived beliefs and values are affirmed.\nGuilt and innocence by association bias \u2013 the tendency for people to hold an assumption that individuals within a group share similar characteristics and behaviours, including those that would hail them as innocent or guilty.\nHalo effect \u2013 the tendency for the positive impressions and beliefs in one area around a person, brand, company, product or the like to influence an observers opinions or feelings in other unrelated areas.\nFraming effect \u2013 the tendency for people to form conclusions and opinions based on whether the pertinent relevant is provided to them with positive or negative connotations.\nRecency effect \u2013 the tendency for more recent pieces of information, ideas, or arguments to be remembered more clearly than those that preceded.\n\nInstruction:\n\nWhat is observer biasAnswer:\n\nObserver bias is one of the types of detection bias and is defined as any kind of systematic divergence from accurate facts during observation and the recording of data and information in studies. The definition can be further expanded upon to include the systematic difference between what is observed due to variation in observers, and what the true value is.\n\nObserver bias is the tendency of observers to not see what is there, but instead to see what they expect or want to see. This is a common occurrence in the everyday lives of many and is a significant problem that is sometimes encountered in scientific research and studies. Observation is critical to scientific research and activity, and as such, observer bias may be as well. When such biases exist, scientific studies can result in an over- or underestimation of what is true and accurate, which compromises the validity of the findings and results of the study, even if all other designs and procedures in the study were appropriate.\n\nObservational data forms the foundation of a significant body of knowledge. Observation is a method of data collection and falls into the category of qualitative research techniques. There are a number of benefits of observation, including its simplicity as a data collection method and its usefulness for hypotheses. Simultaneously, there are many limitations and disadvantages in the observation process, including the potential lack of reliability, poor validity, and faulty perception. Participants\u2019 observations are widely used in sociological and anthropological studies, while systematic observation is used where researchers need to collect data without participants direct interactions. The most common observation method is naturalistic observation, where subjects are observed in their natural environments with the goal to assess the behaviour in an intervention free and natural setting.\n\nObserver bias is especially probable when the investigator or researcher has vested interests in the outcome of the research or has strong preconceptions. Coupled with ambiguous underlying data and a subjective scoring method, these three factors contribute heavily to the incidence of observer bias.\n\nExamples of cognitive biases include:\n\nAnchoring \u2013 a cognitive bias that causes humans to place too much reliance on the initial pieces of information they are provided with for a topic.

    "Context:\n\nThe Luftwaffe was the aerial-warfare branch of the German Wehrmacht before and during World War II. Germany's military air arms during World War I, the Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte of the Imperial Army and the Marine-Fliegerabteilung of the Imperial Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 in accordance with the terms of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles which banned Germany from having any air force.\n\nDuring the interwar period, German pilots were trained secretly in violation of the treaty at Lipetsk Air Base in the Soviet Union. With the rise of the Nazi Party and the repudiation of the Versailles Treaty, the Luftwaffe's existence was publicly acknowledged on 26 February 1935, just over two weeks before open defiance of the Versailles Treaty through German rearmament and conscription would be announced on 16 March. The Condor Legion, a Luftwaffe detachment sent to aid Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War, provided the force with a valuable testing ground for new tactics and aircraft. Partially as a result of this combat experience, the Luftwaffe had become one of the most sophisticated, technologically advanced, and battle-experienced air forces in the world when World War II broke out in September 1939. By the summer of 1939, the Luftwaffe had twenty-eight Geschwader (wings). The Luftwaffe also operated a paratrooper force known as the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger.\n\nThe Luftwaffe proved instrumental in the German victories across Poland and Western Europe in 1939 and 1940. During the Battle of Britain, however, despite inflicting severe damage to the RAF's infrastructure and, during the subsequent Blitz, devastating many British cities, the German air force failed to batter the beleaguered British into submission. From 1942, Allied bombing campaigns gradually destroyed the Luftwaffe's fighter arm. From late 1942, the Luftwaffe used its surplus ground support and other personnel to raise Luftwaffe Field Divisions. In addition to its service in the West, the Luftwaffe operated over the Soviet Union, North Africa and Southern Europe. Despite its belated use of advanced turbojet and rocket-propelled aircraft for the destruction of Allied bombers, the Luftwaffe was overwhelmed by the Allies' superior numbers and improved tactics, and a lack of trained pilots and aviation fuel. In January 1945, during the closing stages of the Battle of the Bulge, the Luftwaffe made a last-ditch effort to win air superiority, and met with failure. With rapidly dwindling supplies of petroleum, oil, and lubricants after this campaign, and as part of the entire combined Wehrmacht military forces as a whole, the Luftwaffe ceased to be an effective fighting force.\n\nAfter the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Luftwaffe was disbanded in 1946. During World War II, German pilots claimed roughly 70,000 aerial victories, while over 75,000 Luftwaffe aircraft were destroyed or significantly damaged. Of these, nearly 40,000 were lost entirely. The Luftwaffe had only two commanders-in-chief throughout its history: Hermann G\u00f6ring and later Generalfeldmarschall Robert Ritter von Greim for the last two weeks of the war.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe Luftwaffe was officially active for about 11 years - 1935 to 1946.\n\nInstruction:\n\nGiven the below reference text about Luftwaffe, tell me for how many years was this military organisation active officially in Germany?\n\n",

    "Instruction:\n\nGiven this paragraph about the history of triathlon, what is the earliest known triathlon event.Context:\n\nThe evolution of triathlon as a distinct sport is difficult to trace with precision. Many, including triathlon historian and author Scott Tinley, consider events in early twentieth century France to be the beginnings of triathlon, with many three element multisport events of differing composition appearing, all called by different names. The earliest record for an event was from 1901 in Joinville-le-Pont, Val-de-Marne: it called itself \"Les Trois Sports\" (The Three Sports). It was advertised as an event for \"the sportsmen of the time\" and consisted of a run, a bicycle and a canoe segment. By 19 June 1921, the event in Joinville-le-Pont had become more like a standard triathlon, with the canoe segment being replaced with a swim. According to the newspaper L\u2019Auto, the race consisted of a 3 km (1.9 mi) run, a 12 km (7.5 mi) bike ride and the crossing of the river Marne, all staged consecutively and without a break. Throughout the 1920s other bike, run, and swim events appeared in different cities, such as the \u201cCourse des Trois Sports\u201d in Marseille and \"La Course des D\u00e9brouillards\" in Poissy. These multisport events would continue to slowly spread and grow in popularity: by 1934 \"Les Trois Sports\" was being hosted in the city of La Rochelle, though it consisted of three distinct events, swimming a 200 m (660 ft) channel crossing, a 10 km (6 mi) bike competition around the harbour of La Rochelle and the parc Laleu, and a 1.2 km (0.75 mi) run in the stadium Andr\u00e9-Barbeau. Throughout this growth with new events appearing no unified rules ever existed and as a whole triathlon would remain a minority event on the world stage\n\nAnswer:\n\nTriathlon events have evolved of the years, and its origins are not fully known. Triathlon historians have evidenced multisports events dating back to 1901. In this era \"Les Trois Sports\" did not include the swim as it does in modern day triathlon, but instead included a canoe discipline. As the name suggest, triathlon appears to have first surfaced in the history books in france in the suburbs of paris known as Joinville-le-pont, Val-de-marne.\n\n",

The engine would rev well past 4000 RPM while releasing the break at a stop light/sign. It wasn't until months later that I experienced the same thing, so we brought the car in to the dealer and had them take a look. Fast forward through 11 visits for the same problem, three replacements of the Transmission Control Module, a full on Transmission replacement including the flywheel, and 5 visits having the car held for days, sometimes over a week, and then having it returned with the dealer basically saying \"we couldn't replicate the problem so there is no problem.\" I entered into arbitration with the National Center for Dispute Settlements, and just got a Manufacturer's Response Form from Chrysler which basically says \"you're still driving the car so there's no problem with it.\" The last time the issue occurred, the engine redlined \u2013 hit 7k RPM after releasing the break at a red light, and actually lurched forward and coasted at 5mph to a bus stop that I pulled over to.

    "Instruction:\n\nWhat is the formal definition of a large language model?Context:\n\nThough the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.\n\nThough trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to \"memorize\" a great quantity of facts during training.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe term large language model (LLM) does not have a formal definition.

    "Context:\n\nDeep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.\n\nDeep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks and transformers have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.\n\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems. ANNs have various differences from biological brains. Specifically, artificial neural networks tend to be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analog.\n\nThe adjective \"deep\" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Early work showed that a linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier, but that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can. Deep learning is a modern variation that is concerned with an unbounded number of layers of bounded size, which permits practical application and optimized implementation, while retaining theoretical universality under mild conditions. In deep learning the layers are also permitted to be heterogeneous and to deviate widely from biologically informed connectionist models, for the sake of efficiency, trainability and understandability.\n\nAnswer:\n\nDeep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.\n\nInstruction:\n\nWhat is deep learning?\n\n",
    "Instruction:\n\nBased on the paragraph below, which are the most and least popular National Parks in the US?Context:\n\nThe United States has 63 national parks, which are congressionally designated protected areas operated by the National Park Service, an agency of the Department of the Interior. National parks are designated for their natural beauty, unique geological features, diverse ecosystems, and recreational opportunities, typically \"because of some outstanding scenic feature or natural phenomena.\" While legislatively all units of the National Park System are considered equal with the same mission, national parks are generally larger and more of a destination, and hunting and extractive activities are prohibited. National monuments, on the other hand, are also frequently protected for their historical or archaeological significance. Eight national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below. The 424 units of the National Park System can be broadly referred to as national parks, but most have other formal designations.\n\nThirty states have national parks, as do the territories of American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The state with the most national parks is California with nine, followed by Alaska with eight, Utah with five, and Colorado with four. The largest national park is Wrangell\u2013St. Elias in Alaska: at over 8 million acres (32,375 km2), it is larger than each of the nine smallest states. The next three largest parks are also in Alaska. The smallest park is Gateway Arch National Park, Missouri, at 91 acres (0.37 km2). The total area protected by national parks is approximately 52.2 million acres (211,000 km2), for an average of 829 thousand acres (3,350 km2) but a median of only 208 thousand acres (840 km2).\n\nThe national parks set a visitation record in 2017, with more than 84 million visitors and set a further record in 2018 with a 0.1% increase. Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee has been the most-visited park since 1944, and had over 14 million visitors in 2021. In contrast, only about 7,000 people visited the remote Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve in Alaska in 2021.\n\nAnswer:\n\nIf we use number of visitors as a proxy for popularity then The Great Smoky Mountains National Park with over 14 million visitors in 2021 would rank as the most popular National Park. The least visited National Park is the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. Its lower visitation rate may have more to do with its remoteness than the Park's popularity.\n\n",

A sunburst Diplomat Strat-style guitar was purchased by Vaughan and given to his girlfriend Janna Lapidus to learn to play on. Vaughan used a custom set of uncommonly heavy strings, gauges .013, .015, .019, .028, .038, .058, and tuned a half-step below standard tuning. With these heavy string sizes, it was not uncommon for him to separate his fingernail because of his quick movement along the strings. The owner of an Austin club recalled Vaughan coming into the office between sets to borrow super glue, which he used to keep a fingernail split from widening while he continued to play. The super glue was suggested by Rene Martinez, who was Stevie's guitar technician. Martinez eventually convinced Stevie to change to slightly lighter strings. He preferred a guitar neck with an asymmetrical profile (thicker at the top), which was more comfortable for his thumb-over style of playing. Heavy use of the vibrato bar necessitated frequent replacements; Vaughan often had his roadie, Byron Barr, obtain custom stainless steel bars made by Barr's father. As for his usage of plectrums, Vaughan preferred Fender medium gauge guitar picks, using one of the rounder shoulders of the pick rather than the pointed tip to pluck and strum the strings.\n\nInstruction:\n\nWhat kind of guitar pick did Stevie Ray Vaughan prefer?Answer:\n\nSRV is known to have used Fender's medium gauge picks, but with an interesting quirk - he preferred the rounder edge over the pointy tip, which most players use.\n\n",
    "Context:\n\nReliable counts of speakers of Louisiana French are difficult to obtain as distinct from other varieties of French. However, the vast majority of native residents of Louisiana and east and southeast Texas who speak French are likely speakers of Louisiana French.\n\nIn Louisiana, as of 2010, the population of French speakers was approximately 115,183. These populations were concentrated most heavily in the southern, coastal parishes.\n\nIn Texas, as of 2010, the French-speaking population was 55,773, though many of these were likely immigrants from France and other locations, living in the urban areas. Nevertheless, in the rural eastern/southeastern Texas counties of Orange, Jefferson, Chambers, Newton, Jasper, Tyler, Liberty, and Hardin alone\u2014areas where it can be reasonably presumed that almost all French speakers are Louisiana French speakers\u2014the total French-speaking population was composed of 3,400 individuals. It is likely a substantial portion of the 14,493 speakers in Houston's Harris county are also Louisiana French speakers. With this in mind, a marked decline in the number of French speakers in Texas has been noticed in the last half of the twentieth century. For example, at one point[when?] the French-speaking population of Jefferson County was 24,049 as compared to the mere 1,922 today. Likewise, in Harris County the French-speaking population has shifted from 26,796 to 14,493 individuals.\n\nLouisiana French-speaking populations can also be found in southern Mississippi and Alabama, as well as pockets in other parts of the United States.\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt has generally decreased.  For example, in the second half of the twentieth century, the French-speaking population of Jefferson County was 24,049 as compared to 1,922 today. Similarly, in Harris County the French-speaking population has shifted from 26,796 to 14,493.\n\nInstruction:\n\nGiven this text about speakers of varieties of Louisiana French, has the number of French speakers in Texas increased or decreased since the middle of the twentieth century?\n\n",

    "Context:\n\nMost water vapors found mostly in the ocean returns to it, but winds carry water vapor over land at the same rate as runoff into the sea, about 47 Tt per year whilst evaporation and transpiration happening in land masses also contribute another 72 Tt per year. Precipitation, at a rate of 119 Tt per year over land, has several forms: most commonly rain, snow, and hail, with some contribution from fog and dew. Dew is small drops of water that are condensed when a high density of water vapor meets a cool surface.

I know in terms of most long distance relationships, 2 months is hardly anything, but for some reason it's tough for me. The first couple weeks were completely fine for me though. I thought this whole thing would be a breeze, but it's been getting harder. It doesn't help that she hardly has any time to talk, and even when she does neither of us has too much to say. We usually have a 15-20 minute phone call every couple of days. Maybe that's fine and normal. I don't know. But this whole thing has really been weighing on me recently and I'm not sure what to do.\n\nTo add to that, there were some issues in our relationship that we weren't able to completely deal with before she left. These are things that I'm really worried may cause our relationship to end at some point in the future, like emotional unavailability on her part and a general feeling of lacking intimacy. So now I'm left thinking about a lot of those things and knowing I can't properly deal with them until she's back.

    "Context:\n\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the most common methods to determine the physical and chemical properties of atoms by detecting the radio frequency absorbed and subsequent relaxation of nuclei in a magnetic field. This is one of the most commonly used characterisation techniques and has applications in numerous fields. Primarily, the strong magnetic fields are generated by supercooling electromagnets, although there are spectrometers that do not require cryogens. In traditional superconducting solenoids, liquid helium is used to cool the inner coils because it has a boiling point of around 4 K at ambient pressure. Cheap metallic superconductors can be used for the coil wiring. So-called high-temperature superconducting compounds can be made to super conduct with the use of liquid nitrogen, which boils at around 77 K.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a complex application of NMR where the geometry of the resonances is deconvoluted and used to image objects by detecting the relaxation of protons that have been perturbed by a radio-frequency pulse in the strong magnetic field. This is most commonly used in health applications.\nIn large cities, it is difficult to transmit power by overhead cables, so underground cables are used. But underground cables get heated and the resistance of the wire increases, leading to waste of power. Superconductors could be used to increase power throughput, although they would require cryogenic liquids such as nitrogen or helium to cool special alloy-containing cables to increase power transmission. Several feasibility studies have been performed and the field is the subject of an agreement within the International Energy Agency.\n\nCryogenic gases delivery truck at a supermarket, Ypsilanti, Michigan\nCryogenic gases are used in transportation and storage of large masses of frozen food. When very large quantities of food must be transported to regions like war zones, earthquake hit regions, etc., they must be stored for a long time, so cryogenic food freezing is used. Cryogenic food freezing is also helpful for large scale food processing industries.\nMany infrared (forward looking infrared) cameras require their detectors to be cryogenically cooled.\nCertain rare blood groups are stored at low temperatures, such as \u2212165 \u00b0C, at blood banks.\nCryogenics technology using liquid nitrogen and CO2 has been built into nightclub effect systems to create a chilling effect and white fog that can be illuminated with colored lights.\nCryogenic cooling is used to cool the tool tip at the time of machining in manufacturing process. It increases the tool life. Oxygen is used to perform several important functions in the steel manufacturing process.\nMany rockets use cryogenic gases as propellants. These include liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen, and liquid methane.\nBy freezing the automobile or truck tire in liquid nitrogen, the rubber is made brittle and can be crushed into small particles. These particles can be used again for other items.\nExperimental research on certain physics phenomena, such as spintronics and magnetotransport properties, requires cryogenic temperatures for the effects to be observed.\nCertain vaccines must be stored at cryogenic temperatures.

    "Context:\n\nApple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977. The company's second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement. By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.\n\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as \"Wintel\"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the \"Think different\" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\n\nAnswer:\n\nSteve Jobs launched multiple products such as the iPod and iPhone, opened the Apple Store retail chain, and performed numerous acquisitions to bring Apple back to profitability.\n\nInstruction:\n\nGiven a reference text about Apple, what tactics did Steve Jobs use to help the company recover?\n\n",

    "Context:\n\nThe United States has 63 national parks, which are congressionally designated protected areas operated by the National Park Service, an agency of the Department of the Interior. National parks are designated for their natural beauty, unique geological features, diverse ecosystems, and recreational opportunities, typically \"because of some outstanding scenic feature or natural phenomena.\" While legislatively all units of the National Park System are considered equal with the same mission, national parks are generally larger and more of a destination, and hunting and extractive activities are prohibited. National monuments, on the other hand, are also frequently protected for their historical or archaeological significance. Eight national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below. The 424 units of the National Park System can be broadly referred to as national parks, but most have other formal designations.\n\nThirty states have national parks, as do the territories of American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The state with the most national parks is California with nine, followed by Alaska with eight, Utah with five, and Colorado with four. The largest national park is Wrangell\u2013St. Elias in Alaska: at over 8 million acres (32,375 km2), it is larger than each of the nine smallest states. The next three largest parks are also in Alaska. The smallest park is Gateway Arch National Park, Missouri, at 91 acres (0.37 km2). The total area protected by national parks is approximately 52.2 million acres (211,000 km2), for an average of 829 thousand acres (3,350 km2) but a median of only 208 thousand acres (840 km2).\n\nThe national parks set a visitation record in 2017, with more than 84 million visitors and set a further record in 2018 with a 0.1% increase. Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee has been the most-visited park since 1944, and had over 14 million visitors in 2021. In contrast, only about 7,000 people visited the remote Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve in Alaska in 2021.\n\nInstruction:\n\nBased on the paragraph below, which are the most and least popular National Parks in the US?Answer:\n\nIf we use number of visitors as a proxy for popularity then The Great Smoky Mountains National Park with over 14 million visitors in 2021 would rank as the most popular National Park. The least visited National Park is the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. Its lower visitation rate may have more to do with its remoteness than the Park's popularity.\n\n",

    "Instruction:\n\nWhat is observer biasContext:\n\nObserver bias is one of the types of detection bias and is defined as any kind of systematic divergence from accurate facts during observation and the recording of data and information in studies. The definition can be further expanded upon to include the systematic difference between what is observed due to variation in observers, and what the true value is.\n\nObserver bias is the tendency of observers to not see what is there, but instead to see what they expect or want to see. This is a common occurrence in the everyday lives of many and is a significant problem that is sometimes encountered in scientific research and studies. Observation is critical to scientific research and activity, and as such, observer bias may be as well. When such biases exist, scientific studies can result in an over- or underestimation of what is true and accurate, which compromises the validity of the findings and results of the study, even if all other designs and procedures in the study were appropriate.\n\nObservational data forms the foundation of a significant body of knowledge. Observation is a method of data collection and falls into the category of qualitative research techniques. There are a number of benefits of observation, including its simplicity as a data collection method and its usefulness for hypotheses. Simultaneously, there are many limitations and disadvantages in the observation process, including the potential lack of reliability, poor validity, and faulty perception. Participants\u2019 observations are widely used in sociological and anthropological studies, while systematic observation is used where researchers need to collect data without participants direct interactions. The most common observation method is naturalistic observation, where subjects are observed in their natural environments with the goal to assess the behaviour in an intervention free and natural setting.\n\nObserver bias is especially probable when the investigator or researcher has vested interests in the outcome of the research or has strong preconceptions. Coupled with ambiguous underlying data and a subjective scoring method, these three factors contribute heavily to the incidence of observer bias.\n\nExamples of cognitive biases include:\n\nAnchoring \u2013 a cognitive bias that causes humans to place too much reliance on the initial pieces of information they are provided with for a topic. This causes a skew in judgement and prevents humans and observers from updating their plans and predictions as appropriate.\nBandwagon effect \u2013 the tendency for people to \u201cjump on the bandwagon\u201d with certain behaviours and attitudes, meaning that they adopt particular ways of doings things based on what others are doing.\nBias blind spot \u2013 the tendency for people to recognize the impact of bias on others and their judgements, while simultaneously failing to acknowledge and recognize the impact that their own biases have on their own judgement.\nConfirmation bias \u2013 the tendency for people to look for, interpret, and recall information in such a way that their preconceived beliefs and values are affirmed.\nGuilt and innocence by association bias \u2013 the tendency for people to hold an assumption that individuals within a group share similar characteristics and behaviours, including those that would hail them as innocent or guilty.\nHalo effect \u2013 the tendency for the positive impressions and beliefs in one area around a person, brand, company, product or the like to influence an observers opinions or feelings in other unrelated areas.\nFraming effect \u2013 the tendency for people to form conclusions and opinions based on whether the pertinent relevant is provided to them with positive or negative connotations.\nRecency effect \u2013 the tendency for more recent pieces of information, ideas, or arguments to be remembered more clearly than those that preceded.\n\nAnswer:\n\nObserver bias is one of the types of detection bias and is defined as any kind of systematic divergence from accurate facts during observation and the recording of data and information in studies. The definition can be further expanded upon to include the systematic difference between what is observed due to variation in observers, and what the true value is.\n\nObserver bias is the tendency of observers to not see what is there, but instead to see what they expect or want to see. This is a common occurrence in the everyday lives of many and is a significant problem that is sometimes encountered in scientific research and studies. Observation is critical to scientific research and activity, and as such, observer bias may be as well. When such biases exist, scientific studies can result in an over- or underestimation of what is true and accurate, which compromises the validity of the findings and results of the study, even if all other designs and procedures in the study were appropriate.\n\nObservational data forms the foundation of a significant body of knowledge. Observation is a method of data collection and falls into the category of qualitative research techniques. There are a number of benefits of observation, including its simplicity as a data collection method and its usefulness for hypotheses. Simultaneously, there are many limitations and disadvantages in the observation process, including the potential lack of reliability, poor validity, and faulty perception. Participants\u2019 observations are widely used in sociological and anthropological studies, while systematic observation is used where researchers need to collect data without participants direct interactions. The most common observation method is naturalistic observation, where subjects are observed in their natural environments with the goal to assess the behaviour in an intervention free and natural setting.\n\nObserver bias is especially probable when the investigator or researcher has vested interests in the outcome of the research or has strong preconceptions. Coupled with ambiguous underlying data and a subjective scoring method, these three factors contribute heavily to the incidence of observer bias.\n\nExamples of cognitive biases include:\n\nAnchoring \u2013 a cognitive bias that causes humans to place too much reliance on the initial pieces of information they are provided with for a topic. This causes a skew in judgement and prevents humans and observers from updating their plans and predictions as appropriate.\n\nBandwagon effect \u2013 the tendency for people to \u201cjump on the bandwagon\u201d with certain behaviours and attitudes, meaning that they adopt particular ways of doings things based on what others are doing.\n\nBias blind spot \u2013 the tendency for people to recognize the impact of bias on others and their judgements, while simultaneously failing to acknowledge and recognize the impact that their own biases have on their own judgement.\n\nConfirmation bias \u2013 the tendency for people to look for, interpret, and recall information in such a way that their preconceived beliefs and values are affirmed.\n\nGuilt and innocence by association bias \u2013 the tendency for people to hold an assumption that individuals within a group share similar characteristics and behaviours, including those that would hail them as innocent or guilty.\n\nHalo effect \u2013 the tendency for the positive impressions and beliefs in one area around a person, brand, company, product or the like to influence an observers opinions or feelings in other unrelated areas.\n\nFraming effect \u2013 the tendency for people to form conclusions and opinions based on whether the pertinent relevant is provided to them with positive or negative connotations.\n\nRecency effect \u2013 the tendency for more recent pieces of information, ideas, or arguments to be remembered more clearly than those that preceded.\n\n",

However, the specific title was not used to address the kings of Egypt by their contemporaries until the New Kingdom's 18th Dynasty, c. 1400 BC. Along with the title Pharaoh for later rulers, there was an Ancient Egyptian royal titulary used by Egyptian kings which remained relatively constant during the course of Ancient Egyptian history, initially featuring a Horus name, a Sedge and Bee (nswt-bjtj) name and a Two Ladies (nbtj) name, with the additional Golden Horus, nomen and prenomen titles being added successively during later dynasties.\n\nAnswer:\n\n1400 BC\n\n",

    "Context:\n\nThe Luftwaffe was the aerial-warfare branch of the German Wehrmacht before and during World War II. Germany's military air arms during World War I, the Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte of the Imperial Army and the Marine-Fliegerabteilung of the Imperial Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 in accordance with the terms of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles which banned Germany from having any air force.\n\nDuring the interwar period, German pilots were trained secretly in violation of the treaty at Lipetsk Air Base in the Soviet Union. With the rise of the Nazi Party and the repudiation of the Versailles Treaty, the Luftwaffe's existence was publicly acknowledged on 26 February 1935, just over two weeks before open defiance of the Versailles Treaty through German rearmament and conscription would be announced on 16 March. The Condor Legion, a Luftwaffe detachment sent to aid Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War, provided the force with a valuable testing ground for new tactics and aircraft. Partially as a result of this combat experience, the Luftwaffe had become one of the most sophisticated, technologically advanced, and battle-experienced air forces in the world when World War II broke out in September 1939. By the summer of 1939, the Luftwaffe had twenty-eight Geschwader (wings). The Luftwaffe also operated a paratrooper force known as the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger.\n\nThe Luftwaffe proved instrumental in the German victories across Poland and Western Europe in 1939 and 1940. During the Battle of Britain, however, despite inflicting severe damage to the RAF's infrastructure and, during the subsequent Blitz, devastating many British cities, the German air force failed to batter the beleaguered British into submission. From 1942, Allied bombing campaigns gradually destroyed the Luftwaffe's fighter arm. From late 1942, the Luftwaffe used its surplus ground support and other personnel to raise Luftwaffe Field Divisions. In addition to its service in the West, the Luftwaffe operated over the Soviet Union, North Africa and Southern Europe. Despite its belated use of advanced turbojet and rocket-propelled aircraft for the destruction of Allied bombers, the Luftwaffe was overwhelmed by the Allies' superior numbers and improved tactics, and a lack of trained pilots and aviation fuel. In January 1945, during the closing stages of the Battle of the Bulge, the Luftwaffe made a last-ditch effort to win air superiority, and met with failure. With rapidly dwindling supplies of petroleum, oil, and lubricants after this campaign, and as part of the entire combined Wehrmacht military forces as a whole, the Luftwaffe ceased to be an effective fighting force.\n\nAfter the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Luftwaffe was disbanded in 1946. During World War II, German pilots claimed roughly 70,000 aerial victories, while over 75,000 Luftwaffe aircraft were destroyed or significantly damaged. Of these, nearly 40,000 were lost entirely. The Luftwaffe had only two commanders-in-chief throughout its history: Hermann G\u00f6ring and later Generalfeldmarschall Robert Ritter von Greim for the last two weeks of the war.\n\nInstruction:\n\nGiven the below reference text about Luftwaffe, tell me for how many years was this military organisation active officially in Germany?Answer:\n\nThe Luftwaffe was officially active for about 11 years - 1935 to 1946.\n\n",
    "Context:\n\nAs of 2021, the power and capacity of the largest individual battery storage power plants is an order of magnitude less than that of the largest pumped storage power plants, the most common form of grid energy storage.

    "Context:\n\nThe ANT catalog (or TAO catalog) is a classified product catalog by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) of which the version written in 2008\u20132009 was published by German news magazine Der Spiegel in December 2013. Forty-nine catalog pages with pictures, diagrams and descriptions of espionage devices and spying software were published. The items are available to the Tailored Access Operations unit and are mostly targeted at products from US companies such as Apple, Cisco and Dell. The source is believed to be someone different than Edward Snowden, who is largely responsible for the global surveillance disclosures since 2013. Companies whose products could be compromised have denied any collaboration with the NSA in developing these capabilities. In 2014, a project was started to implement the capabilities from the ANT catalog as open-source hardware and software.\n\nBackground\nThe Tailored Access Operations unit has existed since the late 90s. Its mission is to collect intelligence on foreign targets of the United States by hacking into computers and telecommunication networks.\n\nIn 2012, Edward Snowden organized a CryptoParty together with Runa Sandvik, a former colleague of Jacob Appelbaum at The Tor Project. In June 2013, Snowden took internal NSA documents which he shared with Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, resulting in the global surveillance disclosures. It has been speculated for years before that capabilities like those in the ANT catalog existed.\n\nPublication\nJacob Appelbaum co-authored the English publication in Der Spiegel with Christian St\u00f6cker  and Judith Horchert, which was publicized on 29 December 2013. The related English publication on the same day about the TAO by Der Spiegel was also authored by the same people, and including Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach, J\u00f6rg Schindler and Holger Stark. On December 30, Appelbaum gave a lecture about \"the militarization of the Internet\" at the 30th Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg, Germany. At the end of his talk, he encouraged NSA employees to leak more documents.\n\nApple denied the allegations that it collaborated on the development of DROPOUTJEEP in a statement to journalist Arik Hesseldahl from All Things Digital (part of the Wall Street Journal's Digital Network). The Verge questioned how the program developed in later years, since the document was composed in the early period of the iPhone and smartphones in general. Dell denied collaborating with any government in general, including the US government. John Stewart, senior vice president and chief security officer of Cisco stated that they were \"deeply concerned and will continue to pursue all avenues to determine if we need to address any new issues.\" Juniper stated that they were working actively to address any possible exploit paths. Huawei stated they would take appropriate audits to determine if any compromise had taken place and would communicate if that had taken place. NSA declined to comment on the publication by Der Spiegel.\n\nSource\nThe source who leaked the ANT catalog to the press is unknown as of 2023.\n\nAuthor James Bamford, who is specialized in the United States intelligence agencies, noted in a commentary article published by Reuters that Appelbaum has not identified the source who leaked the ANT catalog to him, which led people to mistakenly assume it was Edward Snowden. Bamford got unrestricted access to the documents cache from Edward Snowden and could not find any references to the ANT catalog using automated search tools, thereby concluding that the documents were not leaked by him. Security expert Bruce Schneier has stated on his blog that he also believes the ANT catalog did not come from Snowden, but from a second leaker. Officials at the NSA did not believe that the web crawler used by Snowden touched the ANT catalog and started looking for other people who could have leaked the catalog.\n\nContent\nThe published catalog pages were written between 2008 and 2009.

Most of the surveillance tools can be recreated with off-the-shelf or open-source hardware and software. Thus far, the NSA Playset consists of fourteen items, for which the code and instructions can be found online on the project's homepage. After the initial leak, Michael Ossman, the founder of Great Scott Gadgets, gave a shout out to other security researchers to start working on the tools mentioned in the catalog and to recreate them. The name NSA Playset came originally from Dean Pierce, who is also a contributor (TWILIGHTVEGETABLE(GSM)) to the NSA Playset. Anyone is invited to join and contribute their own device. The requisites for an addition to the NSA Playset is a similar or already existing NSA ANT project, ease of use and a silly name (based on the original tool's name if possible). The silly name requisite is a rule that Michael Ossman himself came up with and an example is given on the project's website: \"For example, if your project is similar to FOXACID, maybe you could call it COYOTEMETH.\" The ease of use part stems also from the NSA Playset's motto: \"If a 10 year old can't do it, it doesn't count!\"\n\nName\tDescription\nTWILIGHTVEGETABLE\ta boot image for GSM communication monitoring.\nLEVITICUS\ta hand held GSM frequency analyzer disguised as a Motorola phone; named after GENESIS.\nDRIZZLECHAIR\ta hard drive with all the needed tools to crack A5/1 including the rainbow tables.\nPORCUPINEMASQUERADE\ta passive Wi-Fi reconnaissance drone.\nKEYSWEEPER\ta keylogger in form of a USB wall charger, that wirelessly and passively sniffs, decrypts, logs and reports back (over GSM).\nSLOTSCREAMER\ta PCI hardware implant, which can access memory and IO.\nADAPTERNOODLE\ta USB exploitation device.\nCHUKWAGON\tuses a pin on a computer's VGA port to attack via the I\u00b2C bus accessing the computer's operating system.\nTURNIPSCHOOL\ta hardware implant concealed in a USB cable which provides short range radio frequency communication capability to software running on the host computer.\nBLINKERCOUGH\ta hardware implant that is embedded in a VGA cable which allows data exfiltration.\nSAVIORBURST\ta hardware implant exploiting the JTAG interface for software application persistence; named after GODSURGE.

She was with someone when things first started happening and then she said she needed time to think about it before ending anything with him. We carried on what we were doing (sleeping together, making love and so on) and now she has moved to another college. At this point she has broke up with him, about a week before leaving and continues to talk to us both. She seems like she has left him. Up until a week ago I thought nothing of this, I truly believed her and then she started talking about how he wanted her back and that she didn't want him. \n\nI thought this was very strange and she seemed like she was hiding something so, I did as the only way I thought I could find out the truth for real. I broke into her Facebook and looked at the messages. I know how terrible it was but it was the only way I could be certain. I know she isn't my girlfriend but I'm great with computers and well... I don't like to be fucked with. I got into it and saw messages from him about how much they missed each other and things like that. I asked her if she loved him still and she straight up said no. Which, is obviously, a lie. \n\nI checked it again this morning as she seemed like she was hiding even more and so when I did it, it had her conversing with him about him wanting her and him sending her (dirty) pictures. She said she sent one back that was \"kinda clean\" (the message said \"sorry it's kinda innocent\"). A little bit later today I asked her if she had anything to tell me since she \"felt bad\" and she said no. I even asked if there is anything I should know and she said the same. \n\nI honestly do think Iove her but another part of me just wants to expose her for who she is.

LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.\n\nThough trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to \"memorize\" a great quantity of facts during training.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe term large language model (LLM) does not have a formal definition.

Precipitation, at a rate of 119 Tt per year over land, has several forms: most commonly rain, snow, and hail, with some contribution from fog and dew. Dew is small drops of water that are condensed when a high density of water vapor meets a cool surface. Dew usually forms in the morning when the temperature is the lowest, just before sunrise and when the temperature of the earth's surface starts to increase. Condensed water in the air may also refract sunlight to produce rainbows.\n\nAnswer:\n\nWater can precipitate in the form of rain, snow, and hail as well as in the form of fog and dew.

It's been over a year since we \"broke up\" (I put that in quotations because it was a long breakup that really ended when we last spoke.) We haven't spoken since June. He was incredibly abusive, I don't even need to get into it, it was ridiculous and pretty bad and hard to get out of it (as you can tell by how long we stayed in contact.) We were together, albeit on and off, but mostly on, for two years. Since our original breakup I've casually dated, with each fling being rather brief...was not looking for anything serious.

    "Instruction:\n\nHave you heard of Doleshwor Mahadeva temple?Context:\n\nDoleshwor Mahadeva (Nepali: \u0921\u094b\u0932\u0947\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0926\u0947\u0935) is a Hindu Temple of Lord Shiva located in Suryabinayak, south eastern part of Bhaktapur District, Nepal, and is believed to be the head part of Kedarnath temple located in Uttarakhand, India.\n\nHistory\nFor 4000 years people have been searching for the head of the Panch Kedar temples, a bull who was Shiva in reality, who assumed the shape of a bull to avoid the five Pandava brothers, the heroes of the Mahabharat. The legend goes back to the fabled battle of Kurukshetra fought between the five Pandava brothers and their cousins, the 100 Kaurava brothers, which is the pivot of the Mahabharata. Many folk legends related to the Garhwal region, Lord Shiva and the creation of the Panch Kedar temples are narrated.\n\nA folk legend about Panch Kedar relates to the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The Pandavas defeated and slayed their cousins \u2014 the Kauravas in the epic Kurukshetra war. They wished to atone for the sins of committing fratricide (gotra hatya) and Br\u0101hmanahatya (killing of Brahmins \u2014 the priest class) during the war. Thus, they handed over the reins of their kingdom to their kin and left in search of lord Shiva and to seek his blessings. First, they went to the holy city of Varanasi (Kashi), believed to be Shiva's favourite city and known for its Kashi Vishwanath Temple. But, Shiva wanted to avoid them as he was deeply incensed by the death and dishonesty at the Kurukshetra war and was, therefore, insensitive to Pandavas' prayers. Therefore, he assumed the form of a bull (Nandi) and hid in the Garhwal region.\n\nNot finding Shiva in Varanasi, the Pandavas went to Garhwal Himalayas. Bhima, the second of the five Pandava brothers, then standing astride two mountains started to look for Shiva. He saw a bull grazing near Guptakashi (\u201chidden Kashi\u201d \u2014 the name derived from the hiding act of Shiva). Bhima immediately recognized the bull to be Shiva. Bhima caught hold of the bull by its tail and hind legs. But the bull-formed Shiva disappeared into the ground to later reappear in parts, with the hump raising in Kedarnath, the arms appearing in Tungnath, the face showing up at Rudranath, the nabhi (navel) and stomach surfacing in Madhyamaheshwar and the hair appearing in Kalpeshwar. The Pandavas pleased with this reappearance in five different forms, built temples at the five places for venerating and worshipping Shiva. The Pandavas were thus freed from their sins. It is also believed that the fore portions of Shiva appeared at Doleshwor Mahadeva Temple, Bhaktapur district Nepal.\n\nA variant of the tale credits Bhima of not only catching the bull, but also stopping it from disappearing. Consequently, the bull was torn asunder into five parts and appeared at five locations in the Kedar Khand of Garhwal region of the Himalayas. After building the Panch Kedar Temples, the Pandavas meditated at Kedarnath for salvation, performed yagna (fire sacrifice) and then through the heavenly path called the Mahapanth (also called Swargarohini), attained heaven or salvation.[citation needed]. The Panch Kedar Temples are constructed in the North-Indian Himalayan Temple architecture with the Kedarnath, Tungnath and Madhyamaheshwar temples looking similar.\n\nAfter completing the pilgrimage of Lord Shiva's darshan at the Panch Kedar Temples, it is an unwritten religious rite to visit Lord Vishnu at the Badrinath Temple, as a final affirmatory proof by the devotee that he has sought blessings of Lord Shiva.\n\nResearch and findings\nThe Hindu activist Bharat Jangam had been researching and claiming that Doleshwar Mahadev is the head part of Kedarnath based on the surprising links between Kedarnath and Doleshwor. The Sculptures of Shive found in both shrines are 4,000 years old. Even a stone scripture found in Doleshwor was written in Sanskrit and Old Nepalese. The priests in both shrines are selected from India's southern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Both priests affix the word \u2018ling\u2019 after their names to convey their proximity to the god as his worshipper and both temples have a cluster of five Shiva shrines. The main deity of both priests is Birbhadra, a companion of Shiva, according to Hindu scriptures. \n\nRecognition\nOn August 22, 2009 the head priest of Kedarnath peeth Shree 1008 Jagat Guru Bheemashankarling Shivacharya unveiled the plaque claiming that Doleswore Mahadev, located in Jangam math Bhaktapur, is the head part of Shri Kedarnath. He performed Rudra Abhishek, a special worshipping at the Doleshwor temple situated in Sipadol village of Bhaktapur district. This is also mentioned in the inscription (Sheela Lekh) at Doleshwar Mahadev. Thousands of devotees have been thronging in the Doleswor Mahadev Temple.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, Doleshwor Mahadeva (Nepali: \u0921\u094b\u0932\u0947\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0926\u0947\u0935) is a Hindu Temple of Lord Shiva located in Suryabinayak, south eastern part of Bhaktapur District, Nepal\n\n",

Bangkok initially served as a customs outpost with forts on both sides of the river, and was the site of a siege in 1688 in which the French were expelled from Siam. After the fall of Ayutthaya to the Burmese in 1767, the newly crowned King Taksin established his capital at the town, which became the base of the Thonburi Kingdom.

I normally wear glasses but didn't have them on that day so my vision was pretty bad.\n\nI excitedly run to the next station at the tennis courts where we're supposed to actually play dodgeball, when I go through the gates one of the mentors yells \"IF YOU CAN DODGE A WRENCH YOU CAN DODGE A BALL\" and whips a four inch long spanner across the tennis court. I hear a pinging noises, and suddenly my head starts to feel warm. The mentor calls out if I'm ok, I say, \"Yep!\" but then lean forward and blood starts to gush from my forehead on to the ground.\n\nEight stitches later and we were decent buds that summer, I think he had to treat me well after that aha.\n\nObviously I can't dodge balls.\n\nPrompt:\n\nTL;DR\n\nResponse:\n\nI got hit in the head with a wrench while dressed as a ferry princess because of the movie \"Dodgeball\".\n\n",

    "Context:\n\nObserver bias is one of the types of detection bias and is defined as any kind of systematic divergence from accurate facts during observation and the recording of data and information in studies. The definition can be further expanded upon to include the systematic difference between what is observed due to variation in observers, and what the true value is.\n\nObserver bias is the tendency of observers to not see what is there, but instead to see what they expect or want to see. This is a common occurrence in the everyday lives of many and is a significant problem that is sometimes encountered in scientific research and studies. Observation is critical to scientific research and activity, and as such, observer bias may be as well. When such biases exist, scientific studies can result in an over- or underestimation of what is true and accurate, which compromises the validity of the findings and results of the study, even if all other designs and procedures in the study were appropriate.\n\nObservational data forms the foundation of a significant body of knowledge. Observation is a method of data collection and falls into the category of qualitative research techniques. There are a number of benefits of observation, including its simplicity as a data collection method and its usefulness for hypotheses. Simultaneously, there are many limitations and disadvantages in the observation process, including the potential lack of reliability, poor validity, and faulty perception. Participants\u2019 observations are widely used in sociological and anthropological studies, while systematic observation is used where researchers need to collect data without participants direct interactions. The most common observation method is naturalistic observation, where subjects are observed in their natural environments with the goal to assess the behaviour in an intervention free and natural setting.\n\nObserver bias is especially probable when the investigator or researcher has vested interests in the outcome of the research or has strong preconceptions. Coupled with ambiguous underlying data and a subjective scoring method, these three factors contribute heavily to the incidence of observer bias.\n\nExamples of cognitive biases include:\n\nAnchoring \u2013 a cognitive bias that causes humans to place too much reliance on the initial pieces of information they are provided with for a topic. This causes a skew in judgement and prevents humans and observers from updating their plans and predictions as appropriate.\nBandwagon effect \u2013 the tendency for people to \u201cjump on the bandwagon\u201d with certain behaviours and attitudes, meaning that they adopt particular ways of doings things based on what others are doing.\nBias blind spot \u2013 the tendency for people to recognize the impact of bias on others and their judgements, while simultaneously failing to acknowledge and recognize the impact that their own biases have on their own judgement.\nConfirmation bias \u2013 the tendency for people to look for, interpret, and recall information in such a way that their preconceived beliefs and values are affirmed.\nGuilt and innocence by association bias \u2013 the tendency for people to hold an assumption that individuals within a group share similar characteristics and behaviours, including those that would hail them as innocent or guilty.\nHalo effect \u2013 the tendency for the positive impressions and beliefs in one area around a person, brand, company, product or the like to influence an observers opinions or feelings in other unrelated areas.\nFraming effect \u2013 the tendency for people to form conclusions and opinions based on whether the pertinent relevant is provided to them with positive or negative connotations.\nRecency effect \u2013 the tendency for more recent pieces of information, ideas, or arguments to be remembered more clearly than those that preceded.\n\nAnswer:\n\nObserver bias is one of the types of detection bias and is defined as any kind of systematic divergence from accurate facts during observation and the recording of data and information in studies.

    "Context:\n\nChinese cuisine encompasses the numerous cuisines originating from China, as well as overseas cuisines created by the Chinese diaspora. Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia and beyond, with modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples such as rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea, chili oil, and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be found worldwide.\n\nThe preferences for seasoning and cooking techniques of Chinese provinces depend on differences in social class, religion, historical background, and ethnic groups. Geographic features including mountains, rivers, forests, and deserts also have a strong effect on the local available ingredients, considering that the climate of China varies from tropical in the south to subarctic in the northeast. Imperial royal and noble preference also plays a role in the change of Chinese cuisine. Because of imperial expansion and trading, ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures have been integrated into Chinese cuisines over time.\n\nThere are numerous regional, religious, and ethnic styles of Chinese cuisine found within China and abroad. Chinese cuisine is highly diverse and most frequently categorized into provincial divisions, although these province-level classifications consist of many more styles within themselves. The most praised Four Great Traditions in Chinese cuisine are Chuan, Lu, Yue, and Huaiyang, representing cuisines of West, North, South, and East China, respectively. The modern Eight Cuisines of China are Anhui (\u5fbd\u83dc; Hu\u012bc\u00e0i), Guangdong (\u7ca4\u83dc; Yu\u00e8c\u00e0i), Fujian (\u95fd\u83dc; M\u01d0nc\u00e0i), Hunan (\u6e58\u83dc; Xi\u0101ngc\u00e0i), Jiangsu (\u82cf\u83dc; S\u016bc\u00e0i), Shandong (\u9c81\u83dc; L\u01d4c\u00e0i), Sichuan (\u5ddd\u83dc; Chu\u0101nc\u00e0i), and Zhejiang (\u6d59\u83dc; Zh\u00e8c\u00e0i) cuisines.\n\n\nA Quanjude cook is slicing Peking roast duck. Peking duck is eaten by rolling pieces of duck with scallion, cucumber and sweet bean sauce using steamed pancakes.\nColor, scent and taste are the three traditional aspects used to describe Chinese food, as well as the meaning, appearance, and nutrition of the food. Cooking should be appraised with respect to the ingredients used, knife work, cooking time, and seasoning.\n\nInstruction:\n\nGiven this paragraph about Chinese cuisine, tell me what are the sub-cuisines, and what made them different.Answer:\n\nThe modern Chinese cuisine were broken down into 8 different styles of local cuisine, which are Anhui, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan , Jiangsu , Shandong, Sichuan, and Zhejiang cuisines. They are different because of many reasons, such as geographic features and climate which shaped the locals to specialize in certain ingredients or flavors, as well as religion and ethnic groups.\n\n",

    "Instruction:\n\nWhat is deep learning?Context:\n\nDeep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.\n\nDeep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks and transformers have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.\n\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems. ANNs have various differences from biological brains. Specifically, artificial neural networks tend to be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analog.\n\nThe adjective \"deep\" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Early work showed that a linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier, but that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can. Deep learning is a modern variation that is concerned with an unbounded number of layers of bounded size, which permits practical application and optimized implementation, while retaining theoretical universality under mild conditions. In deep learning the layers are also permitted to be heterogeneous and to deviate widely from biologically informed connectionist models, for the sake of efficiency, trainability and understandability.\n\nAnswer:\n\nDeep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.\n\n",

    "Context:\n\nThe evolution of triathlon as a distinct sport is difficult to trace with precision. Many, including triathlon historian and author Scott Tinley, consider events in early twentieth century France to be the beginnings of triathlon, with many three element multisport events of differing composition appearing, all called by different names. The earliest record for an event was from 1901 in Joinville-le-Pont, Val-de-Marne: it called itself \"Les Trois Sports\" (The Three Sports). It was advertised as an event for \"the sportsmen of the time\" and consisted of a run, a bicycle and a canoe segment. By 19 June 1921, the event in Joinville-le-Pont had become more like a standard triathlon, with the canoe segment being replaced with a swim. According to the newspaper L\u2019Auto, the race consisted of a 3 km (1.9 mi) run, a 12 km (7.5 mi) bike ride and the crossing of the river Marne, all staged consecutively and without a break. Throughout the 1920s other bike, run, and swim events appeared in different cities, such as the \u201cCourse des Trois Sports\u201d in Marseille and \"La Course des D\u00e9brouillards\" in Poissy. These multisport events would continue to slowly spread and grow in popularity: by 1934 \"Les Trois Sports\" was being hosted in the city of La Rochelle, though it consisted of three distinct events, swimming a 200 m (660 ft) channel crossing, a 10 km (6 mi) bike competition around the harbour of La Rochelle and the parc Laleu, and a 1.2 km (0.75 mi) run in the stadium Andr\u00e9-Barbeau. Throughout this growth with new events appearing no unified rules ever existed and as a whole triathlon would remain a minority event on the world stage\n\nInstruction:\n\nGiven this paragraph about the history of triathlon, what is the earliest known triathlon event.Answer:\n\nTriathlon events have evolved of the years, and its origins are not fully known. Triathlon historians have evidenced multisports events dating back to 1901. In this era \"Les Trois Sports\" did not include the swim as it does in modern day triathlon, but instead included a canoe discipline. As the name suggest, triathlon appears to have first surfaced in the history books in france in the suburbs of paris known as Joinville-le-pont, Val-de-marne.\n\n",

It is an internal conflict between her passion for dance versus her love for me and she constantly questions whether she is doing the right thing (continuing the course). \n\nShe has two good friends that she has made in her course who I feel do not recognize the seriousness of her situation.

First time posting here. \n\nBack story: I am currently twenty years old and have had my license since I was sixteen. I have never been in a collision (with me being responsible or otherwise) and had never been pulled over, arrested, or stopped by an officer in any way until the other night. \n\nSituation: I work at a bar and was leaving work at around 02:15 or so. Initially I was driving on a very well lit road but I got into a darker portion and noticed a car tailgating. Then the blue lights hit and as soon as they turned on, I realized I didn't have my headlights on. I immediately flipped them on and then had a panic attack as I've never been pulled over. So I quickly (within five seconds) pulled over. While pulling over and in my panicked state, I hit the curb. I didn't jump it but definitely gave it a solid love tap. \n\nI immediately rolled down the windows and put my hands on the steering wheel. Officer walked up and I realized that he had probably concluded that I was drunk due to the erratic driving. He asked me questions such as where I was going and where I was coming from etc. I was clearly lucid as I had had nothing to drink or smoke etc. Eventually he took my license and ran it. \n\nI realized that I hadn't turned my lights on (interior) in my panic so I apologized when he returned. I did get a citation for \"lighted headlights/other lights required\" ($119 which strikes me as exorbitant for a first offense). While I do have the ability to pay that, I'd rather not have it on my record if possible. \n\nMy question is what is the likelihood of me going to court and being able to bump this down to a warning. While I'm not thrilled about the prospects of going to court, but if it seems like I have a decent shot, I'd definitely consider. \n\nSecondly, if I did decide to answer the summons, would I have to notify the court of my intent or just show up without having paid the ticket?\n\nPrompt:\n\nTL;DR\n\nResponse:\n\ndrove without headlights, first time ever pulled over, got a ticket.

They can also be oval, spear-shaped, or in many other possible shape variations. The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. A quality of philodendrons is that they do not have a single type of leaf on the same plant. Instead, they have juvenile leaves and adult leaves, which can be drastically different from one another. The leaves of seedling philodendrons are usually heart-shaped early in the life of the plant. But after it has matured past the seedling stage, the leaves will acquire the typical juvenile leaf's shape and size. Later in the philodendron's life, it starts producing adult leaves, a process called metamorphosis. Most philodendrons go through metamorphosis gradually; there is no immediately distinct difference between juvenile and adult leaves. Aside from being typically much bigger than the juvenile leaves, the shape of adult leaves can be significantly different. In fact, considerable taxonomic difficulty has occurred in the past due to these differences, causing juvenile and adult plants to mistakenly be classified as different species.\n\nInstruction:\n\nWhat shape are Philodendron leaves?Answer:\n\nThey are spear-shaped\n\n",

Right after accepting it to see if we have similar friends she messages me to say that her mom is dating a man she thinks might be my father. After a few messages back and forth sure enough it's the real deal. She mentions that he seems like a great guy who really feels like he messaed up in the past and misses his kids terribly. She says she's just trying to help because she lost her father in a divorce years ago and thought I might want to meet him again. The whole reason I haven't seen him in so long is that he was doing lot's of drugs and went apeshit crazy and scared my mom when I was about 13 and when they got divorced he kept violating the restraining order and threatening her. We went into hiding for 4 years after that and lived in a battered and abused women's shelter for a while. Fast forward to now- I am almost 30 years old, a grown married man with a child of my own, with a house and a life. Needless to say, I have no idea what I am getting into. Part of me wants to leave that door closed because I haven't needed him thus far (what if he's still an addict and a total loser.) The other part of me wants an apology, though not excuses, and maybe to see what he has done with the last 15 years. I hesitantly told her I would talk to him on the phone and she's going to give him my number to call me tonight or tomorrow. So what do I do, say, or ask?\n\nPrompt:\n\nTL;DR\n\nResponse:\n\nHaven't seen my dad in 15 years cause he F-ed up his life with drugs and I'm going to talk to him soon. Where do I begin?\n\n",

    "Instruction:\n\nGiven this article about the NSA's ANT catalog, Which hacking tools are used to infect the BIOS of computers or networking devices?Context:\n\nThe ANT catalog (or TAO catalog) is a classified product catalog by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) of which the version written in 2008\u20132009 was published by German news magazine Der Spiegel in December 2013. Forty-nine catalog pages with pictures, diagrams and descriptions of espionage devices and spying software were published. The items are available to the Tailored Access Operations unit and are mostly targeted at products from US companies such as Apple, Cisco and Dell. The source is believed to be someone different than Edward Snowden, who is largely responsible for the global surveillance disclosures since 2013. Companies whose products could be compromised have denied any collaboration with the NSA in developing these capabilities. In 2014, a project was started to implement the capabilities from the ANT catalog as open-source hardware and software.\n\nBackground\nThe Tailored Access Operations unit has existed since the late 90s. Its mission is to collect intelligence on foreign targets of the United States by hacking into computers and telecommunication networks.\n\nIn 2012, Edward Snowden organized a CryptoParty together with Runa Sandvik, a former colleague of Jacob Appelbaum at The Tor Project. In June 2013, Snowden took internal NSA documents which he shared with Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, resulting in the global surveillance disclosures. It has been speculated for years before that capabilities like those in the ANT catalog existed.\n\nPublication\nJacob Appelbaum co-authored the English publication in Der Spiegel with Christian St\u00f6cker  and Judith Horchert, which was publicized on 29 December 2013. The related English publication on the same day about the TAO by Der Spiegel was also authored by the same people, and including Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach, J\u00f6rg Schindler and Holger Stark. On December 30, Appelbaum gave a lecture about \"the militarization of the Internet\" at the 30th Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg, Germany. At the end of his talk, he encouraged NSA employees to leak more documents.\n\nApple denied the allegations that it collaborated on the development of DROPOUTJEEP in a statement to journalist Arik Hesseldahl from All Things Digital (part of the Wall Street Journal's Digital Network). The Verge questioned how the program developed in later years, since the document was composed in the early period of the iPhone and smartphones in general. Dell denied collaborating with any government in general, including the US government. John Stewart, senior vice president and chief security officer of Cisco stated that they were \"deeply concerned and will continue to pursue all avenues to determine if we need to address any new issues.\" Juniper stated that they were working actively to address any possible exploit paths. Huawei stated they would take appropriate audits to determine if any compromise had taken place and would communicate if that had taken place. NSA declined to comment on the publication by Der Spiegel.\n\nSource\nThe source who leaked the ANT catalog to the press is unknown as of 2023.\n\nAuthor James Bamford, who is specialized in the United States intelligence agencies, noted in a commentary article published by Reuters that Appelbaum has not identified the source who leaked the ANT catalog to him, which led people to mistakenly assume it was Edward Snowden. Bamford got unrestricted access to the documents cache from Edward Snowden and could not find any references to the ANT catalog using automated search tools, thereby concluding that the documents were not leaked by him. Security expert Bruce Schneier has stated on his blog that he also believes the ANT catalog did not come from Snowden, but from a second leaker. Officials at the NSA did not believe that the web crawler used by Snowden touched the ANT catalog and started looking for other people who could have leaked the catalog.\n\nContent\nThe published catalog pages were written between 2008 and 2009. The price of the items ranged from free up to $250,000.\n\nCapabilities in the ANT catalog \nPage\tCode name\tDescription\tUnit price in US$\nNSA CANDYGRAM.jpg\tCANDYGRAM\tTripwire device that emulates a GSM cellphone tower.\t40,000\nNSA COTTONMOUTH-I.jpg\tCOTTONMOUTH-I\tFamily of modified USB and Ethernet connectors that can be used to install Trojan horse software and work as wireless bridges, providing covert remote access to the target machine.

Most of the surveillance tools can be recreated with off-the-shelf or open-source hardware and software. Thus far, the NSA Playset consists of fourteen items, for which the code and instructions can be found online on the project's homepage. After the initial leak, Michael Ossman, the founder of Great Scott Gadgets, gave a shout out to other security researchers to start working on the tools mentioned in the catalog and to recreate them. The name NSA Playset came originally from Dean Pierce, who is also a contributor (TWILIGHTVEGETABLE(GSM)) to the NSA Playset. Anyone is invited to join and contribute their own device. The requisites for an addition to the NSA Playset is a similar or already existing NSA ANT project, ease of use and a silly name (based on the original tool's name if possible). The silly name requisite is a rule that Michael Ossman himself came up with and an example is given on the project's website: \"For example, if your project is similar to FOXACID, maybe you could call it COYOTEMETH.\" The ease of use part stems also from the NSA Playset's motto: \"If a 10 year old can't do it, it doesn't count!\"\n\nName\tDescription\nTWILIGHTVEGETABLE\ta boot image for GSM communication monitoring.\nLEVITICUS\ta hand held GSM frequency analyzer disguised as a Motorola phone; named after GENESIS.\nDRIZZLECHAIR\ta hard drive with all the needed tools to crack A5/1 including the rainbow tables.\nPORCUPINEMASQUERADE\ta passive Wi-Fi reconnaissance drone.\nKEYSWEEPER\ta keylogger in form of a USB wall charger, that wirelessly and passively sniffs, decrypts, logs and reports back (over GSM).\nSLOTSCREAMER\ta PCI hardware implant, which can access memory and IO.\nADAPTERNOODLE\ta USB exploitation device.\nCHUKWAGON\tuses a pin on a computer's VGA port to attack via the I\u00b2C bus accessing the computer's operating system.\nTURNIPSCHOOL\ta hardware implant concealed in a USB cable which provides short range radio frequency communication capability to software running on the host computer.\nBLINKERCOUGH\ta hardware implant that is embedded in a VGA cable which allows data exfiltration.\nSAVIORBURST\ta hardware implant exploiting the JTAG interface for software application persistence; named after GODSURGE.

    "Context:\n\nThe evolution of triathlon as a distinct sport is difficult to trace with precision. Many, including triathlon historian and author Scott Tinley, consider events in early twentieth century France to be the beginnings of triathlon, with many three element multisport events of differing composition appearing, all called by different names. The earliest record for an event was from 1901 in Joinville-le-Pont, Val-de-Marne: it called itself \"Les Trois Sports\" (The Three Sports). It was advertised as an event for \"the sportsmen of the time\" and consisted of a run, a bicycle and a canoe segment. By 19 June 1921, the event in Joinville-le-Pont had become more like a standard triathlon, with the canoe segment being replaced with a swim. According to the newspaper L\u2019Auto, the race consisted of a 3 km (1.9 mi) run, a 12 km (7.5 mi) bike ride and the crossing of the river Marne, all staged consecutively and without a break. Throughout the 1920s other bike, run, and swim events appeared in different cities, such as the \u201cCourse des Trois Sports\u201d in Marseille and \"La Course des D\u00e9brouillards\" in Poissy. These multisport events would continue to slowly spread and grow in popularity: by 1934 \"Les Trois Sports\" was being hosted in the city of La Rochelle, though it consisted of three distinct events, swimming a 200 m (660 ft) channel crossing, a 10 km (6 mi) bike competition around the harbour of La Rochelle and the parc Laleu, and a 1.2 km (0.75 mi) run in the stadium Andr\u00e9-Barbeau. Throughout this growth with new events appearing no unified rules ever existed and as a whole triathlon would remain a minority event on the world stage\n\nAnswer:\n\nTriathlon events have evolved of the years, and its origins are not fully known. Triathlon historians have evidenced multisports events dating back to 1901. In this era \"Les Trois Sports\" did not include the swim as it does in modern day triathlon, but instead included a canoe discipline. As the name suggest, triathlon appears to have first surfaced in the history books in france in the suburbs of paris known as Joinville-le-pont, Val-de-marne.\n\nInstruction:\n\nGiven this paragraph about the history of triathlon, what is the earliest known triathlon event.\n\n",

    "Context:\n\nMost modern surfboards are made of fiberglass foam (PU), with one or more wooden strips or \"stringers\", fiberglass cloth, and polyester resin (PE). An emerging board material is epoxy resin and Expanded Polystyrene foam (EPS) which is stronger and lighter than traditional PU/PE construction. Even newer designs incorporate materials such as carbon fiber and variable-flex composites in conjunction with fiberglass and epoxy or polyester resins. Since epoxy/EPS surfboards are generally lighter, they will float better than a traditional PU/PE board of similar size, shape and thickness. This makes them easier to paddle and faster in the water. However, a common complaint of EPS boards is that they do not provide as much feedback as a traditional PU/PE board. For this reason, many advanced surfers prefer that their surfboards be made from traditional materials.\n\nInstruction:\n\nGiven this paragraph about surfboards, summarize what a surfboard is made ofAnswer:\n\nSurfboards can be made out of a variety of materials, but most surfboards these days are made from a foam core that is coated in a hard exterior\n\n",
    "Context:\n\nReliable counts of speakers of Louisiana French are difficult to obtain as distinct from other varieties of French. However, the vast majority of native residents of Louisiana and east and southeast Texas who speak French are likely speakers of Louisiana French.\n\nIn Louisiana, as of 2010, the population of French speakers was approximately 115,183. These populations were concentrated most heavily in the southern, coastal parishes.\n\nIn Texas, as of 2010, the French-speaking population was 55,773, though many of these were likely immigrants from France and other locations, living in the urban areas. Nevertheless, in the rural eastern/southeastern Texas counties of Orange, Jefferson, Chambers, Newton, Jasper, Tyler, Liberty, and Hardin alone\u2014areas where it can be reasonably presumed that almost all French speakers are Louisiana French speakers\u2014the total French-speaking population was composed of 3,400 individuals. It is likely a substantial portion of the 14,493 speakers in Houston's Harris county are also Louisiana French speakers. With this in mind, a marked decline in the number of French speakers in Texas has been noticed in the last half of the twentieth century. For example, at one point[when?] the French-speaking population of Jefferson County was 24,049 as compared to the mere 1,922 today.

It has an area of 6.7 km2 (2.6 sq mi) and is bordered to the north by Spain. The landscape is dominated by the Rock of Gibraltar, at the foot of which is a densely populated town area, home to over 32,000 people, primarily Gibraltarians.\n\nIn 1704, Anglo-Dutch forces captured Gibraltar from Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession. The territory was ceded to Great Britain in perpetuity under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. It became an important base for the Royal Navy, particularly during the Napoleonic Wars and World War II, as it controlled the narrow entrance and exit to the Mediterranean Sea, the Strait of Gibraltar, which is only 14.3 km (8.9 mi) wide. This choke point remains strategically important, with half the world's seaborne trade passing through it. Gibraltar's economy is based largely on tourism, online gambling, financial services, and bunkering.\n\nThe sovereignty of Gibraltar is a point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations, as Spain asserts a claim to the territory. Gibraltarians overwhelmingly rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty in a 1967 referendum, and for shared sovereignty in a 2002 referendum. Nevertheless, Gibraltar maintains close economic and cultural links with Spain, with many Gibraltarians speaking Spanish as well as a local dialect known as Llanito.\n\nSince Brexit, Gibraltar is not a member of the European Union but negotiations are underway to have it participate in the Schengen Agreement to facilitate border movements between Gibraltar and Spain. As of March 2023, talks seem deadlocked.\n\nName\nThe name is derived from Arabic: \u062c\u0628\u0644 \u0637\u0627\u0631\u0642, romanized: Jabal \u1e6c\u0101riq, lit.\u2009'Mount of Tariq' (named after the 8th-century Moorish military leader Tariq ibn Ziyad).\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe name comes from the arabic meaning the mountain of Tarik\n\n",

Magnetism is one aspect of the combined phenomena of electromagnetism. The most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, producing magnetic fields themselves. Demagnetizing a magnet is also possible. Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are iron, cobalt, and nickel and their alloys. The rare-earth metals neodymium and samarium are less common examples. The prefix ferro- refers to iron because permanent magnetism was first observed in lodestone, a form of natural iron ore called magnetite, Fe3O4.\n\nAll substances exhibit some type of magnetism. Magnetic materials are classified according to their bulk susceptibility. Ferromagnetism is responsible for most of the effects of magnetism encountered in everyday life, but there are actually several types of magnetism. Paramagnetic substances, such as aluminium and oxygen, are weakly attracted to an applied magnetic field; diamagnetic substances, such as copper and carbon, are weakly repelled; while antiferromagnetic materials, such as chromium and spin glasses, have a more complex relationship with a magnetic field. The force of a magnet on paramagnetic, diamagnetic, and antiferromagnetic materials is usually too weak to be felt and can be detected only by laboratory instruments, so in everyday life, these substances are often described as non-magnetic.\n\nAnswer:\n\nMagnetism is defined as the physical attributes that are mediated by a magnetic field, which is the capacity to induce attractive and repulsive forces. Magnetic materials are classified by their bulk susceptibility.\n\nInstruction:\n\nGiven a reference text about magnetism, tell me the definition of magnetism and how magnetic materials are classified.\n\n",
    "Instruction:\n\nWhy was Advani concerned about Modi\u2019s appointment as a chief minister of Gujarat?Context:\n\nIn 2001, Keshubhai Patel's health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel's standing had been damaged by his administration's handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001. The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel's administration, was chosen as a replacement. Although Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi's lack of experience in government, Modi declined an offer to be Patel's deputy chief minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee that he was \"going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all\". On 3 October 2001 he replaced Patel as chief minister of Gujarat, with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the December 2002 elections. On 7 October, he was sworn in, and entered the Gujarat state legislature on 24 February 2002 by winning a by-election to the Rajkot \u2013 II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC.\n\nAnswer:\n\nFor Modi being a candidate  for the chief minister of Gujarat, Advani was concerned about Modi\u2019s lack of political experience.\n\n",

    "Context:\n\nThe Wimbledon Championships, commonly known simply as Wimbledon, is the oldest tennis tournament in the world and is widely regarded as the most prestigious. It has been held at the All England Club in Wimbledon, London, since 1877 and is played on outdoor grass courts, with retractable roofs over the two main courts since 2019.\n\nInstruction:\n\nWhat is Wimbledon?Answer:\n\nThe Wimbledon Championships is the oldest tennis tournament in the world. Commonly referred to as Wimbledon, it is one of the four Gran Slam tennis tournaments, alongside the Australian Open, the French Open, and the US Open.\n\n",
    "Instruction:\n\nGiven the below reference text about Luftwaffe, tell me for how many years was this military organisation active officially in Germany?Context:\n\nThe Luftwaffe was the aerial-warfare branch of the German Wehrmacht before and during World War II. Germany's military air arms during World War I, the Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte of the Imperial Army and the Marine-Fliegerabteilung of the Imperial Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 in accordance with the terms of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles which banned Germany from having any air force.\n\nDuring the interwar period, German pilots were trained secretly in violation of the treaty at Lipetsk Air Base in the Soviet Union. With the rise of the Nazi Party and the repudiation of the Versailles Treaty, the Luftwaffe's existence was publicly acknowledged on 26 February 1935, just over two weeks before open defiance of the Versailles Treaty through German rearmament and conscription would be announced on 16 March. The Condor Legion, a Luftwaffe detachment sent to aid Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War, provided the force with a valuable testing ground for new tactics and aircraft. Partially as a result of this combat experience, the Luftwaffe had become one of the most sophisticated, technologically advanced, and battle-experienced air forces in the world when World War II broke out in September 1939. By the summer of 1939, the Luftwaffe had twenty-eight Geschwader (wings). The Luftwaffe also operated a paratrooper force known as the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger.\n\nThe Luftwaffe proved instrumental in the German victories across Poland and Western Europe in 1939 and 1940. During the Battle of Britain, however, despite inflicting severe damage to the RAF's infrastructure and, during the subsequent Blitz, devastating many British cities, the German air force failed to batter the beleaguered British into submission. From 1942, Allied bombing campaigns gradually destroyed the Luftwaffe's fighter arm. From late 1942, the Luftwaffe used its surplus ground support and other personnel to raise Luftwaffe Field Divisions. In addition to its service in the West, the Luftwaffe operated over the Soviet Union, North Africa and Southern Europe. Despite its belated use of advanced turbojet and rocket-propelled aircraft for the destruction of Allied bombers, the Luftwaffe was overwhelmed by the Allies' superior numbers and improved tactics, and a lack of trained pilots and aviation fuel. In January 1945, during the closing stages of the Battle of the Bulge, the Luftwaffe made a last-ditch effort to win air superiority, and met with failure. With rapidly dwindling supplies of petroleum, oil, and lubricants after this campaign, and as part of the entire combined Wehrmacht military forces as a whole, the Luftwaffe ceased to be an effective fighting force.\n\nAfter the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Luftwaffe was disbanded in 1946. During World War II, German pilots claimed roughly 70,000 aerial victories, while over 75,000 Luftwaffe aircraft were destroyed or significantly damaged. Of these, nearly 40,000 were lost entirely. The Luftwaffe had only two commanders-in-chief throughout its history: Hermann G\u00f6ring and later Generalfeldmarschall Robert Ritter von Greim for the last two weeks of the war.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe Luftwaffe was officially active for about 11 years - 1935 to 1946.\n\n"
