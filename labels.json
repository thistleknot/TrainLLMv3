    "Context:\n\nWorld religions is a category used in the study of religion to demarcate the five\u2014and in some cases more\u2014largest and most internationally widespread religious movements. Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are always included in the list, being known as the \"Big Five\". Some scholars also include other world religions, such as Taoism, Jainism, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, and the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, in the category. These are often juxtaposed against other categories, such as indigenous religions and new religious movements, which are also used by scholars in this field of research.\n\nInstruction:\n\nBased on this paragraph about religions of the world, what are the \"big five\" religions?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe \"Big Five\" refers to the five most prominent religious movements globally: Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\n\n",

    "Context:\n\nWagyu \n\nCattle were brought to Japan from China at the same time as the cultivation of rice, in about the second century AD, in the Yayoi period.:\u200a209\u200a Until about the time of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, they were used only as draught animals, in agriculture, forestry, mining and for transport, and as a source of fertilizer. Milk consumption was unknown, and \u2013 for cultural and religious reasons \u2013 meat was not eaten. Cattle were highly prized and valuable, too expensive for a poor farmer to buy.:\u200a2\u200a\n\nJapan was effectively isolated from the rest of the world from 1635 until 1854; there was no possibility of the intromission of foreign genes to the cattle population during this time. Between 1868, the year of the Meiji Restoration, and 1887, some 2600 foreign cattle were imported.:\u200a7\u200a At first, there was little interest in cross-breeding these with the native stock, but from about 1900, it became widespread. It ceased abruptly in 1910 when it was realised that, while the cross-breeds might be larger and have better dairy qualities, their working capacity and meat quality was lower.:\u200a7\u200a From 1919, the various heterogeneous regional populations that resulted from this brief period of cross-breeding were registered and selected as \"Improved Japanese Cattle\". Four separate strains were characterised, based mainly on which type of foreign cattle had most influenced the hybrids, and were recognised as individual breeds in 1944.:\u200a8\u200a They are collectively known as wagy\u016b, and are::\u200a66\u200a:\u200a420\u200a\n\nThe Japanese Black (\u9ed2\u6bdb\u548c\u7a2e, kuroge washu), which constitutes over 90% of beef cattle in Japan; regional strains within the breed include the Tottori, Tajima, Shimane and Okayama.\nThe Japanese Brown or Japanese Red (\u8910\u6bdb\u548c\u7a2e, akage washu or akaushi), the other main breed, representing about 5% of all beef cattle;:\u200a17\u200a reared in southern Japan, in K\u014dchi Prefecture on Shikoku island, and in Kumamoto Prefecture on Kyushu island.:\u200a8\u200a\nThe Japanese Polled (\u7121\u89d2\u548c\u7a2e, mukaku washu), found principally in Yamaguchi Prefecture:\u200a8\u200a\nThe Japanese Shorthorn (\u65e5\u672c\u77ed\u89d2\u548c\u7a2e, nihon tankaku washu), reared in northern Japan, mainly in Iwate Prefecture; it constitutes less than one percent of all wagyu cattle.[\n\nInstruction:\n\nGiven a reference text about Wagyu, tell me the different types of cattle that are together known as wagyu.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe different types of cattle that are known as Wagyu are:\n- The Japanese Black\n- The Japanese Brown\n- The Japanese Polled\n- The Japanese Shorthorn\n\n",
    "Context:\n\nMultiomics, multi-omics, integrative omics, \"panomics\" or \"pan-omics\" is a biological analysis approach in which the data sets are multiple \"omes\", such as the genome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome, metabolome, and microbiome (i.e., a meta-genome and/or meta-transcriptome, depending upon how it is sequenced); in other words, the use of multiple omics technologies to study life in a concerted way. By combining these \"omes\", scientists can analyze complex biological big data to find novel associations between biological entities, pinpoint relevant biomarkers and build elaborate markers of disease and physiology. In doing so, multiomics integrates diverse omics data to find a coherently matching geno-pheno-envirotype relationship or association. The OmicTools service lists more than 99 softwares related to multiomic data analysis, as well as more than 99 databases on the topic.\n\nSystems biology approaches are often based upon the use of panomic analysis data. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) defines panomics as referring to \"the interaction of all biological functions within a cell and with other body functions, combining data collected by targeted tests ... and global assays (such as genome sequencing) with other patient-specific information.\"\n\nSingle-cell multiomics\nA branch of the field of multiomics is the analysis of multilevel single-cell data, called single-cell multiomics. This approach gives us an unprecedent resolution to look at multilevel transitions in health and disease at the single cell level. An advantage in relation to bulk analysis is to mitigate confounding factors derived from cell to cell variation, allowing the uncovering of heterogeneous tissue architectures.\n\nMethods for parallel single-cell genomic and transcriptomic analysis can be based on simultaneous amplification or physical separation of RNA and genomic DNA. They allow insights that cannot be gathered solely from transcriptomic analysis, as RNA data do not contain non-coding genomic regions and information regarding copy-number variation, for example. An extension of this methodology is the integration of single-cell transcriptomes to single-cell methylomes, combining single-cell bisulfite sequencing to single cell RNA-Seq. Other techniques to query the epigenome, as single-cell ATAC-Seq and single-cell Hi-C also exist.\n\nA different, but related, challenge is the integration of proteomic and transcriptomic data. One approach to perform such measurement is to physically separate single-cell lysates in two, processing half for RNA, and half for proteins. The protein content of lysates can be measured by proximity extension assays (PEA), for example, which use DNA-barcoded antibodies. A different approach uses a combination of heavy-metal RNA probes and protein antibodies to adapt mass cytometry for multiomic analysis.\n\nMultiomics and machine learning\nIn parallel to the advances in highthroughput biology, machine learning applications to biomedical data analysis are flourishing. The integration of multi-omics data analysis and machine learning has led to the discovery of new biomarkers. For example, one of the methods of the mixOmics project implements a method based on sparse Partial Least Squares regression for selection of features (putative biomarkers).\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiomics\n\nInstruction:\n\nGiven these paragraphs about Multiomics, what is single-cell multiomics?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe analysis of multilevel single-cell data. This approach gives us an unprecedent resolution to look at multilevel transitions in health and disease at the single cell level.\n\n",

    "Context:\n\nA skipping rope or jump rope is a tool used in the sport of skipping/jump rope where one or more participants jump over a rope swung so that it passes under their feet and over their heads. There are multiple subsets of skipping/jump rope, including single freestyle, single speed, pairs, three-person speed (Double Dutch), and three-person freestyle (Double Dutch freestyle).\n\nRope skipping is commonly performed as an exercise or recreational activity, and there are also several major organizations that support jump rope as a competitive sport. Often separated by sex and age, events include hundreds of competitive teams all around the world. In the US, schools rarely have jump rope teams, and few states have sanctioned official events at the elementary school level. In freestyle events, jumpers use a variety of basic and advanced techniques in a routine of one minute, which is judged by a head judge, content judges, and performance judges. In speed events, a jumper alternates their feet with the rope going around the jumper every time one of their feet hits the ground for 30 seconds, one minute, or three minutes. The jumper is judged on the number of times the right foot touches the ground in those times.\n\nInstruction:\n\nHow to skip rope?\n\nAnswer:\n\nA skipping rope is a fun form of exercise that is enjoyed by children and adults. \nWhile holding on to both ends of the rope, allow the middle of rope to rest on the ground in front of your feet, step over the rope so the rope is now behind your feet. \nSimultaneously, swing both arms over your head in a full swing so the rope is follows the motion of your arms and just before the rope reached the front of your feet, hop with both feet, avoiding the rope and continue the rhythm repeatedly.\n\n",
    "Context:\n\nThe Salt River is a formerly navigable hanging channel of the Eel River which flowed about 9 miles (14 km) from near Fortuna and Waddington, California, to the estuary at the Pacific Ocean, until siltation from logging and agricultural practices essentially closed the channel.
