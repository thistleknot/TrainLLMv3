Since living things have both a formal and a material nature, the soul and body respectively, the psychological and material are both part of the natural, or \u201cphysical.\u201d As required by his metaphysical account of the unity of hylomorphic compounds, the soul and the body are not two numerically distinct things, but rather go together to constitute a composite that is itself an intrinsic unity. On this view, the organic body\u2019s potentiality for life cannot exist without being exercised, and the material body cannot exist without its form, the soul. Since Ackrill (1972/3) raised doubts about the coherence of this kind of account, there has been much lively debate as to how this relates to contemporary philosophy of mind.

    "Context:\n\nInstruction:\n\nWhat makes airplanes fly?\n\nAnswer:\n\nWhen an airplane engine starts, the propeller creates thrust and pulls the airplane forward.  As the airplane moves forward, more and more air moves over the wing.  The airplane wings are designed to be curved over the top and flat across the bottom.  As a result, the air molecules take longer to travel over the top of the wing than they do on the underside.  This creates a differential in air pressure between the top and bottom of the wing.  The difference in air pressure is called Lift.  As thrust increases and pulls the plane forward, the lift eventually increases enough to overcome the weight and drag and the airplane will take flight.",

Anything that can be explained has a cause in his sense. The \u201ccause\u201d of something is an explanatory factor, the grasp of which constitutes knowing why something is the case. There are four different types of cause or explanatory factor. The material cause is that out of which a thing is generated and which persists as a constituent (e.g., the bronze is the material cause of the statue). The formal cause is what is given in the definition of the being of a thing.

I go spend the summer with mom and help around the house... No place to sleep, rooms are filled to the gills with things she finds at yard sales. Clear out a room to sleep and she complains bitterly and endlessly about how \"everything\" has moved. \n\nI start helping her out with chores around the house and she starts bossing me around over the most insignificant of details. I start doing it my own way when she's not looking but this has the risk of creating an aire of distrust at times. Eventually she breaks down and starts getting mean about it. Claiming I just \"barged in\" and \"took over the place\" telling my siblings \"... he just does as he damn well pleases and never consults with ME about anything...\" etc. \n\nShe's fallen down several times and cannot get up without assistance so its a dangerous situation for her to continue on like she is. The sad part about it all is the people who take advantage of her all the time. She hires a maid who steals from her regularly (caught red handed 3x now but mom refuses to press charges and keeps inviting her back to help), or people come into the house and steal things from her freely since she hasn't locked the doors in over 40 years now. The house is a first class wreck at this point as she's a level 3 hoarder. She gets sick (like have to go to the hospital for 2-3 days - THAT kind of sick) from time to time because she eats under-cooked or rotten foods left in the refrigerator for days/weeks, etc.\n\nI've talked with my siblings about taking away her drivers license which would put her in a situation where she would require assistance by force majure but none will endorse it even if I were the one responsible.\n\nPrompt:\n\nsummarize\n\nResponse:\n\nMom doesn't want help, just wants people to boss around.

    "Instruction:\n\nAfter discharging and disconnecting a capacitor, what causes it to develop a voltage?\n\nContext:\n\nCapacitors made with any type of dielectric material will show some level of \"dielectric absorption\" or \"soakage\". On discharging a capacitor and disconnecting it, after a short time it may develop a voltage due to hysteresis in the dielectric. This effect can be objectionable in applications such as precision sample and hold circuits or timing circuits. The level of absorption depends on many factors, from design considerations to charging time, since the absorption is a time-dependent process. However, the primary factor is the type of dielectric material. Capacitors such as tantalum electrolytic or polysulfone film exhibit very high absorption, while polystyrene or Teflon allow very small levels of absorption. In some capacitors where dangerous voltages and energies exist, such as in flashtubes, television sets, and defibrillators, the dielectric absorption can recharge the capacitor to hazardous voltages after it has been shorted or discharged. Any capacitor containing over 10 joules of energy is generally considered hazardous, while 50 joules or higher is potentially lethal. A capacitor may regain anywhere from 0.01 to 20% of its original charge over a period of several minutes, allowing a seemingly safe capacitor to become surprisingly dangerous.\n\nAnswer:\n\nhysteresis in the dielectric\n\n",

The position ascribed to *Protagoras (c. 485-415 B.C.E.) in Plato\u2019s Protagoras (320-8) is that justice and the other virtues are promoted, in any given society, by public and private persuasion and are a necessary precondition of human communities and hence of human survival.

Consequently, Epicurus distinguished between the atom, which was physically unsplittable as a consequence of its material solidity, and the minimum or theoretically indivisible quantity (Letter to Herodotus 58-59). Because the minimum, however small, is finite, it can, unlike a point, serve as a unit of measure of magnitudes. Epicurus agreed with Democritus, as against Plato and Aristotle, that the universe extends infinitely, and consequently the number of atoms and of local worlds is held to be infinite (Letter to Herodotus 45).

These same scholars tend to argue that Socrates refused to respond to any distinctly political accusations against him because he was in fact guilty and had no defense. A number of recent studies have shown, however, that there is no credible evidence that the motivation behind Socrates\u2019 trial was in any sense political. Socrates was apparently surprised by the closeness of the vote to convict him.

Some of these are also known as public schools. Preparatory schools in the UK prepare pupils aged up to 13 years old to enter public schools. The name \"public school\" is based on the fact that the schools were open to pupils from anywhere, and not merely to those from a certain locality, and of any religion or occupation. According to The Good Schools Guide approximately 9 per cent of children being educated in the UK are doing so at fee-paying schools at GSCE level and 13 per cent at A-level.[citation needed] Many independent schools are single-sex (though this is becoming less common).

It started with us having crushes on each other, but we hung out and decided nothing was going to happen. \n\nWe're in the same friend group and one night we were hanging out and stuff happened. This continued for awhile, then he started to ignore me. We randomly hung out maybe a week and a half later and did more stuff. That's been the pattern since then: we hook up, don't talk for awhile, then hook up again. He's always really nice and sweet to me before we hook up, but as soon as it's over he's quiet and leaves quickly. \n\nI've always had a problem with that, but a few days ago we were in the middle of hooking up when he gets up, says he's late for something, and then leaves. The next night I saw him at a party and he avoided eye contact and left immediately.\n\nI tried texting him, but he doesn't answer. This has hurt my feelings quite a bit, and I have no idea what's going on. Should I bother trying to find out what's up? I do care about him as a friend, and I don't want to make things weird for us.

However, depending on the kinds of lives they lead, different people have different conceptions of happiness. Uncultured people typically take it that this good is pleasure (though some of them will identify it with either wealth or honor), whereas persons of refinement and good upbringing tend to conceive of it as either honor (as an end of political action) or perhaps as virtue. Third, there are those who identify the good with the life of theoretical contemplation. However, the good is not, as Plato thought, a separately existing transcendent Form of the Good Itself. It must instead be some humanly achievable good, a good for the sake of which all of our actions are performed. The good that serves as the end of human life is complete in that it is choiceworthy solely for its own sake, and never for the sake of anything else. Happiness is self-sufficient in the sense that taken by itself it makes one\u2019s life choiceworthy and lacking in nothing, and as such it is the most choiceworthy of all goods.

Instead, if it is a genuine branch of knowledge, it must look to something other than observable beds\u2014and the object to which it looks is what Plato calls the Form of bed. Similarly, he would say, to achieve a proper understanding of the natural world, we must not take these many perceivable examples of fire and earth to form the basic objects of our study. Just as a geometer must realize that he is not studying these particular lines in his diagram, but is proving theorems about the nature of triangles, numbers, and equality, so students of the cosmos or the human body should recognize that their ultimate concern is with the Forms of fire, air, and health. This does not mean that they are to pay no attention whatsoever to the observable world; rather, the study of objects that can be sensed is to be pursued to the extent that it serves a higher epistemic goal, the understanding of the Forms.

This is why it is best to have a just soul and to lead a just life: It is a life spent in devotion to and imitation of the best objects there are. And we can see why Plato assumes that a just person will refrain from the sorts of activities that are ordinarily considered unjust. Philosophers, because of their love of the Forms, become lovers of proper order in the sensible world as well. They wish to imitate the harmony of the Forms, and so in their relations with others they are loathe to do anything that violates the proper order among people. Furthermore, the normal incentives of human injustice\u2014lust, avarice, hunger for power, aggressiveness\u2014are absent in those who have been transformed by their love of Forms. Even though Plato in this way maintains a link between perfect justice as a state of the soul and just behavior as ordinarily understood, it should be recognized how far he has moved from the ordinary conception of what just persons are like.

These include mechanical approaches such as using high pressures and low temperatures, or employing chemical compounds that release H2 upon demand. While large amounts of hydrogen are produced by various industries, it is mostly consumed at the site of production, notably for the synthesis of ammonia. For many years hydrogen has been stored as compressed gas or cryogenic liquid, and transported as such in cylinders, tubes, and cryogenic tanks for use in industry or as propellant in space programs. Interest in using hydrogen for on-board storage of energy in zero-emissions vehicles is motivating the development of new methods of storage, more adapted to this new application.
