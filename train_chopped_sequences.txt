Augustine, however, explicitly rejects Plato’s idea that the soul was introduced to the realm of intelligible realities before birth; instead, he espouses innatism. Referring now explicitly to the Socratic interrogation of the slave boy in Plato’s Meno, which was meant to demonstrate that there is latent knowledge of geometry, even among the untutored, Augustine protests that not all would have been geometricians in their previous life, “since there are so few of them in the human race that one can hardly be found.” He goes on: We ought rather to believe that the nature of the intellectual mind is so formed as to see those things which, according to the disposition of the creator, are subjoined to intelligible things in the natural order, in a sort of incorporeal light of its own kind (Trin. 12.15,24).

and when has there been an event more embarrassing to democracy than the one portrayed in the Apology? Where else can we find a more infuriating advocate of censorship? It is part of our self-image that we listen to those who oppose our values, and perhaps for this reason Plato has become an indispensable part of our democratic culture. Furthermore, his gifts as a stylist are evident even in translation; when these literary qualities are combined with the power of his doctrines to provoke an emotional response, his continuing fascination is understandable. But this cannot be the whole story. Modern intellectual life contains many warring factions, and Plato’s dialogues contain many worlds; some of these worlds provide hospitable homes for contemporary forms of Platonism. In the philosophy of mathematics, some of the most influential theoreticians consider themselves to be Platonists and hold that mathematical truths are descriptions of an imperceivable and timeless realm of objects. In metaphysics, the existence of universals remains a live option. In epistemology, Plato’s conception of knowledge as superior to mere belief, because it involves a rational account, still has many

How long has the Brenner Pass been used as a trading route? 

Context:

Crossing the Italian-Austrian border, the Brenner Pass separates the Ötztal Alps and Zillertal Alps and has been in use as a trading route since the 14th century. The lowest of the Alpine passes at 985 m (3,232 ft), the Semmering crosses from Lower Austria to Styria; since the 12th century when a hospice was built there it has seen continuous use. A railroad with a tunnel 1 mile (1.6 km) long was built along the route of the pass in the mid-19th century. With a summit of 2,469 m (8,100 ft), the Great St. Bernard Pass is one of the highest in the Alps, crossing the Italian-Swiss border east of the Pennine Alps along the flanks of Mont Blanc. The pass was used by Napoleon Bonaparte to cross 40,000 troops in 1800. The Saint Gotthard Pass crosses from Central Switzerland to Ticino; in the late 19th century the 14 km (9 mi) long Saint Gotthard Tunnel was built connecting Lucerne in Switzerland, with Milan in Italy. The Mont Cenis pass has been a major commercial road between Western Europe and Italy. Now the pass has been supplanted by the Fréjus Road and Rail tunnel. At 2,756 m (9,042 ft), the Stelvio Pass in northern Italy is one of the highest of the Alpine passes; the road was built in the 1820s. The highest pass in the alps is the col de l'Iseran in Savoy (France) at 2,770 m (9,088 ft).

What did Posidonius compare philosophy to?

Context:

philosophical innovation is reflected in his conception of the structure of *knowledge. Whereas earlier Stoics had seen logic primarily as a means of defending Stoicism against *skeptical attacks, Posidonius, living at a time when skepticism was losing its grip on the Stoa’s adversaries in the *Academy, viewed *logic as an integral part of philosophy. Logic for Posidonius was the rational mechanism whereby conclusions are derived from principles or axioms, therein constituting an aspect of both physics and *ethics. Posidonius compared philosophy to a living organism, likening logic to the skeletal structure by which the flesh and blood of physics is supported, while ethics, like the *soul, animates the whole. Committed to philosophy as a deductive system of scientific knowledge, Posidonius defended the axiomatic method of *Euclid and traditional Greek geometry.

TITLE: 77yo. Mother is annoying and controlling
POST: Mom's health is steadily degrading and she's constantly complaining about the state of affairs, things she can't do anymore, etc. However, she makes it utterly impossible for anyone to help. I go spend the summer with mom and help around the house... No place to sleep, rooms are filled to the gills with things she finds at yard sales. Clear out a room to sleep and she complains bitterly and endlessly about how "everything" has moved. 

I start helping her out with chores around the house and she starts bossing me around over the most insignificant of details. I start doing it my own way when she's not looking but this has the risk of creating an aire of distrust at times. Eventually she breaks down and starts getting mean about it. Claiming I just "barged in" and "took over the place" telling my siblings "... he just does as he damn well pleases and never consults with ME about anything..." etc. 

She's fallen down several times and cannot get up without assistance so its a dangerous situation for her to continue on like she is. The sad part about it all is the people who take advantage of her all the time. She hires a maid who steals from her regularly (caught red handed 3x now but mom refuses to press charges and keeps inviting her back to help), or people come into the house and steal things from her freely since she hasn't locked the doors in over 40 years now. The house is a first class wreck at this point as she's a level 3 hoarder. She gets sick (like have to go to the hospital for 2-3 days - THAT kind of sick) from time to time because she eats under-cooked or rotten foods left in the refrigerator for days/weeks, etc.

What is Plato's attitude towards the study of objects that can be sensed?

Context:

a craft cannot depend on the close observation of those particular beds. Instead, if it is a genuine branch of knowledge, it must look to something other than observable beds—and the object to which it looks is what Plato calls the Form of bed. Similarly, he would say, to achieve a proper understanding of the natural world, we must not take these many perceivable examples of fire and earth to form the basic objects of our study. Just as a geometer must realize that he is not studying these particular lines in his diagram, but is proving theorems about the nature of triangles, numbers, and equality, so students of the cosmos or the human body should recognize that their ultimate concern is with the Forms of fire, air, and health. This does not mean that they are to pay no attention whatsoever to the observable world; rather, the study of objects that can be sensed is to be pursued to the extent that it serves a higher epistemic goal, the understanding of the Forms.

And we can see why Plato assumes that a just person will refrain from the sorts of activities that are ordinarily considered unjust. Philosophers, because of their love of the Forms, become lovers of proper order in the sensible world as well. They wish to imitate the harmony of the Forms, and so in their relations with others they are loathe to do anything that violates the proper order among people. Furthermore, the normal incentives of human injustice—lust, avarice, hunger for power, aggressiveness—are absent in those who have been transformed by their love of Forms. Even though Plato in this way maintains a link between perfect justice as a state of the soul and just behavior as ordinarily understood, it should be recognized how far he has moved from the ordinary conception of what just persons are like.

On the whole, however, the art of words was intended for serious purposes and commanded serious fees.

Ancient sources attest to Plato’s association with some of the leading mathematicians of his time, and we can see from the Republic how important he took mathematical studies to be for the development of philosophical skills and insights. During this period, when Plato was writing the Phaedo, Republic, Symposium, and Phaedrus, there is a burst of confident and highly programmatic theorizing. The nature and eternality of the soul are revealed; grand theories of human motivation are sketched; an ideal city is described; the nature of the virtues is discovered.

The scenery was beautiful: clear blue skies, white puffy clouds, the buds on the trees blossoming. I should mention at this point that I have severe hay fever, so you might be able to tell where this is going. While everything was indeed beautiful, it was quite a shock for my immune system to go from mostly indoors/wintertime to plant sex central, and my eyes started watering and getting itchy. Really, really itchy. I was able to control myself until we got back into the car, because I know that rubbing makes it worse. But once I was out of the pollen-infested air, I allowed myself one rub, one teeensy, little rub, because the itchiness had become intolerable at that point. 
I cannot describe the relief that that first rub brought after hours of monk-like abstention. Unfortunately, as soon as I took my hands away, my eyes starting itching again, this time worse than before. So I rubbed more. Which made them itchier. This horrible cycle continued on the 90-minute drive home, so that by the time we got out of the car, I was keeping my eyes closed with my hands over them, sneezing every couple of seconds. When we got out, and I was forced to open my eyes, my friends burst out laughing. My entire face was swollen, eyes bright red and glossy, and snot was dribbling down my face. I couldn't see, everything was itching and burning, I was having trouble breathing, and I contemplated going to the hospital, all because of plant sperm.

There can be no other explanation of the fact that he made Socrates the principal interlocutor of so many of his dialogues and that he wrote an eloquent defense of him in the Apology.

Third, there are those who identify the good with the life of theoretical contemplation. However, the good is not, as Plato thought, a separately existing transcendent Form of the Good Itself. It must instead be some humanly achievable good, a good for the sake of which all of our actions are performed. The good that serves as the end of human life is complete in that it is choiceworthy solely for its own sake, and never for the sake of anything else.

What are some predators of the electric eel?

Context:

Predatory animals often use their usual methods of attacking prey to inflict or to threaten grievous injury to their own predators. The electric eel uses the same electric current to kill prey and to defend itself against animals (anacondas, caimans, egrets, jaguars, mountain lions, giant otters, humans, dogs, and cats) that ordinarily prey upon fish similar to an electric eel in size; the electric eel thus remains an apex predator in a predator-rich environment. A predator small enough to be prey for others, the domestic cat uses its formidable teeth and claws as weapons against animals that might confuse a cat with easier prey. Many non-predatory prey animals, such as a zebra, can give a strong kick that can maim or kill, while others charge with tusks or horns.

ricists claimed that no such speculation is necessary, or even beneficial, to medicine. Rather, the art advances by accumulating experiences of treatments that have been correlated with the curing of various diseases. These are formulated by the physician in theorems and are passed on as “history” to others. Medicine advances both on the trial-and-error accumulation of such experience and on the deliberate trying of treatments on similar diseases or similar treatments on the same diseases when necessary. The art of medicine is the accumulation of such theorems. As Galen (129-200 C.E.) reports it, this debate was not about how to administer treatment, but over how best to discover new treatments. In An Outline of Empiricism, Galen indicates that the Empiricists depended for their attack on the Rationalists on “skeptical arguments developed by *Pyrrhoneans; and *Sextus Empiricus was both a leading skeptic and a medical practitioner of the Empiricist school.

TITLE: I (25F) used to do some really shitty things while drunk. I really hate myself for it, and don't really know how to move on.
POST: I'll try not to make this too long! Thank you for reading.

I (25F) have always been a very anxious and insecure person. I've been in therapy for it, and can happy say I'm currently at the best place I've ever been. I've been with my boyfriend (25M) two years and we're extremely happy. No cheating, no issues. I haven't been getting as anxious as I would in past relationships and I've really worked on myself. 

However, when I was in college (18-22) i would drink a lot and do some really questionable things. I had a good amount of one night stands which in itself is fine, but I would also do things like hook up with my friend's ex in another friends bed, and even went as far as cheated on SOs on a couple occasions. I regret all of this immensely now. I feel like a horrible person for it. I've done a lot of self reflecting and tried to think of what made me act that way. I really don't handle alcohol well, but that's not an excuse. I constantly needed attention from guys as a way to feel good about myself, and would take that way too far. 

Now that I've "moved on" from that stage of my life (i don't really drink anymore, also for that reason), it's really hard for me to look back, and to think about how my close friends must view me. My BF doesn't really know any of this, he knows I've cheated before and worked on myself, but no details. I guess my question is, how do I stop feeling like a horrible person, and like my close friends must think I'm a horrible person?

Since living things have both a formal and a material nature, the soul and body respectively, the psychological and material are both part of the natural, or “physical.” As required by his metaphysical account of the unity of hylomorphic compounds, the soul and the body are not two numerically distinct things, but rather go together to constitute a composite that is itself an intrinsic unity. On this view, the organic body’s potentiality for life cannot exist without being exercised, and the material body cannot exist without its form, the soul. Since Ackrill (1972/3) raised doubts about the coherence of this kind of account, there has been much lively debate as to how this relates to contemporary philosophy of mind. For instance, Sorabji (1974), describing Aristotle’s view as “sui generis,” argues that he construes every psychological state as constituted by something physical.

After discharging and disconnecting a capacitor, what causes it to develop a voltage?

Context:

Capacitors made with any type of dielectric material will show some level of "dielectric absorption" or "soakage". On discharging a capacitor and disconnecting it, after a short time it may develop a voltage due to hysteresis in the dielectric. This effect can be objectionable in applications such as precision sample and hold circuits or timing circuits. The level of absorption depends on many factors, from design considerations to charging time, since the absorption is a time-dependent process. However, the primary factor is the type of dielectric material. Capacitors such as tantalum electrolytic or polysulfone film exhibit very high absorption, while polystyrene or Teflon allow very small levels of absorption. In some capacitors where dangerous voltages and energies exist, such as in flashtubes, television sets, and defibrillators, the dielectric absorption can recharge the capacitor to hazardous voltages after it has been shorted or discharged. Any capacitor containing over 10 joules of energy is generally considered hazardous, while 50 joules or higher is potentially lethal. A capacitor may regain anywhere from 0.01 to 20% of its original charge over a period of several minutes, allowing a seemingly safe capacitor to become surprisingly dangerous.

It started with us having crushes on each other, but we hung out and decided nothing was going to happen. 

We're in the same friend group and one night we were hanging out and stuff happened. This continued for awhile, then he started to ignore me. We randomly hung out maybe a week and a half later and did more stuff. That's been the pattern since then: we hook up, don't talk for awhile, then hook up again. He's always really nice and sweet to me before we hook up, but as soon as it's over he's quiet and leaves quickly. 

I've always had a problem with that, but a few days ago we were in the middle of hooking up when he gets up, says he's late for something, and then leaves. The next night I saw him at a party and he avoided eye contact and left immediately.

I tried texting him, but he doesn't answer. This has hurt my feelings quite a bit, and I have no idea what's going on. Should I bother trying to find out what's up?

When an airplane engine starts, the propeller creates thrust and pulls the airplane forward.  As the airplane moves forward, more and more air moves over the wing.  The airplane wings are designed to be curved over the top and flat across the bottom.  As a result, the air molecules take longer to travel over the top of the wing than they do on the underside.  This creates a differential in air pressure between the top and bottom of the wing.  The difference in air pressure is called Lift.

For many years hydrogen has been stored as compressed gas or cryogenic liquid, and transported as such in cylinders, tubes, and cryogenic tanks for use in industry or as propellant in space programs.

He was known also for his work in astronomy. A number of sophists, along with like-minded poets and historians, were interested in accounting for the origins of society and culture. Although perhaps sparked by *Democritus, the anthropology that developed was mainly associated with the sophists.

We moved in together after about 6 months. Everything was still going great, despite how soon it was. We stayed home a lot, I stopped seeing my friends, my parents, all I did was work and hangout with her. 

Then I realized how depressed I really was. I wanted to be something more, something that she didn't really care for; friendly and outgoing. Not to say shes a miserable snob or anything, but she would rather make fun of people, and complain about her day. She also seems very dependent on me. She doesn't have her license, I have to ask her to clean up after herself, and make sure she looks after her health. Honestly I feel like I'm the only mature one sometimes.

In what order these three great sequences were composed is not clear, but the first one seems to show both more complete Hellenic influence and a less developed system of allegory than the other two, while the Problems and Solutions certainly appear less elaborate than the line-byline commentary. There are also a number of essays unconnected with these sequences, such as those On the Eternity of the World and On Providence, and an account of the Embassy to Gaius on behalf of the Jewish community of Alexandria on which Philo served in 39 C.E.

To speak of Philo’s philosophical position is perhaps somewhat rash, since it is not universally agreed that he has a coherent one, but it can best be seen as a form of *Middle Platonism, which adopts many *Stoic formulations (though firmly rejecting Stoic materialism and their doctrine of

In 1907, the eclectic interests of the land baron Henry E. Huntington brought surfing to the California coast. While on vacation, Huntington had seen Hawaiian boys surfing the island waves. Looking for a way to entice visitors to the area of Redondo Beach, where he had heavily invested in real estate, he hired a young Hawaiian to ride surfboards. George Freeth decided to revive the art of surfing, but had little success with the huge 500 cm (16 ft) hardwood boards that were popular at that time. When he cut them in half to make them more manageable, he created the original "Long board", which made him the talk of the islands. To the delight of visitors, Freeth exhibited his surfing skills twice a day in front of the Hotel Redondo. Another native Hawaiian, Duke Kahanamoku, spread surfing to both the U.S. and Australia, riding the waves after displaying the swimming prowess that won him Olympic gold medals in 1912 and 1920.

What are the origins or surfing in California?

Answer:

Surfing as a local pastime is a natural fit for most Californian's living near the coast. The rise in popularity of beach life in Southern California and especially the film "Gidget" exploded the desire to be a part of the rising surf culture. California was looked upon by most of the nation as trend setting and surfing served as the epitome of cool for most people looking from afar.

TITLE: Where to go after graduation? British couple, £4k budget, 2 weeks
POST: I finish my university course next May and I'm looking to take a post-graduation trip with my husband.  We're in our late twenties, based in the UK and want a trip of approximately two weeks in July or August next year.  Our budget is £4k / $6400.  I really want this to be "the adventure of our lifetime" and the ideal trip is a destination outside Europe with some overland travel included. 

Originally the plan was the Trans-Mongolian Express with some time spent in Paris, Beijing, Lhasa and Shanghai but I don't think our timescale really fits as my husband can't get any more than two weeks leave.  Alternatively, I've thought about renting an RV and driving down the West coast of the USA.  Then again, travelling around New Zealand is on both our bucket lists, but possibly too expensive when you factor in flights.  

We love visiting stunning landscapes, learning about the history and the culture of our destination, as well as eating the local food.  We'd like a trip that kept us busy but also had some time to relax here and there.  We're not keen on hostels or dormitories, but we don't need 5* hotels either.  Neither of us like visiting places that are overdeveloped with tourism, but we don't like being the only tourists around either.  

Places either one of us have visited:  Ibiza, La Palma (Canary Islands), Iceland, Maldives, Kos (Greece), NYC, Turkey, Bali, Mexico, Florida, Netherlands, Germany and Cyprus.    

Please help me plan the trip of a lifetime.

Who are the only remaining full-time hunter-gatherers in Africa?

Context:

Hunter-gathering lifestyles remained prevalent in some parts of the New World, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Siberia, as well as all of Australia, until the European Age of Discovery. They still persist in some tribal societies, albeit in rapid decline. Peoples that preserved paleolithic hunting-gathering until the recent past include some indigenous peoples of the Amazonas (Aché), some Central and Southern African (San people), some peoples of New Guinea (Fayu), the Mlabri of Thailand and Laos, the Vedda people of Sri Lanka, and a handful of uncontacted peoples. In Africa, the only remaining full-time hunter-gatherers are the Hadza of Tanzania.[citation needed]

Context:

as a way of life with an institutional form, not just as a noetic activity. Although *“Platonism” continued to be studied and practiced in some form throughout antiquity, there is no evidence that the Academy at Athens survived as a center for philosophical education after Sulla’s disastrous siege of the city in 86 B.C.E. Only mythology supports the common view that Plato’s Academy had a continuous existence at Athens until the emperor Justinian “closed the philosophical schools” in 529 C.E. *Aristotle, a non-Athenian from Stagira (Macedonia) and a former student at the Academy, established himself and his followers in the Lyceum gymnasium at Athens in 336 B.C.E. After Plato’s death in 347, Aristotle and colleagues from the Academy left Athens and formed a philosophical association in Asia Minor, first in the Troad and later in Mytilene (on Lesbos). From there Aristotle was called to the Macedonian court to tutor the young Alexander.

Aristotle was a former student of Plato's Academy.

TITLE: I saved up 10k in my checking account... I want to invest/save it?
POST: I saved up 10k in my checking account. I don't have a savings (anymore), because I always never had spare money so it was always in my checking anyway. I saved up 10k just incase I go unemployed. I feel accomplished, but now, I don't know what to do. I want to make money off of it, but I doubt I can really make any, so is a savings account my best bet. 10k seems like a lot to me, but probably not too much compared to others. What is my best bet with it assuming that I need access within a few days to pull out the money in case anything goes bad? In regards to work... my job is pretty secure. So I feel confident that I won't be out of a job anytime soon. Thanks for your comments/tips/past experience.

I see that the FAQ says I have x what to do? I am wondering if its worth it to just pay off my school loans with it... since things like bonds even seem like they'll have a small affect. 1.5 percent is only 100 dollars for 10k... and you would only get that once a year I'm guessing?

Saved 10k. Never saved anything before. No savings account. Don't believe that interest will be helpful. I think paying off a portion of school would save me more money in the long run.

What is the term for the art of public persuasion?

Context:

ists were itinerant professional teachers, who usually taught the art of public persuasion or *rhetoric. In identifying the basis of ethical norms, they tend to locate this in social institutions or practices. The position ascribed to *Protagoras (c. 485-415 B.C.E.) in Plato’s Protagoras (320-8) is that justice and the other virtues are promoted, in any given society, by public and private persuasion and are a necessary precondition of human communities and hence of human survival. This may be taken as a “communitarian” account of the basis of ethics, which Protagoras himself may have combined with ethical relativism. Socrates (469-399 B.C.E.) is presented by our sources (especially Plato, also Aristotle and to a lesser extent *Xenophon) as practising a distinctive method of systematic questioning, conducted with one person at one time and aiming at producing a logically consistent set of beliefs.
