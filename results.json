Many of his editorial decisions are undoubtedly based on his views concerning the correct order in which one should study philosophy. For instance, we know that he thought one should begin with the study of logic (Philoponus In Cat. 5.18f.; Elias In Cat. 117.24), which may well mean that the Organon stood at the beginning of his edition (as it does in modern editions).

Boethus also had interesting things to say about the \u201cimpetus\u201d of thrown bodies and the nature of time\u2014the last, characteristically, when trying to elucidate an obscure remark in Aristotle\u2019s Categories. He probably owed something to Strato, and both he and Andronicus may have been influenced by Stoic views. Later the school became more conservative.

The kind of form that makes something an animate substance of some type is not mere shape or outward appearance, but what Aristotle calls a first actuality (entelecheia).

The relationship between soul and body is that of activity or actuality to what has the potential for the exercise of that activity. What is potentially living is a body having organs, and so the soul is a first actuality of an organic body.

According to his definition, a virtue is a dispositional state of character that is concerned with choice, lying within a mean between excess and deficiency\u2014a mean relative to us, as determined by the rational principle that the man of practical wisdom would employ. A virtuous person is disposed to experience emotions appropriately, neither excessively nor deficiently.

What is appropriate for one person, however, might be too much or too little for another.

Referring now explicitly to the Socratic interrogation of the slave boy in Plato\u2019s Meno, which was meant to demonstrate that there is latent knowledge of geometry, even among the untutored, Augustine protests that not all would have been geometricians in their previous life, \u201csince there are so few of them in the human race that one can hardly be found.\u201d He goes on: We ought rather to believe that the nature of the intellectual mind is so formed",

It is a universe that, among other things, takes account of the existence of the Ecliptic (a feature passed over in the Republic) and that might also have at its center a rotating earth, though it seems more likely that the exact countermovement to sidereal movement that Plato ascribes to the earth is formulated as an argument for its stillness rather than its motion.

The physiological features of the path\u00e9 are presupposed by the ethical doctrines of all Cyrenaic philosophers, which, contrary to what scholars commonly assume, vary considerably.\nSome sources testify that Aristippus the Socratic was a hedonist positing the momentary pleasures of the present as the moral end.

Each pleasure is the moral end and there can be no difference in intensity or in degree between pleasures.

Some of his later dialogues introduce characters who deliver long uninterrupted speeches (Timaeus in the Timaeus, Critias in the Critias, and the Athenian Stranger in Laws 5).

The problem is compounded by the fact that most of our later sources are heavily influenced by a hostile tradition that portrayed the Epicureans as intemperate, licentious, and anti-intellectual, a misrepresentation that lingers in our modern term \u201cepicurean.\u201d Although Epicurus had many adherents throughout the Mediterranean world and although the Garden (the original headquarters of Epicureanism) remained active for several hundred years, Epicureanism seems never to have enjoyed complete respectability in Greek or Roman society.\nRelationship to Other Philosophical Systems.

By calculating the amount of pleasure and pain involved in each action, a person can choose a course of life that is predominantly pleasant.\nEpicurus intended his philosophy to be accessible to all persons, male and female, educated or not. His school notoriously included women (see EPICUREANISM).

Testing is required to confirm the results of theoretical speculation and to adjudicate between the conflicting theoretical pronouncements of the various Rationalist schools, and experience is needed to suggest the direction in which those speculations might profitably be pursued. Galen happily allows that Empiricists may, with certain limitations, become good doctors, although their rejection of any theoretical substructure to their empirical generalizing makes it harder for them, he thinks, to extend their understanding into new domains.

Socrates says in the Apology that he does not know whether death is a long sleep or whether we continue to live in the underworld (40c\u2014d); by contrast, in the Phaedo, Plato offers a series of proofs for the eternal existence of the soul (to be supplemented by further proofs in the Republic and Phaedrus). Similarly, the early dialogues fail to find definitions of the virtues upon which all interlocutors can agree; in the Republic, however, we find definitions of courage, temperance, wisdom, and justice\u2014and these definitions are backed by an elaborate moral and \u201cpolitical theory. The Socrates of the",

The Socrates of the early dialogues equates virtue with knowledge and never countenances the possibility that nonrational aspects of human motivation are capable of overwhelming reason; by contrast, in the Republic, the nonrational parts of the soul are divided off from the rational, and their power to overturn reason is affirmed. Accordingly, the Republic does not equate virtue merely with knowledge; rather, the virtues of temperance, courage, and justice are understood to involve the right relationship between the rational and nonrational parts of the soul. Whereas the Apology portrays Socrates as an innocent victim of unfounded prejudice, Plato tells us in the Republic (539a-b",

Whereas the Apology portrays Socrates as an innocent victim of unfounded prejudice, Plato tells us in the Republic (539a-b) that young people should not be exposed to moral controversy until they have had a rigorous mathematical training. Evidently, having achieved some distance from his teacher, Plato comes to see some merit in the charge that Socrates corrupted the young. It would be absurd to suppose that the Republic, with its elaborate political and moral theory, successfully defended definitions, and fear of the harm that can be done by moral inquiry, was written in Plato\u2019s early period and that such Socratic dialogues as the Charmides, Laches, and Euthyphro were written after it.

A universal, according to Aristotle, is \u201cof such a nature as to be predicated of many things\u201d (Int. 17a39-40). A Form, however, has a further feature beyond the one described in this definition: It is not only predicated of many things (there is one Form of fire, but there can be many fires that share in it), but it is also capable of existing separately from those many objects. Aristotle thinks there are no such things as Forms because he holds that whatever is predicable of many objects\u2014 and he assumes that Forms have this feature\u2014must depend for its existence on the objects of which it is predicated, a dependency that Plato takes Forms to lack.

In any case, Plato makes it clear that justice and the other virtues are not the only goods worth having; they are desirable both for their own sake and for the sake of the extrinsic rewards that they normally bring. In the main body of the Republic, however, he sets aside these extrinsic rewards, because he thinks it important to show that even when they are excluded\u2014 in fact, even when they are replaced by their opposites\u2014it is still the case that for one\u2019s own good one should be a just person.

Philosophy correspondingly came to regard tragedy, whether favorably or adversely, as an urgent object of attention.\nReacting against an older tendency to treat the tragedians explicitly as \u201cthinkers,\u201d modern critics have often stressed the distinction between drama and discursive thought. But this contrast in turn needs qualifying in two important respects: first, because an exclusive identification of philosophy with systematic theorizing is inappropriate for the Greek tradition; second, because Greek culture, with its notion of poets as sages and teachers, constantly looked for morally instructive meanings and normative paradigms within poetry. Debate about the degree to which determinate ideas are conveyed by the experiences of tragic agents remains delicate. We can nonetheless reasonably approach tragedy as a major manifestation of traditions of reflection that also helped to shape philosophy. Among the potentially philosophical topics with which tragedy engages are the tensions between human desire and the larger structure of reality, the psychology of human beings facing ultimate dilemmas, and the character of extreme conflicts of value. It will always, however, be problematic to try to detach such insights from the dramatic particularity in which they are embedded and which give them their vivid power. The following sketch is per",

Unquestionably the most influential of them was *Protagoras, who purported to teach *virtue and pronounced that \u201cman is the measure of all things: of things that are, that they are, and of things that are not, that they are not.\u201d As interpreted by *Plato in the Theaetetus, this dictum asserts that a proposition is true for someone if, and only if, he believes it, and false for that person if, and only if, he disbelieves it",

His view that a human being is the measure of all things (B1) is presented in Plato as equivalent to the claim that perception is knowledge and also to a form of relativism: \u201cEach thing is to me such as it appears to me, and is to you such as it appears to you\u201d (Tht. 152a). Plato has Socrates continue with an elaborate reconstruction or Protagoras\u2019 theory in terms of a *Heraclitean ontology (by which all things are ceaselessly changing) and a theory of perception as interactive (sometimes known as Plato\u2019s theory of perception).

Among the corollaries of the measure doctrine, as Socrates interprets it, are the relativity of moral judgments and the impossibility of authoritative teaching on justice. Socrates goes on to show that if each of us is an authority on what is true for us, we can have no reason to listen to Protagoras when he tells us so; and if he defends his view against criticism he thereby joins his critics, since his view implies that no opinion can be defended against any other (Tht. 171).

The long speech of the Protagoras gives a different impression.

On the other hand, he constricted the scope of rhetoric by limiting its application to just those matters of uncertainty that fell outside the boundaries of other arts (1.2, 1357al-\u20147).\nFrom the final quarter of the fourth century through the first half of the second, rhetorical theory continued to develop, though largely along established lines and more in philosophical than in rhetorical schools. In the school of *Nausiphanes, for instance, the traditional interest of rhetoricians in public affairs emerged in a linkage of rhetoric with statesmanship, both of which were to arise in philosophers with mastery of phusiologia or the theory of Nature (Philod. On Rhetoric, PHerc. 1015/ 832 col. 38 Sudhaus). Among the *Peripatetics, *Theophrastus elaborated Aristotle\u2019s nascent theories of expression and delivery, the former by isolating a canon of",

Nonetheless, it was important for Arcesilaus, as for any other ancient skeptic, to show that living a life while suspending judgment was at least possible. And in response to the charge, probably from the Stoics, that epoch\u00e9 ruled out rational choice, and indeed action of any kind, Arcesilaus argued that one can direct one\u2019s actions by reference to \u201cthe reasonable\u201d (eulogon), rather than on the basis of any supposed \u201ccognitive impressions,\u201d and that, contrary to the Stoic contention, action does not require assent\u2014that is, commitment to the truth of some proposition\u2014and hence is compatible with epoch\u00e9.

About 300 B.C.E. he set up as a philosopher in his own right, lecturing near the Athenian agora in the Stoa poikil\u00e9 (\u201cPainted Colonnade\u201d), from which the name of his school and its adherents is derived.

Although the arguments have sometimes been dismissed as fallacious, many philosophers have shown that their resolution demands the investigation of profound questions about the nature of infinity, space, time, and the adequacy of quantitative analysis for describing and understanding natural phenomena. Recent philosophers have argued that Zeno\u2019s arguments succeed, but only because they describe tasks it is logically impossible to perform. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Texts in DK29. Furley, D., in A. P. D.
