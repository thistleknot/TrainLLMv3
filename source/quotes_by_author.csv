816,Never get to the point where you will be ashamed to ask anybody for information. The ignorant man will always be ignorant if he fears that by asking another for information he will display ignorance. Better once display your ignorance of a certain subject than always know nothing of it.
817,Think about it: we went into slavery pagans; we came out Christians. We went into slavery pieces of property; we came out American citizens. We went into slavery with chains clanking about our wrists; we came out with the American ballot in our hands.

826,"Do you believe that the God of Jesus loves you beyond worthiness and unworthiness, beyond fidelity and infidelity—that he loves you in the morning sun and in the evening rain—that he loves you when your intellect denies it, your emotions refuse it, your whole being rejects it. Do you believe that God loves without condition or reservation and loves you this moment as you are and not as you should be."
827,"The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable."
828,"I have a word for you. I know your whole life story. I know every skeleton in your closet. I know every moment of sin, shame, dishonesty and degraded love that has darkened your past. Right now I know your shallow faith, your feeble prayer life, your inconsistent discipleship. And my word is this: I dare you to trust that I love you just as you are, and not as you should be. Because you’re never going to be as you should be."

 wild enough to be burnt in the fire of love,
 real enough to make others see how phony you are."

834,"What makes authentic disciples is not visions, ecstasies, biblical mastery of chapter and verse, or spectacular success in the ministry, but a capacity for faithfulness. Buffeted by the fickle winds of failure, battered by their own unruly emotions, and bruised by rejection and ridicule, authentic disciples may have stumbled and frequently fallen, endured lapses and relapses, gotten handcuffed to the fleshpots and wandered into a far county. Yet, they kept coming back to Jesus."

837,"Lord, when I feel that what I'm doing is insignificant and unimportant, help me to remember that everything I do is significant and important in your eyes, because you love me and you put me here, and no one else can do what I am doing in exactly the way I do it."
838,"Define yourself radically as one beloved by God.  This is the true self.  Every other identity is illusion.  God's love for you and his choice of you constitute your worth.  Accept that, and let it become the most important thing in your life."
839,"God is enough. That is the root of peace. When we start seeking something besides Him, we lose it."

841,My deepest awareness of myself is that I am deeply loved by Jesus Christ and I have done nothing to earn it or deserve it.
842,"To live by grace means to acknowledge my whole life story, the light side and the dark. In admitting my shadow side I learn who I am and what God's grace means."
843,That which is denied cannot be healed.
844,The litmus test of our love for God is our love of neighbor.

 be broken; to be broken is to stand in need of grace."

848,Jesus reveals a God who does not demand but who gives; who does not oppress but who raises up; who does not wound but who heals; who does not condemn but forgives.
849,"Christianity doesn’t deny the reality of suffering and evil… Our hope… is not based on the idea that we are going to be free of pain and suffering. Rather, it is based on the conviction that we will triumph over suffering."
850,
851,"I define connection as the energy that exists between people when they feel seen, heard, and valued; when they can give and receive without judgment; and when they derive sustenance and strength from the relationship."
852,"When we deny our stories, They define us. When we own our stories, we get to write the ending."
853,"Joy is not a constant. It comes to us in moments - often ordinary moments. Sometimes we miss out on the bursts of joy because we're too busy chasing down the extraordinary moments. Other times we're so afraid of the dark we don't dare let ourselves enjoy the light. A joyful life is not a floodlight of joy. That would eventually become unbearable. I believe a joyful life is made up of joyful moments gracefully strung together by trust, gratitude and inspiration"
854,"We can have courage or we can have comfort, but we cannot have both."
855,Don't try to win over the haters; you are not a jackass whisperer.
856,Daring greatly means the courage to be vulnerable. It means to show up and be seen. To ask for what you need. To talk about how you're feeling. To have the hard conversations.
857,"Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change."
858,Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light.

860,Imperfections are not inadequacies; they are reminders that we're all in this together.
861,Owning our story can be hard but not nearly as difficult as spending our lives running from it. Embracing our vulnerabilities is risky but not nearly as dangerous as giving up on love and belonging and joy—the experiences that make us the most vulnerable. Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light.
862,"Healthy striving is self-focused: ""How can I improve?"" Perfectionism is other-focused: ""What will they think?"""
863,"People may call what happens at midlife 'a crisis,' but it's not.  It's an unraveling - a time when you feel a desperate pull to live the life you want to live, not the one you're 'supposed' to live.  The unraveling is a time when you are challenged by the universe to let go of who you think you are supposed to be and to embrace who you are."
864,We're all so busy chasing the extraordinary that we forget to stop and be grateful for the ordinary.
865,Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love.

868,Nothing has transformed my life more than realizing that it's a waste of time to evaluate my worthiness by weighing the reaction of the people in the stands.
869,"Our stories are not meant for everyone. Hearing them is a privilege, and we should always ask ourselves this before we share: ""Who has earned the right to hear my story?"" If we have one or two people in our lives who can sit with us and hold space for our shame stories, and love us for our strengths and struggles, we are incredibly lucky. If we have a friend, or small group of friends, or family who embraces our imperfections, vulnerabilities, and power, and fills us with a sense of belonging, we are incredibly lucky."
870,"If we can share our story with someone who responds with empathy and understanding, shame can't survive."
871,"Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage. Truth and courage aren't always comfortable, but they're never weakness."
872,"The willingness to show up changes us, It makes us a little braver each time."
873,What makes you vulnerable makes you beautiful.
874,"Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. And our world could stand to be a little kinder and braver."
875,
876,Expect wonderful things to happen to you. Get up each morning and say; 'I believe something wonderful is going to happen to me today.'
877,Learn from the experts. Study successful men and women and do what they do and you'll be successful too.

887,Almost any decision is better than no decision at all.

890,"A clear vision, backed by definite plans, gives you a tremendous feeling of confidence and personal power."
891,"Your choice of people to associate with, both personally and business-wise, is one of the most important choices you make.  If you associate with turkeys, you will never fly with the eagles."
892,"Stress comes from within; it is your reaction to circumstances, not the circumstances themselves."
893,Confidence on the outside begins by living with integrity on the inside.
894,"Think about your future possibilities and the fact that your potential is virtually unlimited. You can do what you want to do and go where you want to go. You can be the person you want to be. You can set large and small goals and make plans and move step-by-step, progressively toward their realization. There are no obstacles to what you can accomplish except the obstacles that you create in your mind."
895,The key to success is to focus our conscious mind on things we desire not things we fear.
896,One of the marks of successful people is they are action oriented. One of the marks of average people is they are talk oriented.
897,An attitude of positive expectation is the mark of the superior personality.

899,"Everything counts! Everything you do helps or hurts, adds up or takes away."
900,
901,"Absorb what is useful, discard what is not, add what is uniquely your own."
902,Are you going to let the obstacles in your life be stumbling blocks or stepping stones? Choose the positive. You are the master of your attitude.
903,"I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times."

952,"Let your greatest possession be the ability to let go of any possession, joyfully."
953,It's not wrong to be upset. It's not wrong to cry. It's not wrong to want attention. It's not even wrong to scream or throw a fit. What is wrong is to keep it all inside. What is wrong is to blame and punish yourself for simply being human. What is wrong is to never be heard and to be alone in your pain. Share it. Let it out.
954,"Your struggle is your strength. If you can resist becoming negative, bitter or hopeless, in time, your struggles will give you everything."

984,"I discovered that when I believed my thoughts, I suffered, but that when I didn’t believe them, I didn’t suffer, and that this is true for every human being. Freedom is as simple as that. I found that suffering is optional. I found a joy within me that has never disappeared, not for a single moment."

987,It's not the darkness that people fear; it's what they imagine into the darkness.

995,My experience is that the teachers we need most are the people we're living with right now.
996,Peace doesn't require two people; it requires only one. It has to be you. The problem begins and ends there.
997,"If you want real control, drop the illusion of control; let life have you. It does anyway. You’re just telling yourself the story of how it doesn’t."
998,"I can find only three kinds of business in the universe: mine, yours and God's. Much of our stress comes from mentally living out of our business. When I think, ""You need to get a job, I want you to be happy, you should be on time, you need to take better care of yourself,"" I am in your business. When I'm worried about earthquakes, floods, war, or when I will die, I am in God's business. If I am mentally in your business or in God's business, the effect is separation."

1002,"Life with God is not immunity from difficulties, but peace in difficulties."
1003,"Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience."
1004,"Once people stop believing in God, the problem is not that they will believe in nothing; rather, the problem is that they will believe anything."

1009,
1010,There is someone that I love even though I don't approve of what he does. There is someone I accept though some of his thoughts and actions revolt me. There is someone I forgive though he hurts the people I love the most. That person is......me.
1011,One of the most cowardly things ordinary people do is to shut their eyes to facts.
1012,"I'm not sure God wants us to be happy. I think he wants us to love, and be loved. But we are like children, thinking our toys will make us happy and the whole world is our nursery. Something must drive us out of that nursery and into the lives of others, and that something is suffering."

1022,A sign of a culture that has lost its faith - Moral collapse follows upon spiritual collapse.
1023,Don't let your happiness depend on something you may lose.
1024,"There are two kinds of love: we love wise and kind and beautiful people because we need them, but we love (or try to love) stupid and disagreeable people because they need us. This second kind is the more divine because that is how God loves us: not because we are lovable but because He is love, not because He needs to receive but He delights to give."
1025,
1026,Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not: nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not: the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.
1027,
1028,"Restricted immigration is not an offensive but purely a defensive action. It is not adopted in criticism of others in the slightest degree, but solely for the purpose of protecting ourselves.

1029,You can't increase prosperity by taxing success.

1033,"We do not need more material development, we need more spiritual development. We do not need more intellectual power, we need more moral power. We do not need more knowledge, we need more character. We do not need more government, we need more culture. We do not need more law, we need more religion. We do not need more of the things that are seen, we need more of the things that are unseen. It is on that side of life that it is desirable to put the emphasis at the present time. If that side be strengthened, the other side will take care of itself."
1034,Silence can never be misquoted.
1035,"In life there is nothing more common than talent and intelligence. What is missing is passion, persistence, commitment, and dedication."
1036,"The collection of taxes which are not absolutely required, which do not beyond reasonable doubt contribute to public welfare, is only a species of legalized larceny. Under this Republic the rewards of industry belong to those who earn them."

1046,"I want the people of America to be able to work less for the government, and more for themselves"
1047,"In its main features the Declaration of Independence is a great spiritual document. It is a declaration not of material but of spiritual conceptions. Equality, liberty, popular sovereignty, the rights of man - these are not elements which we can see and touch. They are ideals. They have their source and their roots in the religious convictions. They belong to the unseen world. Unless the faith of the American people in these religious convictions is to endure, the principles of our Declaration will perish. We can not continue to enjoy the result if we neglect and abandon the cause."
1048,"We do not need more intellectual power, we need more spiritual power. We do not need more of the things that are seen, we need more of the things that are unseen."
1049,"There is no dignity quite so impressive, and no one independence quite so important, as living within your means."
1050,
1051,"Knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darkness's of other people. One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. The most terrifying thing is to accept oneself completely. Your visions will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes."
1052,"The world will ask you who you are, and if you don't know, the world will tell you."
1053,
1054,"We are not what happened to us, we are what we wish to become."
1055,
1056,"Life really does begin at forty. Up until then, you are just doing research."
1057,"Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes."

1061,
1062,"Be grateful for your difficulties and challenges, for they hold blessings. In fact... Man needs difficulties; they are necessary for health personal growth, individuation and self-actualisation."
1063,Everyone you meet knows something you don't know but need to know.  Learn from them.
1064,"No tree, it is said, can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell."
1065,"A man likes to believe that he is the master of his soul. But as long as he is unable to control his moods and emotions, or to be conscious of the myriad secret ways in which unconscious factors insinuate themselves into his arrangements and decisions, he is certainly not his own master."
1066,We don't really heal anything; we simply let it go.
1067,The privilege of a lifetime is to become who you truly are.
1068,"We cannot change anything until we accept it. Condemnation does not liberate, it oppresses."
1069,The most dangerous things in the world are immense accumulations of human beings who are manipulated by only a few heads.
1070,Wisdom accepts that all things have two sides
1071,"Solitude is for me a fount of healing which makes my life worth living. Talking is often a torment for me, and I need many days of silence to recover from the futility of words."
1072,We meet ourselves time and again in a thousand disguises on the path of life.
1073,To ask the right question is already half the solution of a problem.
1074,"People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own souls. They will practice Indian yoga and all its exercises, observe a strict regimen of diet, learn the literature of the whole world - all because they cannot get on with themselves and have not the slightest faith that anything useful could ever come out of their own souls."
1075,"One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back."
1076,"Even through your hardest days, remember we are all made of stardust."
1077,Nothing disturbs me more than the glorification of stupidity.
1078,"Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known."
1079,Our passion for learning ... is our tool for survival.
1080,"If we can't think for ourselves, if we're unwilling to question authority, then we're just putty in the hands of those in power. But if the citizens are educated and form their own opinions, then those in power work for us. In every country, we should be teaching our children the scientific method and the reasons for a Bill of Rights. With it comes a certain decency, humility and community spirit. In the demon-haunted world that we inhabit by virtue of being human, this may be all that stands between us and the enveloping darkness."
1081,
1082,
1083,"I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time - [...] when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness."
1084,"You can't convince a believer of anything; for their belief is not based on evidence, it's based on a deep seated need to believe"
1085,
1086,We live on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam
1087,"If we are not able to ask skeptical questions, to interrogate those who tell us that something is true, to be skeptical of those in authority, then, we are up for grabs for the next charlatan (political or religious) who comes rambling along."
1088,The truth may be puzzling. It may take some work to grapple with. It may be counterintuitive. It may contradict deeply held prejudices. It may not be consonant with what we desperately want to be true. But our preferences do not determine what's true.
1089,"The words ""question"" and ""quest"" are cognates. Only through inquiry can we discover truth."
1090,"Cosmos is a Greek word for the order of the universe. It is, in a way, the opposite of Chaos. It implies the deep interconnectedness of all things. It conveys awe for the intricate and subtle way in which the universe is put together."
1091,You have to know the past to understand the present.
1092,"The dumbing down of America is evident in the slow decay of substantive content, a kind of celebration of ignorance."
1093,Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence
1094,"The universe is a pretty big place. If it's just us, seems like an awful waste of space."
1095,One of the great commandments of science is: 'Mistrust arguments from authority.'
1096,"Finding the occasional straw of truth awash in a great ocean of confusion and bamboozle requires intelligence, vigilance, dedication, and courage. But if we don't practice these tough habits of thought, we cannot hope to solve the truly serious problems that face us --- and we risk becoming a nation of suckers, up for grabs by the next charlatan who comes along."
1097,"It is the responsibility of scientists never to suppress knowledge, no matter how awkward that knowledge is, no matter how it may bother those in power; we are not smart enough to decide which pieces of knowledge are permissible, and which are not."
1098,Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it we go nowhere.
1099,The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence.
1100,
1101,Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me.
1102,"Before you go to bed, write down three 'gratefuls' for the day and three 'did wells' (they can even include something as simple as doing the laundry)-the results can be amazing!"
1103,It's almost impossible to be funnier than the people in Washington.
1104,"You have to have faith that there is a reason you go through certain things. I can't say I'm glad to go through pain, but in a way one must, in order to gain courage and really feel joy."
1105,"When you have a dream, you've got to grab it and never let go."
1106,No one ever said life was fair. Just Eventful.
1107,You have to go through the falling down in order to learn to walk. It helps to know that you can survive it. That's an education in itself.
1108,"Words, once they are printed, have a life of their own."
1109,Comedy is tragedy plus time.
1110,"If you want to know the feeling [of labor pain], just take your bottom lip and pull it over your head."
1111,"It's also selfish because it makes you feel good when you help others. I've been helped by acts of kindness from strangers. That's why we're here, after all, to help others."
1112,I think we're here for each other.
1113,We don't stop going to school when we graduate.
1114,Because nobody goes through life without a scar.

1117,"If you see a kid in school, who is a little shy ... that's when you should reach out. When you do, you are going to open up a flower and discover something wonderful."
1118,"I have always grown from my problems and challenges, from the things that don't work out, that's when I've really learned."
1119,"You do have to love your kids enough to let them hate you. But it's the disease that's hating you, not them."
1120,I couldn't get the laughter out of my head. It wasn't career. It wasn't even a choice. It was a calling.
1121,"The first time someone said, 'What are your measurements?' I answered, '37, 24, 38 - but not necessarily in that order.'"
1122,I'm really not that funny in real life. But I am the best audience one could find. I love to laugh.
1123,Adolescence is just one big walking pimple.
1124,The audience is never wrong.
1125,
1126,"We are not meant to stay wounded. We are supposed to move through our tragedies and challenges and to help each other move through the many painful episodes of our lives. By remaining stuck in the power of our wounds, we block our own transformation. We overlook the greater gifts inherent in our wounds - the strength to overcome them and the lessons that we are meant to receive through them. Wounds are the means through which we enter the hearts of other people. They are meant to teach us to become compassionate and wise."
1127,"Just let go. Let go of how you thought your life should be, and embrace the life that is trying to work its way into your consciousness."
1128,"When you do not seek or need approval, you are at your most powerful."
1129,"Every single choice we make is either going to enhance the spirit or drain it. Every day, we're either giving ourselves power or taking it away."
1130,"Always go with the choice that scares you the most, because that's the one that is going to require the most from you.  Do you really want to look back on your life and see how wonderful it could have been had you not been afraid to live it?"
1131,"Forgiveness is a mystical act, not a reasonable one."
1132,"You have resources yet to be unleashed. Make bold, courageous choices. Live as though you have the power to change the world - because you do."
1133,"Self-love means caring for ourselves enough to forgive people in our past so that the wounds can no longer damage us - for our wounds do not hurt the people who hurt us, they hurt only us."
1134,Our lives change externally as we change internally.
1135,My prayer today is to become more mindful of my personal actions. What motivates me to do what I do and to say the things I do to others? I often dismiss my actions because of stress or anger but the people I hurt along the way do not dismiss what I've said or done. Every action and every word carries a consequence. Every person has stress and every person has anger. I would not like to be someone's target and I ask for the grace to become more mindful not to harm others just because I am having a bad day.
1136,"Get a backbone, not a wishbone."
1137,"The ability to know that your perceptions are accurate has to happen without others' validation. Intuition is not the result of diet, rituals, or wind chimes. It's the natural consequence of having self-esteem, the greatest power you can have. With self-esteem, your life can broaden into an adventure because you can know in your gut that you can handle the unknown. And you can handle helping others without fear, which is true liberation."
1138,Let me give up the need to know why things happen as they do. I will never know and constant wondering is constant suffering.
1139,"To love yourself, truly love yourself, is to finally discover the essence of personal courage, self-respect, integrity, and self-esteem. These are the qualities of grace that come directly from a soul with stamina."
1140,"Get bored with your past, it's over!"
1141,"Forgiveness, quite frankly, is the most selfish thing you can do. Because it is the greatest thing you can do for yourself."
1142,"Act on your inner guidance, and give up your need for 'proof' that your inner guidance is authentic. The more you ask for proof, the less likely you are to receive any."
1143,"The moment you come to trust chaos, you see God clearly. Chaos is divine order, versus human order. Change is divine order, versus human order. When the chaos becomes safety to you, then you know you're seeing God clearly."
1144,Whatever is in me is stronger than what is out there to defeat me.
1145,"Between thinking and seeing, there is a place called knowing."
1146,"Whenever you become empowered,
you will be tested."
1147,"If anyone tries to complicate your life, turn and walk away from them."
1148,"Healing... is an active and internal process that includes investigating one's attitudes, memories and beliefs with the desire to release all negative patterns that prevent one's full emotional and spiritual recovery.  This internal review inevitably leads one to review one's external circumstances in an effort to recreate one's life in a way that serves activation of will - the will to see and accept truths about one's life and how one has used one's energies; and the will to begin to use energy for the creation of love, self-esteem, and health."
1149,"Being of service is not an option, it is a biological necessity. Every kind of action we do for someone is a reanimation of our own life force - and of the other person's."
1150,
1151,"The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts, while the stupid ones are full of confidence."
1152,
1153,Wherever the crowd goes run in the other direction. They're always wrong.
1154,"People are strange: They are constantly angered by trivial things, but on a major matter like totally wasting their lives, they hardly seem to notice."
1155,what matters most is how well you walk through the fire
1156,"If something burns your soul with purpose and desire, it’s your duty to be reduced to ashes by it. Any other form of existence will be yet another dull book in the library of life."
1157,Find what you love and let it kill you.
1158,Intellectuals say simple things in difficult ways. Artists say difficult things in simple ways.
1159,The difference between a democracy and a dictatorship is that in a democracy you vote first and take orders later; in a dictatorship you don't have to waste your time voting.
1160,"If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even start."
1161,
1162,The wisest thing to do if you’re living in hell is to make yourself comfortable.
1163,Don't fight your demons. Your demons are here to teach you lessons. Sit down with your demons and have a drink and a chat and learn their names and talk about the burns on their fingers and scratches on their ankles. Some of them are very nice.
1164,"Some people like what you do, some people hate what you do, but most people simply don't give a damn."
1165,"I think that the world should be full of cats and full of rain, that's all, just cats and rain, rain and cats, very nice, good night."

1167,"Simplicity is always the secret, to a profound truth, to doing things, to writing, to painting. Life is profound in its simplicity"
1168,"I stopped looking for a Dream Girl, I just wanted one that wasn't a nightmare."
1169,"I see men assassinated around me every day. I walk through rooms of the dead, streets of the dead, cities of the dead; men without eyes, men without voices; men with manufactured feelings and standard reactions; men with newspaper brains, television souls and high school ideas."
1170,You have to die a few times before you can really live.
1171,Beware of those who seek constant crowds; they are nothing alone.
1172,nobody can save you but yourself and you’re worth saving. it’s a war not easily won but if anything is worth winning then this is it.
1173,"I was laying in bed one night and I thought 'I'll just quit - to hell with it.' And another little voice inside me said 'Don't quit - save that tiny little ember of spark.' And never give them that spark because as long as you have that spark, you can start the greatest fire again."
1174,"The world is full of boring, identical and mindless people."
1175,
1176,"The most important thing in life is to stop saying 'I wish' and start saying 'I will.' Consider nothing impossible, then treat possibilities as probabilities."
1177,My advice is to never do tomorrow what you can do today. Procrastination is the thief of time.
1178,
1179,
1180,Do all the good you can and make as little fuss about it as possible.
1181,"Happiness is a gift and the trick is not to expect it, but to delight in it when it comes."
1182,No one is useless in this world who lightens the burden of it to anyone else.
1183,A man is lucky if he is the first love of a woman. A woman is lucky if she is the last love of a man.
1184,The world belongs to those who set out to conquer it armed with self confidence and good humour.
1185,We never tire of the friendships we form with books.
1186,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair."
1187,We forge the chains we wear in life.
1188,The whole difference between construction and creation is exactly this: that a thing constructed can only be loved after it is constructed; but a thing created is loved before it exists.
1189,"The sun himself is weak when he first rises, and gathers strength and courage as the day gets on."
1190,"True love believes everything, and bears everything, and trusts everything."
1191,"Time and tide will wait for no man, saith the adage. But all men have to wait for time and tide."
1192,"The American elite is almost beyond redemption. . . . Moral relativism has set in so deeply that the gilded classes have become incapable of discerning right from wrong. Everything can be explained away, especially by journalists. Life is one great moral mush--sophistry washed down with Chardonnay. The ordinary citizens, thank goodness, still adhere to absolutes.... It is they who have saved the republic from creeping degradation while their 'betters' were derelict."
1193,The worst of all listeners is the man who does nothing but listen.
1194,There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor.

1207,"If you're doing something the same way you have been doing it for ten years, the chances are you are doing it wrong."
1208,"It doesn't matter if you try and try and try again, and fail. It does matter if you try and fail, and fail to try again."
1209,here is a great difference between knowing a thing and understanding it. You can know a lot and not really understand anything.
1210,"Keep on going and the chances are you will stumble on something, perhaps when you are least expecting it. I have never heard of anyone stumbling on something sitting down."
1211,The whole fun of living is trying to make something better.
1212,"Every great improvement has come after repeated failures. Virtually nothing comes out right the first time. Failures, repeated failures, are finger posts on the road to achievement. One fails forward toward success."

1220,An inventor is simply a fellow who doesn't take his education too seriously.
1221,"This problem, too, will look simple after it is solved."
1222,I think that the greatest education in the world is the education which helps one to be able to do the right things at the time it has to be done.
1223,I don't want men of experience working for me. The experienced man is always telling me why something can't be done. The fellow who has not had any experience is so dumb he doesn't know a thing can't be done - and he goes ahead and does it.
1224,"Action without intelligence is a form of insanity, but intelligence without action is the greatest form of stupidity in the world."
1225,
1226,"You may fear that the Lord has passed you by, but it is not so: he who counts the stars, and calls them by their names, is in no danger of forgetting his own children. He knows your case as thoroughly as if you were the only creature he ever made, or the only saint he ever loved. Approach him and be at peace."

1231,"It is not a matter of time so much as a matter of heart; if you have the heart to pray, you will find the time."
1232,"God is too good to be unkind and He is too wise to be mistaken. And when we cannot trace His hand, we must trust His heart. When you are so weak that you cannot do much more than cry, you coin diamonds with both your eyes. The sweetest prayers God ever hears are the groans and sighs of those who have no hope in anything but his love."
1233,"When God places a burden upon you, He places His arms underneath you."
1234,You will never know God's strength until He has supported you in deep waters.

1244,"I know of no better thermometer to your spiritual temperature than this, the measure of the intensity of your prayer."
1245,"You and I cannot be useful if we want to be sweet as honey in the mouths of men. God will never bless us if we wish to please men, that they may think well of us. Are you willing to tell them what will break your own heart in the telling and break theirs in the hearing? If not, you are not fit to serve the Lord. You must be willing to go and speak for God, though you will be rejected."
1246,Nearness to God brings likeness to God. The more you see God the more of God will be seen in you.
1247,The greatest enemy to human souls is the self-righteous spirit which makes men look to themselves for salvation.
1248,"God does not need your strength: he has more than enough of power of his own. He asks your weakness: he has none of that himself, and he is longing, therefore, to take your weakness, and use it as the instrument in his own mighty hand. Will you not yield your weakness to him, and receive his strength?"
1249,You will never know the fullness of Christ until you know the emptiness of everything but Christ.
1250,
1251,"The news is not about news anymore. It's about protecting some people, destroying others and shoving a socialist agenda down the collective throats of America."
1252,"You'd better watch where you go, and remember where you've been"
1253,"I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ... if I can't take him with me, I don't want to go."
1254,What this world needs is a few more Rednecks.
1255,"As in the case of California, the wolf is at the door of America and the present administration acts as if it's a pussycat. America cannot maintain the present entitlement programs and support a government this size and keep on living on a credit card."
1256,"Just take them rascals [rapists, killers, child abusers] out in the swamp / Put 'em on their knees and tie 'em to a stump / Let the rattlers and the bugs and the alligators do the rest."
1257,"The United States of America took a giant step toward a totalitarian socialist government when the Supreme Court voted to uphold Obamacare, allowing the individual mandate for the government to force American citizens to buy health insurance whether they want to or not."
1258,Marry somebody you love. That's the whole thing. And continue to love them.
1259,I couldn't care less about politically correct.
1260,"I've been to Iraq three times. I've been to Afghanistan, I've been quite a few places, and I want to tell you something, these kids, they're the best we've got. They're the best Americans, they're the most loyal Americans we've got. And we owe them when they come back."
1261,I don't know where the time went. I sure have enjoyed it.
1262,I don't want to go anywhere where Jesus can't go.
1263,"Well, I just can't play the game anymore. I'm 63 years old, and I've been in the business for 40 years now. I take good advice and direction really well, but I don't need somebody that finished college two years ago to come in and tell me what I should be recording."
1264,I ain't askin' nobody for nuttin' if I cain't get it on my own.
1265,"I think we should keep voting, I think we should keep supporting things that we believe in. I don't think we ought to just quit."
1266,"So say it loud and let it ring We are all a part of everything The future, present and the past Fly on proud bird You're free at last"
1267,I just thank God I can make a living doing something I enjoy as much as I do playing music.
1268,I can't imagine not having a reason to get out of bed at night.
1269,"You marry somebody you love, that you feel like you want to spend the rest of your life with, that you're excited to wake up with every morning if you enjoy spending the day with. Right now... my wife is my best friend, by far my best friend."
1270,"People say, ""Well, we're all just going to die and go to heaven anyway, or Jesus is going to come back"" or something. I don't feel like God wants us just to lay down and die just because that's going to happen. I think we should keep trying."
1271,"A friend of mine, that I had known for some time, came up one day with an old guitar. I don't know where he got it, I don't know how long he'd had it, but he knew about two chords on it. He proceeded to teach them to me, and then we proceeded to go crazy over music."
1272,"Make sure to be honest with yourself, about if that's really what you want to do with your life - to make music. It takes a commitment - a tremendous, thick-skinned commitment of being the first one to get there and the last one to leave, doing what you want to do even if you have to work twice as hard as anybody else ever did."
1273,"We didn't have a garage to rehearse in. We had to aggravate the folks in the house. But I got a chance to play in a beer joint, and that's how it started."
1274,"I had been on the road for a long time and was not really getting anywhere. Bob Johnston, a friend of mine, had taken over Columbia in Nashville. He asked me if I wanted to come down. I did - thank God I did."

1283,Better to be without logic than without feeling.

1292,"Youth has its romance, and maturity its wisdom, as morning and spring have their freshness, noon and summer their power, night and winter their repose. Each attribute is good in its own season."
1293,"A great deal; you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way; they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should - so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again."
1294,Remorse is the poison of life.
1295,But life is a battle: may we all be enabled to fight it well!
1296,Look twice before you leap.

1298,The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator.
1299,It is not violence that best overcomes hate -- nor vengeance that most certainly heals injury.
1300,
1301,"Nobody's going to do your life for you. You have to do it yourself, whether you're rich or poor, out of money or raking it in, the beneficiary of ridiculous fortune or terrible injustice. And you have to do it no matter what is true. No matter what is hard. No matter what unjust, sad, sucky things befall you. Self-pity is a dead-end road. You make the choice to drive down it. It's up to you to decide to stay parked there or to turn around and drive out."
1302,Don't surrender all your joy for an idea you used to have about yourself that isn't true anymore.
1303,"Whatever happens to you belongs to you. Make it yours. Feed it to yourself even if it feels impossible to swallow. Let it nurture you, because it will."
1304,"If someone is being unkind or petty or jealous or distant or weird, you don't have to take it in. You don't have to turn it into a big psychodrama about your worth. That behavior so often is not even about you. Don't own other people's crap."
1305,"Love is our essential nutrient. Without it, life has little meaning. It's the best thing we have to give and the most valuable thing we receive. It's worthy of all the hullabaloo."
1306,"Nobody will protect you from your suffering. You can't cry it away or eat it away or starve it away or walk it away or punch it away or even therapy it away. It's just there, and you have to survive it. You have to endure it. You have to live through it and love it and move on and be better for it and run as far as you can in the direction of your best and happiest dreams across the bridge that was built by your own desire to heal."
1307,"I knew that if I allowed fear to overtake me, my journey was doomed. Fear, to a great extent, is born of a story we tell ourselves, and so I chose to tell myself a different story from the one women are told. I decided I was safe. I was strong. I was brave. Nothing could vanquish me."
1308,You will come to know things that can only be known with the wisdom of age and the grace of years. Most of those things will have to do with forgiveness.
1309,You cannot convince people to love you. This is an absolute rule. No one will ever give you love because you want him or her to give it. Real love moves freely in both directions. Don’t waste your time on anything else.
1310,My mom said there's a sunrise and a sunset every day and you can choose to be there or not. You can put yourself in the way of beauty.

1314,"I asked, often out loud: Who is tougher than me? The answer was always the same, and even when I knew absolutely there was no way on this earth that it was true, I said it anyway: No one."
1315,The useless days will add up to something. The shitty waitressing jobs. The hours writing in your journal. The long meandering walks. The hours reading poetry and story collections and novels and dead people’s diaries and wondering about sex and God and whether you should shave under your arms or not. These things are your becoming.
1316,"The father’s job is to teach his children how to be warriors, to give them the confidence to get on the horse to ride into battle when it’s necessary to do so. If you don’t get that from your father, you have to teach yourself."
1317,"The story of human intimacy is one of constantly allowing ourselves to see those we love most deeply in a new, more fractured light. Look hard. Risk that."
1318,"Uncertain as I was as I pushed forward. I felt right in my pushing, as if the effort itself meant something."
1319,Self-pity is a dead-end road. You make the choice to drive down it. It's up to you to decide to stay parked there or to turn around and drive out.
1320,"So much of what I've learned, so much of what's good in my life, was learned because something bad happened, or from making the wrong decision. Through bad decisions I learned how to find the ways to make the right ones."
1321,The place of true healing is a fierce place. It's a giant place. it's a place of monstrous beauty and endless dark and glimmering light.
1322,"It was my life — like all lives, mysterious and irrevocable and sacred. So very close, so very present, so very belonging to me. How wild it was, to let it be."
1323,"I'd finally come to understand what it had been: a yearning for a way out, when actually what I had wanted to find was a way in."
1324,"If, as a culture, we don’t bear witness to grief, the burden of loss is placed entirely upon the bereaved, while the rest of us avert our eyes and wait for those in mourning to stop being sad, to let go, to move on, to cheer up. And if they don’t — if they have loved too deeply, if they do wake each morning thinking, I cannot continue to live — well, then we pathologize their pain; we call their suffering a disease. We do not help them: we tell them that they need to get help."
1325,
1326,Old breed? New breed? There's not a damn bit of difference so long as it's the Marine breed.
1327,"So they've got us surrounded, good! Now we can fire in any direction, those b*****ds won't get away this time!"
1328,We're surrounded. That simplifies the problem!
1329,"Take me to the Brig. I want to see the ""real Marines""."
1330,I want to go where the guns are!
1331,There are not enough chinamen in the world to stop a fully armed Marine regiment from going where ever they want to go.

1340,Every woman is just a different kind of problem.
1341,Recycling and speed limits are bullshit. They're like someone who quits smoking on his deathbed.
1342,
1343,
1344,"Find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who calls you back when you hang up on him, who will lie under the stars and listen to your heartbeat, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep...wait for the boy who kisses your forehead, who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats, who holds your hand in front of his friends, who thinks you're just as pretty without makeup on. One who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares and how lucky his is to have you....The one who turns to his friends and says, 'that's her.'"
1345,Why do I do anything?' she says. 'I'm educated enough to talk myself out of any plan. To deconstruct any fantasy. Explain away any goal. I'm so smart I can negate any dream.
1346,"If you don't know what you want, you end up with a lot you don't."
1347,"You see, life only turns out good or bad for only a little bit. And then it turns out some other way."
1348,Your past is just a story. And once you realize this it has no power over you.
1349,
1350,"If you knew that your life was merely a phase or short, short segment of your entire existence, how would you live? Knowing nothing 'real' was at risk, what would you do? You'd live a gigantic, bold, fun, dazzling life. You know you would. That's what the ghosts want us to do - all the exciting things they no longer can."
1351,"Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it."

1353,"People don't listen, they just wait for their turn to talk."
1354,What do you do when your entire identity is destroyed in an instant? How do you cope when your whole life story turns out to bw wrong?
1355,"The one you love and the one who loves you are never, ever the same person."
1356,We can spend our lives letting the world tell us who we are. Sane or insane. Saints or sex addicts. Heroes or victims. Letting history tell us how good or bad we are. Letting our past decide our future. Or we can decide for ourselves. And maybe it's our job to invent something better.
1357,The difference between how you look and how you see yourself is enough to kill most people. And maybe the reason vampires don’t die is because they can never see themselves in photographs or mirrors.
1358,People are all over the world telling their one dramatic story and how their life has turned into getting over this one event. Now their lives are more about the past than their future.
1359,
1360,
1361,
1362,"I don't look at my life too much. I'm always looking forward, not backward."
1363,Participating in a gun buy-back program because you think that criminals have too many guns is like having yourself castrated because you think your neighbors have too many kids.

1366,You have to be realistic about where you are in life and enjoy it.
1367,"Improvise, Adapt and Overcome!"
1368,"You're as young as you feel. As young as you want to be. There's an old saying I heard from a friend of mine. People ask him, ""Why do you look so good at your age?"" He'll say, ""Because I never let the old man in."" And there's truth to that. It's in your mind, how far you let him come in."
1369,I've never met a genius. A genius to me is someone who does well at something he hates. Anybody can do well at something he loves - it's just a question of finding the subject.

1371,They say marriages are made in Heaven. But so is thunder and lightning.

1373,"Opinions are like a**holes, everybody has one."
1374,"If you want a guarantee, buy a toaster."
1375,"Secretly everybody's getting tired of political correctness, kissing up. That's the kiss-ass generation we're in right now. We're really in a pussy generation. Everybody's walking on eggshells. We see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff. When I grew up, those things weren't called racist."
1376,"I am not a regret type person. I don't believe in regrets. Lots of things you would do differently if you'd do it again, but you don't do it again, so you don't think about it. But that goes for life in general. You're only dealing with the knowledge you have at that time."
1377,"Maybe I`m getting to the age when I`m starting to be senile or nostalgic or both, but people are so angry now. You used to be able to disagree with people and still be friends.

1399,"Beauty Should Begin in the Heart and Soul, otherwise cosmetics are useless."
1400,"You cannot keep up a nightlife and amount to anything in the day. You cannot indulge in those foods and liquors that destroy the physique and still hope to have a physique that functions with the minimum of destruction to itself. A candle burnt at both ends may shed a brighter light, but the darkness that follows is for a longer time."
1401,You live but once; you might as well be amusing.

1407,"Sin can be forgiven, but stupid is forever."
1408,A woman does not become interesting until she is over 40.
1409,
1410,Leadership is solving problems. The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help or concluded you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership.
1411,"1. It ain't as bad as you think. It will look better in the morning.
2. Get mad, then get over it.

1416,"Never receive counsel from unproductive people. Never discuss your problems 
 with someone incapable of contributing to the solution, because those who 
 never succeed themselves are always first to tell you how. Not everyone has 
 a right to speak into your life. You are certain to get the worst of the 
 bargain when you exchange ideas with the wrong person. Don't follow anyone 
 who's not going anywhere."
1417,
1418,"When we are debating an issue, loyalty means giving me your honest opinion, whether you think I'll like it or not. Disagreement, at this state, stimulates me. But once a decision is made, the debate ends. From that point on, loyalty means executing the decision as if it were your own."
1419,"Good leaders set vision, missions, and goals.  Great leaders inspire every follower at every level to internalize their purpose, and to understand that their purpose goes far beyond the mere details of their job.  When everyone is united in purpose, a positive purpose that serves not only the organization but also, hopefully, the world beyond it, you have a winning team."
1420,"The less you associate with some people, the more your life will improve. Any time you tolerate mediocrity in others, it increases your mediocrity. An important attribute in successful people is their impatience with negative thinking and negative acting people."
1421,"Don't just show kindness in passing or to be courteous.  Show it in depth, show it with passion, and expect nothing in return.  Kindness is not just about being nice; it's about recognizing another human being who deserves care and respect."

1423,Always do your best. Somebody is watching you.
1424,"Treat people kindly. When you are kind to somebody and I don't mean necessarily ""buddy-buddy"", just show kindness and consideration. Show that people are worthy and you respect them and you are glad they're with you."

1426,"We have to start thinking of America as a family. We have to stop screeching screeching at each other, stop hurting each other, and instead start caring for, sacrificing for and sharing with each other ... We cannot move forward if cynics and critics swoop down and pick apart anything that goes wrong, to a point where we lose sight of what is right, decent and uniquely good about America."
1427,"You can never err by treating everyone in the building with respect, thoughtfulness, and a kind word.  Everyone of our employees is an essential employee.  Every one of them wants to be viewed that way.  And if you treat them that way, they will view you that way.  They will not let you down or let you fail.  They will accomplish whatever you have put in front of them."
1428,Trying to get everyone to like you is a sign of mediocrity.
1429,
1430,"Look for intelligence and judgment and, most critically, a capacity to anticipate, to see around corners. Also look for loyalty, integrity, a high energy drive, a balanced ego and the drive to get things done."
1431,
1432,One of the greatest talents of all is the talent to recognize and to develop talent in others.

They will realize that your decision must be necessary, and is not arbitrary or without empathy.  As the old saying puts it, 'To the world, you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.'"
1434,
1435,In old days men studied for the sake of self-improvement; nowadays men study in order to impress other people.

1457,Of course you want to be rich and famous. It's natural. Wealth and fame are what every man desires. The question is: What are you willing to trade for it?
1458,"If you chase two rabbits, 
 you catch none."
1459,
1460,"Worrying is carrying tomorrow's load with today's strength- carrying two days at once. It is moving into tomorrow ahead of time. Worrying doesn't empty tomorrow of its sorrow, it empties today of its strength."
1461,
1462,"The wonderful thing about praying is that you leave a world of not being able to do something, and enter God’s realm where everything is possible. He specializes in the impossible. Nothing is too great for His almighty power. Nothing is too small for His love."
1463,
1464,"When a train goes through a tunnel and it gets dark, you don't throw away the ticket and jump off. You sit still and trust the engineer."

1469,"You can never learn that Christ is all you need, until Christ is all you have."
1470,Forgiveness is the key that unlocks the door of resentment and the handcuffs of hatred. It is a power that breaks the chains of bitterness and the shackles of selfishness.
1471,

1473,"I prayed to dispel my fear, until suddenly, and I do not know how the idea came to me, I began to pray for others. I prayed for everyone who came into my thoughts - - people with whom I had traveled, those who had been in prison with me, my school friends of years ago. I do not know how long I continued my prayer, but this I do know - - my fear was gone! Interceding for others had released me!"
1474,Happiness isn't something that depends on our surroundings... It's something we make inside ourselves.

1479,"If the devil cannot make us bad, he will make us busy."
1480,"When we are on the beach we only see a small part of the ocean. However, we know that there is much more beyond the horizon. We only see a small part of God's great love, a few jewels of His great riches, but we know that there is much more beyond the horizon. The best is yet to come, when we see Jesus face-to-face."

1482,Forgiveness is not an emotion; it is an act of the will.
1483,"Do you know what hurts so very much? It's love. Love is the strongest force in the world, and when it is blocked that means pain. There are two things we can do when this happens.

1487,"Don't ever mistake my silence for ignorance, my calmness for acceptance or my kindness for weakness. Compassion and tolerance are not a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength."
1488,"Man surprised me most about humanity.Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health.And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived."

I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart out to others; to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. I am going to have kind thoughts towards others, I am not going to get angry or think badly about others. I am going to benefit others as much as I can."

1495,"Whether one is rich or poor, educated or illiterate, religious or nonbelieving, man or woman, black, white, or brown, we are all the same. Physically, emotionally, and mentally, we are all equal. We all share basic needs for food, shelter, safety, and love. We all aspire to happiness and we all shun suffering. Each of us has hopes, worries, fears, and dreams. Each of us wants the best for our family and loved ones. We all experience pain when we suffer loss and joy when we achieve what we seek. On this fundamental level, religion, ethnicity, culture, and language make no difference."
1496,"If it can be solved, there's no need to worry, and if it can't be solved, worry is of no use."
1497,"Don't be a person of success, be a person of value."
1498,
1499,Forget the failures. Keep the lessons.

1501,The true hero is one who conquers his own anger and hatred.
1502,"Pain can change you, but that doesn't mean it has to be a bad change. Take that pain and turn it into wisdom."
1503,
1504,"This is my simple religion. There is no need for temples; no need for complicated philosophy. Our own brain, our own heart is our temple; the philosophy is kindness."
1505,Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible.
1506,Remember that sometimes not getting what you want is a wonderful stroke of luck.
1507,
1508,"We often add to our pain and suffering by being overly sensitive, over-reacting to minor things, and sometimes taking things too personally."
1509,"Take charge of your attitude. 
 Don't let someone else choose it for you."
1510,Abilities wither under criticism; they blossom under encouragement.
1511,"There are four ways, and only four ways, in which we have contact with the world. We are evaluated and classified by these four contacts: what we do, how we look, what we say, and how we say it."
1512,"If we think happy thoughts, we will be happy. If we think miserable thoughts, we will be miserable."
1513,Improving yourself is a lot more profitable than trying to improve others.
1514,The only way on Earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.
1515,You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.
1516,"Remember, today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday."
1517,Knowledge isn’t power until it is applied.
1518,
1519,"Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain - and most fools do. But it takes character and self control to be understanding and forgiving."
1520,
1521,"If you do something for someone else, never remember. If someone does something for you, never forget."
1522,"If you are not in the process of becoming the person you want to be, you are automatically engaged in becoming the person you don't want to be."
1523,Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage.
1524,The world is filled with interesting things to do. Don't lead a dull life in such a thrilling world.
1525,"An old man was asked what had robbed him of joy in his life. His reply was, ""Things that never happened."""
1526,"If you want to be a good conversationalist, be a good listener. To be interesting, be interested."
1527,"Remember, happiness doesn't depend upon who you are or what you have; it depends solely upon what you think. So start each day by thinking of all the things you have to be thankful for. Your future will depend very largely on the thoughts you think today. So think thoughts of hope and confidence and love and success."
1528,Don't be afraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.
1529,Do the thing you fear to do and keep on doing it... that is the quickest and surest way ever yet discovered to conquer fear.

1532,"When we have accepted the worst, we have nothing more to lose.  And that automatically means we have everything to gain."
1533,
1534,
1535,The most important thing in your life is not what you do; it's who you become. That's what you will take into eternity.
1536,"We don't believe something by merely saying we believe it, or even when we believe that we believe it. We believe something when we act as if it were true."
1537,"The greatest issue facing the world today, with all its heartbreaking needs, is whether those who, by profession or culture, are identified as ‘Christians’ will become disciples – students, apprentices, practitioners – of Jesus Christ, steadily learning from him how to live the life of the Kingdom of the Heavens into every corner of human existence."
1538,
1539,A disciple is a person who has decided that the most important thing in their life is to learn how to do what Jesus said to do.
1540,Ruthlessly eliminate hurry from your life.
1541,The main thing God gets out of your life is not the achievements you accomplish. It's the person you become.

1543,The first act of love is always the giving of attention.
1544,The ultimate freedom we have as human beings is the power to select what we will allow or require our minds to dwell upon.
1545,"Consumer Christianity is now normative. The consumer Christian is one who utilizes the grace of God for forgiveness and the services of the church for special occasions, but does not give his or her life and innermost thoughts, feelings, and intentions over to the kingdom of the heavens. Such Christians are not inwardly transformed and not committed to it."
1546,"Every church needs to be able to answer two questions. First, what is our plan for making disciples? And second, does our plan work?"
1547,
1548,"If we do not make formation in Christ the priority, then we're just going to keep on producing Christians that are indistinguishable in their character from many non-Christians."
1549,"A disciple is a learner, a student, an apprentice – a practitioner… Disciples of Jesus are people who do not just profess certain views as their own but apply their growing understanding of life in the Kingdom of the Heavens to every aspect of their life on earth."

1554,"The will is transformed by experience, not information."
1555,
1556,"What Paul is clearly saying is that if anyone is worthy of being saved, they will be saved. At that point many Christians get very anxious, saying that absolutely no one is worthy of being saved. The implication of that is that a person can be almost totally good, but miss the message about Jesus, and be sent to hell. What kind of a God would do that? I am not going to stand in the way of anyone whom God wants to save. I am not going to say 'he can't save them.' I am happy for God to save anyone he wants in any way he can. It is possible for someone who does not know Jesus to be saved."
1557,"As Augustine say clearly, God being God offends human pride. If God is running the universe and has first claim on our lives, guess who isn't running the universe and does not get to have things as they please."
1558,"Jesus, Willard says, “does not call us to do what he did, but to be as he was, permeated with love. Then the doing of what he did and said becomes the natural expression of who we are in him."
1559,
1560,You don't have to control your thoughts; you just have to stop letting them control you.
1561,"Every positive change - every jump to a higher level of energy and awareness - involves a rite of passage. Each time to ascend to a higher rung on the ladder of personal evolution, we must go through a period of discomfort, of initiation. I have never found an exception."
1562,"Life comes at us in waves. We can't predict or control those waves, but we can learn to surf"
1563,Dream big. Start small and then connect the dots
1564,"There are no mistakes, only lessons.
If you don't learn the lesson the first time, they get harder."
1565,Choice means giving up something you want for something else you want more.
1566,Life is a series of moments. The quality of attention and action that we bring to each moment determines the quality of our lives.
1567,"While some of us act without thinking, too many of us think without acting."
1568,"Where are you? Here
What time is it? Now
What are you? This moment."
1569,"Faith means living with uncertainty - feeling your way through life, letting your heart guide you like a lantern in the dark."
1570,The journey is what brings us happiness not the destination.
1571,"Wake up! If you knew for certain you had a terminal illness--if you had little time left to live--you would waste precious little of it! Well, I'm telling you...you do have a terminal illness: It's called birth. You don't have more than a few years left. No one does! So be happy now, without reason--or you will never be at all."
1572,"Surrender means accepting this moment, this body, and this life with open arms. Surrender involves getting out of your own way and living in accord with a higher will, expressed as the wisdom of the heart. Far more than passive acceptance, surrender uses every challenge as a means of spiritual growth and expanded awareness."
1573,"The secret of change consists in concentrating one's energy to create the new, and not to fight against the old."
1574,The universe does not judge us; it only provides consequences and lessons and opportunities to balance and learn through the law of cause and effect. Compassion is the recognition that we are each doing the best we can within the limits of our current beliefs and capacities.
1575,"We are both burdened and blessed by the great responsibility of the will - the power of choice. Our future is determined, in large part, by the choices we make now. We cannot always control our circumstances, but we can and do choose our response to whatever arises. Reclaiming the power of choice, we find the courage to live fully in the world."
1576,There is no path to Happiness. Happiness is the path. There is no path to Love. Love is the path. There is no path to Peace. Peace is the path.
1577,Stress happens when your mind resists what is...The only problem in your life is your mind's resistance to life as it unfolds.
1578,"If you don't get what you want, you suffer; if you get what you don't want, you suffer; even when you get exactly what you want, you still suffer because you can't hold on to it forever."
1579,"Your fears are not walls, but hurdles. Courage is not the absence of fear, but the conquering of it."
1580,The seasons do not push one another; neither do clouds race the wind across the sky. All things happen in their own good time.
1581,"If babies held the same tendency toward self-criticism as adults, they might never learn to walk or talk. Can you imagine infants stomping, 'Aarggh! Screwed up again!' Fortunately, babies are free of self-criticism. They just keep practicing."
1582,"Ultimately, fear of failure generates a vicious circle that creates what is most feared. To break this cycle, you need to make peace with failure. It isn't enough to merely tolerate it; you need to appreciate the failure and use it."
1583,Everything you need to know is within you. Listen. Feel. Trust the body's wisdom.
1584,
1585,"Working hard is important. But there is something that matters even more, believing in yourself."
1586,You never want to be forced to do something. But the world around you starts to influence you in ways you never expected.
1587,"I meet hundreds of people, and I'm not going to remember them. But every single one of them will remember their interaction with me."
1588,"I'm very comfortable discussing my personal life, because it's so boring."
1589,There's no shame in enjoying the quiet life.
1590,Don't try too hard to be something you're not.
1591,There's never enough time to do nothing!
1592,"I'm not an easy person to love. There are lots of times when I'm a very good boyfriend, but there are times when I'm useless. I mean, I'm a mess around the house. I talk nonstop. I become obsessed with things."
1593,"I know I'm not a coal miner, but I do long hours and I never complain, and there is nowhere else I'd rather be. So, yeah, that's how I'd define myself. I want to do it right, and prove people wrong once and for all about the myth of child stars."
1594,"I will never, ever do a film as successful as the Harry Potter series. But neither will anyone else."
1595,"As much as I would love to be a person that goes to parties and has a couple of drinks and has a nice time - that doesn't work for me. I do that very unsuccessfully. I'd just rather sit at home and read, or go out to dinner with someone, or talk to someone I love, or talk to somebody that makes me laugh."
1596,"I used to be self conscious about my height, but then I thought, f*** that, I'm Harry Potter."
1597,"There's a lot of work that needs to be done, and there's a difference between talking the talk and walking the walk."
1598,"There is something inherently valuable about being a misfit. It's not to say that every person who has artistic talent was a social outcast, but there is definitely a value for identifying yourself differently and being proud that you are different."
1599,"I'm an atheist, but I'm very relaxed about it. I don't preach my atheism, but I have a huge amount of respect for people like Richard Dawkins who do."
1600,"Though I am not religious in the least, I am very proud to be Jewish."
1601,"I’m an atheist, and a militant atheist when religion starts impacting on legislation."
1602,"To the children who loved Harry Potter, I want to say your enthusiasm was the real magic. I so enjoyed being on the journey with you. And to the adults who bought the Harry Potter books and devoured them, I just want to say, those books were for children."
1603,You don't have to be gay to be a supporter- you just have to be a human.
1604,"If I die on a film set when I'm 80, I'll be happy with that."
1605,I don't want anyone to ever say that I don't belong where I am.
1606,"Well, I think I’m a feminist, just by the virtue of the fact that I believe in equal rights for everyone."
1607,What I learned is that acting is to a large extent about trying to stave off self-doubt long enough to be natural and real onstage.
1608,"I thought I was an actor playing a wizard. But really, I was a wizard playing an actor."
1609,
1610,"When you follow God's will for your life, you can see how yesterday's events prepared you for today's challenges and tomorrow's opportunities."
1611,"Prayer is the way you defeat the devil, reach the lost, restore a backslider, strengthen the saints, send missionaries out, cure the sick, accomplish the impossible, and know the will of God."
1612,This is a time when all of God's people need to keep their eyes and their Bibles wide open. We must ask God for discernment as never before.

1614,"When the problem is worry, the prescription is prayer."
1615,"We don't know what will happen tomorrow, but one thing is guaranteed-God's overarching care for His children. We can be sure enough of that. In a world where nothing is sure, He is sure."
1616,God is no further from you on your worst day than He is on your best day.  Just open your heart to receive Him and His love.
1617,"Don't wait until the moment of crisis. Plan ahead, hide God's Word in your heart, and pray in advance for victory, holiness, and a life pleasing to God."
1618,"If you are a Christian, your search for approval should be over."
1619,"Every time we deny ourselves in order to serve someone else, we grow in Christ."
1620,"When you're facing all the issues of life and you don't know what to do, accept the fact that you are human. We all are. We don't have the capacity to understand Almighty God. But you know what? We know Jesus Christ. He's the wisdom of God. And He put His Holy Spirit in us. So having access to the Holy Spirit and Jesus, we can face the challenges of today with the wisdom of God."
1621,God is never early and never late.
1622,The promises of God are His guarantees amid life's uncertainties. They're the basis of all our life of faith.
1623,Integrity is keeping a commitment even after circumstances have changed.
1624,Our attitude toward others reveals our genuine attitude toward God.
1625,"Answers to prayer have to be on God's schedule, not ours. He hears us pray, and He answers according to His will in His own time."
1626,We are to extend forgiveness to others in the same way that God did to us: Unconditionally.
1627,"Heaven is not a figment of imagination. It is not a feeling or an emotion. It is not the ""Beautiful Isle of Somewhere."" It is a prepared place for a prepared people."
1628,"Trust God for the impossible-miracles are His department. Our job is to do our best, letting the Lord do the rest."
1629,"If you are at a hard place in life, hesitant to ask for help, God invites you to ask Him so He can meet your need."
1630,"The Lord's Prayer reminds us that God longs for His people to communicate with Him, not just in church on Sunday, but wherever we are and whatever our need."
1631,We can embrace change by knowing we serve an unchanging God.
1632,God has given us everything we need for life and godliness. And he's given us the indwelling strength and guidance of the Holy Spirit. The rest is up to us.
1633,God’s grace is freely available but in order to receive it you have to realize you are lost without it.
1634,
1635,
1636,The human body has limitations. The human spirit is boundless.
1637,"The human body is capable of amazing physical deeds. If we could just free ourselves from our perceived limitations and tap into our internal fire, the possibilities are endless."
1638,"People think I'm crazy to put myself through such torture, though I would argue otherwise. Somewhere along the line we seem to have confused comfort with happiness... Dostoyevsky had it right: 'Suffering is the sole origin of consciousness.' Never are my senses more engaged than when the pain sets in. There is a magic in misery. Just ask any runner."
1639,"I run because if I didn’t, I’d be sluggish and glum and spend too much time on the couch. I run to breathe the fresh air. I run to explore. I run to escape the ordinary. I run…to savor the trip along the way. Life becomes a little more vibrant, a little more intense. I like that."
1640,"Even if you're inches away from the finish, never take success for granted."
1641,"A Marathon is not about running, it is about salvation. We spend so much of our lives doubting ourselves, thinking we're not good enough, not strong enough, not made of the right stuff. The Marathon is an opportunity for redemption. ""Opportunity,"" because the outcome is uncertain. ""Opportunity,"" because it is up to you, and only you, to make it happen; only you can turn your farfetched dream into a reality."
1642,"Listen to everyone, follow no one."
1643,"Don't run with your legs, run with your heart."
1644,"Unless you're not pushing yourself, you're not living to the fullest. You can't be afraid to fail, but unless you fail, you haven't pushed hard enough."""
1645,Any goal worth achieving involves an element of risk.
1646,"If you keep chasing your dreams, one day you'll catch them."
1647,Don't confuse comfort with happiness.
1648,"Most dreams die a slow death. They're conceived in a moment of passion, with the prospect of endless possibility, but often languish and are not pursued with the same heartfelt intensity as when first born. Slowly, subtly, a dream becomes elusive and ephemeral. People who've lost their own dreams become pessimists and cynics. They feel like the time and devotion spent on chasing their dreams were wasted. The emotional scars last forever."
1649,"Running is about finding your inner peace, and so is a life well lived."
1650,"Some seek the comfort of their therapist's office, other head to the corner pub and dive into a pint, but I chose running as my therapy."
1651,"I never feel more alive than when I'm in great pain, struggling against insurmountable odds and untold adversity. Hardship? Suffering? Bring it!"
1652,I run to breathe the fresh air. I run to explore. I run to escape the ordinary.
1653,"Once you permit yourself to compromise, you fail yourself."
1654,We have killed our souls with comfort instead of seeking fulfillment and achievement.
1655,"I wasn't born with any innate talent. I've never been naturally gifted at anything. I always had to work at it. The only way I knew how to succeed was to try harder than anyone else. Dogged persistence is what got me through life. But here was something I was half-decent at. Being able to run great distances was the one thing I could offer the world. Others might be faster, but I could go longer. My strongest quality is that I never give up."
1656,"I run because long after my footprints fade away, maybe I will have inspired a few to reject the easy path, hit the trails, put one foot in front of the other, and come to the same conclusion I did: I run because it always takes me where I want to go."
1657,"Running unites us and brings us together because, in the words of the great Bill Rogers, ""We sweat the same. We struggle the same."" Running is a simple, primitive act, and therein lays its power. for it is one of the few commonalities left between us as a human race. Toeing the starting line of a marathon, regardless of the language you speak, the God you worship or the color of your skin, we all stand as equal. Perhaps the world would be a better place if more people ran."
1658,There is magic in misery. Just ask any runner.
1659,
1660,"Be happy for no reason, like a child. If you are happy for a reason, you’re in trouble, because that reason can be taken from you."
1661,"If you want to be happy, make someone else happy. If you want to find the right person in your life, be the right person. If you want to see change in the world, become the change you want to see."
1662,"You alone are the judge of your worth and your goal is to discover infinite worth in yourself, no matter what anyone else thinks."
1663,
1664,The best use of imagination is creativity. The worst use of imagination is anxiety.
1665,"If you are having the experience of anxiety, your body is making adrenaline and cortisone, if you are having the experience of tranquility, your body starts making valium, if you are having the experience of exhilaration and joy, your body makes interleukins and interferons which are powerful anti-cancer drugs. So, your body is constantly converting your experiences into molecules."
1666,There is a light within each of us that can never be diminished or extinguished. It can only be obscured by forgetting who we are
1667,The soul knows everything. Be who you are and your life will transform forever.
1668,"Each of us plays four roles in relation to the brain. We lead, we inspire, we invent, and we use it. Most people do not actively use their brains. They passively let their feelings and thoughts control their lives. They don't invent new ways to use their brains, either, settling instead for the same routine and repetitive thoughts every day. But if you master all four roles, you create your super brain. When you are the active observer of your feelings and thoughts, you become the user of your brain. Your super brain then serves you, not vice versa."
1669,You give to the world your greatest gift when you're being yourself.
1670,In every failure lies the seeds of success.
1671,"Whatever relationships you have attracted in your life at this moment, are precisely the ones you need in your life at this moment. There is a hidden meaning behind all events, and this hidden meaning is serving your own evolution."
1672,You must find the place inside yourself where nothing is impossible.
1673,"According to Vedanta, there are only two symptoms of enlightenment, just two indications that a transformation is taking place within you toward a higher consciousness. The first symptom is that you stop worrying. Things don't bother you anymore. You become light hearted and full of joy. The second symptom is that you encounter more and more meaningful coincidences in your life, more and more synchronicities. And this accelerates to the point where you actually experience the miraculous."
1674,Negative emotions are like unwelcome guests. Just because they show up on our doorstep doesn't mean they have a right to stay.
1675,"When you meet someone, you can silently send them a blessing, wishing them happiness, joy and laughter. This kind of silent giving is very powerful."
1676,
1677,All great changes are preceded by chaos.
1678,
1679,"If you want to reach a state of bliss, then go beyond your ego and the internal dialogue. Make a decision to relinquish the need to control, the need to be approved, and the need to judge. Those are the three things the ego is doing all the time. It's very important to be aware of them every time they come up."
1680,The universe has much bigger plans for you than you ever dreamed of for yourself.
1681,"The Ego, however, is not who you really are. The ego is your self-image; it is your social mask; it is the role you are playing. Your social mask thrives on approval. It wants control, and it is sustained by power, because it lives in fear."
1682,"When you make a choice, you change the future."
1683,"If you focus on success, you’ll have stress. But if you pursue excellence, success will be guaranteed."
1684,
1685,"Knighthood lies above eternity; it doesn’t live off fame, but rather deeds."
1686,"For a moment at least, be a smile on someone else's face."
1687,"They blossomed, they did not talk about blossoming."

Whispering from every leaf, 
Singing from every river, 
Shimmering from every sky."
1690,"It is beautiful to talk about beautiful things
And even more beautiful to silently gaze at them."
1691,To say more while saying less is the secret of being simple.
1692,"I am the shore and the ocean, awaiting myself on both sides."
1693,"The world is always open, Waiting to be discovered."
1694,"If you are good, they say you are weak."
1695,Life eats life to live.
1696,Either you will be you or you will not be at all.
1697,"To accomplish the perfect perfection, a little imperfection helps."
1698,I recreate myself; that is my only power.
1699,"When within yourself you find the road, the right road will open."
1700,Do not look too far for you will see nothing.
1701,"Whatever others may say, they say it to deceive and comfort themselves, not help you."
1702,The world cannot be translated; It can only be dreamed of and touched.
1703,"Everybody talks, but there is no conversation."
1704,Even great men bow before the Sun; it melts hubris into humility.

1710,Learn from the past and share your experiences with others.

1713,
1714,Nothing is more beautiful than a smile that has struggled through tears
1715,At the end of the day it doesn't matter what anybody else thinks as long as you're happy.
1716,"Your imperfections make you beautiful, they make you who you are."
1717,"Your mind . . . can be your best friend or your worst enemy, but it's your choice to make."
1718,Don't let anything or anyone define you. You are what you are because of what you make of tough situations in your life.
1719,
1720,"Don't judge me. You know my name, but not my story."
1721,Share your story with someone. You never know how one sentence of your life story could inspire someone to rewrite their own.
1722,"It's gonna be okay, no matter how hard your rock bottom is, you can rise above it and you can come back."
1723,Love yourself before any other person. That's when you can really survive on your own.
1724,"Whatever you dream of doing one day, don't give up on that dream because you never know where it can take you."
1725,You really need to be careful of who you hang out with and who you listen to. They can lead you down the wrong path.
1726,"No matter what you're going through, there's a light at the end of the tunnel and it may seem hard to get to it but you can do it and just keep working towards it and you'll find the positive side of things."
1727,Expectations are just disappointments waiting to happen.
1728,"Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground"
1729,"I think scars are like battle wounds - beautiful, in a way. They show what you've been through and how strong you are for coming out of it."
1730,Be proud of who you are.
1731,"I don't let anyone's insecurities, emotions, or opinions bother me. I know that if I am happy, that's all that matters to me."

1739,"Don't wait for an employer, friend, or mentor to show appreciation for your work. Take pride in your own efforts on a daily basis."
1740,You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization.
1741,"Learn from the past, set vivid, detailed goals for the future,and live in the only moment of time over which you have any control: now."
1742,Losers take chances; winners make choices.
1743,The real risk is doing nothing.
1744,"Mistakes are painful when they happen, but years later a collection of mistakes is what is called experience."
1745,Life is the movie you see through your own eyes.
1746,
1747,"Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, or worn. It is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace & gratitude."
1748,"Change the changeable, accept the unchangeable, and remove yourself from the unacceptable."
1749,"There are two primary choices in life: to accept conditions as they exist, or accept the responsibility for changing them."
1750,Success is almost totally dependent upon drive and persistence.
1751,"You must look within for value,
but must look beyond for perspective."
1752,"All of the top achievers I know are life-long learners. Looking for new skills, insights, and ideas. If they're not learning, they're not growing and not moving toward excellence."
1753,"Accept yourself as you are right now; an imperfect, changing, growing and worthy person."

1755,"Chase your passion, not your pension."
1756,"Don't be a time manager, be a priority manager.  Cut your major goals into bite-sized pieces.  Each small priority or requirement on the way to ultimate goal become a mini goal in itself."
1757,Be willing to wait longer for you goals to bear fruit than you had anticipated.
1758,Stop stewing and start doing!
1759,
1760,
1761,

We all belong to this family, this human family, God's family."
1765,
1766,"One of the sayings in our country is Ubuntu - the essence of being human. Ubuntu speaks particularly about the fact that you can't exist as a human being in isolation. It speaks about our interconnectedness. You can't be human all by yourself, and when you have this quality - Ubuntu - you are known for your generosity. We think of ourselves far too frequently as just individuals, separated from one another, whereas you are connected and what you do affects the whole World. When you do well, it spreads out; it is for the whole of humanity."
1767,When the missionaries came to Africa they had the Bible and we had the land. They said 'Let us pray.' We closed our eyes. When we opened them we had the Bible and they had the land.

1771,The fundamental law of human beings is interdependence. A person is a person through other persons.
1772,"Africans believe in something that is difficult to render in English. We call it ubuntu, botho. It means the essence of being human. You know when it is there and when it is absent. It speaks about humaneness, gentleness, hospitality, putting yourself out on behalf of others, being vulnerable. It embraces compassion and toughness. It recognizes that my humanity is bound up in yours, for we can only be human together."
1773,"Our maturity will be judged by how well we are able to agree to disagree and yet continue to love one another, to care for one another, and cherish one another and seek the greater good of the other."
1774,"My father always used to say, ""Don't raise your voice. Improve your argument."""
1775,"Goodness is stronger than evil.
Love is stronger than hate.
Light is stronger than darkness.
Life is stronger than death.
Victory is ours through Him who loved us."
1776,"Religion is like a knife: you can either use it to cut bread, or stick in someone's back."
1777,Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning.
1778,To remain neutral in situations of injustice is to be complicit in that injustice.
1779,"Bringing people together is what i call 'ubuntu,' which means 'I am because we are.' Far too often people think of themselves as just individuals, separated from one another, whereas you are connected and what you do affects the whole world. When you do well, it spreads out; it is for the whole of humanity."
1780,"If we could but recognize our common humanity, that we do belong together, that our destinies are bound up in one another's, that we can be free only together, that we can be human only together, then a glorious world would come into being where all of us lived harmoniously together as members of one family, the human family."
1781,"There's no way in which you can ever win a war against terror. As long as there are conditions in many parts of the world that make people desperate: poverty, disease, ignorance, etc. I hope that we will discover soon, that we can survive, only together. We can prosper only together. And I think people are beginning to realize this, that you can't have pockets of prosperity in one part of the world and huge deserts of poverty and deprivation and think you can have a stable, secure world."
1782,"You don't choose your family. They are God's gift to you, as you are to them."
1783,If we are going to see real development in the world then our best investment is WOMEN!
1784,
1785,"No matter our circumstances, no matter our challenges or trials, there is something in each day to embrace and cherish. There is something in each day that can bring gratitude and joy if only we will see and appreciate it."
1786,The perfect place to begin is exactly where you are right now.
1787,You are stronger than you realize. You are more capable than you can imagine.
1788,"Don't think less of yourself, just think less about yourself."
1789,"Though we are incomplete, God loves us completely. Though we are imperfect, He loves us perfectly. Though we may feel lost and without compass, God's love encompasses us completely. ... He loves every one of us, even those who are flawed, rejected, awkward, sorrowful, or broken."
1790,"I do not believe in a God who would set up rules and commandments only to wait for us to fail so He could punish us. I believe in a Heavenly Father who is loving and caring and who rejoices in our every effort to stand tall and walk toward Him. Even when we stumble, He urges us not to be discouraged-never to give up or flee our allotted field of service-but to take courage, find our faith, and keep trying."
1791,"Sometimes we become so focused on the finish line, that we fail to find joy in the journey."
1792,"When it comes to hating, gossiping, ignoring, ridiculing, holding grudges, or wanting to cause harm, please apply the following: Stop it!"
1793,Doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith.
1794,"When our wagon gets stuck in the mud, God is much more likely to assist the man who gets out to push than the man who merely raises his voice in prayer—no matter how eloquent the oration."
1795,"Wherever you are, whatever your circumstances may be, you are not forgotten. No matter how dark your days may seem, no matter how insignificant you may feel, no matter how overshadowed you think you may be, your Heavenly Father has not forgotten you. In fact, He loves you with an infinite love."
1796,It is often in the trial of adversity that we learn those most critical lessons that form our character and shape our destiny.
1797,What we love determines what we seek. What we seek determines what we think and do. What we think and do determines who we are — and who we will become.
1798,"It is your reaction to adversity, not the adversity itself, that determines how your life’s story will develop."
1799,Don't let fear of failure discourage you. Don't let the voice of critics paralyze you - whether that voice comes from the outside or the inside.

1803,Never give up on anyone. And that includes not giving up on yourself.
1804,"The Lord doesn't expect us to work harder than we are able. He doesn't (nor should we) compare our efforts to those of others. Our Heavenly Father asks only that we do the best we can—that we work according to our full capacity, however great or small that may be."
1805,"By becoming the answer to someone's prayer, we often find the answer to our own."
1806,"The happiest people I know are not those who find their golden ticket; they are those who, while in pursuit of worthy goals, discover and treasure the beauty and sweetness of the everyday moments."
1807,"Yes, God loves you this very day and always. He is not waiting to love you until you have overcome your weaknesses and bad habits. He loves you today with a full understanding of your struggles. He is aware that you reach up to Him in heartfelt and hopeful prayer. He knows of the times you have held onto the fading light and believed-even in the midst of growing darkness. He knows of your sufferings. He knows of your remorse for the times you have fallen short or failed. And still He loves you."
1808,"True love requires action. We can speak of love all day long, we can write notes or poems that proclaim it, sing songs that praise it, and preach sermons that encourage it but until we manifest that love in action, our words are nothing but sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal."
1809,
1810,Silence in the face of evil is evil itself.
1811,Your life as a Christian should make non believers question their disbelief in God.

1813,"Salvation is free, but discipleship will cost you your life"
1814,Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act.
1815,The person who’s in love with their vision of community will destroy community. But the person who loves the people around them will create community everywhere they go.
1816,"Christianity stands or falls with its revolutionary protest against violence, arbitrariness and pride of power and with its plea for the weak. Christians are doing too little to make these points clear rather than too much. Christendom adjusts itself far too easily to the worship of power. Christians should give more offense, shock the world far more, than they are doing now. Christian should take a stronger stand in favor of the weak rather than considering first the possible right of the strong."
1817,"Cheap grace is the grace we bestow on ourselves. Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline, Communion without confession.... Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ, living and incarnate."
1818,"There is nothing that can replace the absence of someone dear to us, and one should not even attempt to do so. One must simply hold out and endure it. At first that sounds very hard, but at the same time it is also a great comfort. For to the extent the emptiness truly remains unfilled one remains connected to the other person through it. It is wrong to say that God fills the emptiness. God in no way fills it but much more leaves it precisely unfilled and thus helps us preserve -- even in pain -- the authentic relationship."
1819,Destruction of the embryo in the mother's womb is a violation of the right to live which God has bestowed upon this nascent life. To raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue. The simple fact is that God certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life. And that is nothing but murder.
1820,"May God in His mercy lead us through these times; but above all, may He lead us to Himself."
1821,The biggest mistake you can make in your life is to be always afraid of making a mistake.

1824,"We must be ready to allow ourselves to be interrupted by God, who will thwart our plans and frustrate our ways time and again, even daily, by sending people across our path with their demands and requests. We can, then, pass them by, preoccupied with our important daily tasks, just as the priest-perhaps reading the Bible-passed by the man who had fallen among robbers. When we do that, we pass by the visible sign of the Cross raised in our lives to show us that God’s way, and not our own, is what counts."
1825,The ultimate test of a moral society is the kind of world that it leaves to its children.
1826,"If you board the wrong train, it is no use running along the corridor in the other direction."
1827,"In me there is darkness, But with You there is light; I am lonely, but You do not leave me; I am feeble in heart, but with You there is help; I am restless, but with You there is peace. In me there is bitterness, but with You there is patience; I do not understand Your ways, But You know the way for me.” “Lord Jesus Christ, You were poor And in distress, a captive and forsaken as I am. You know all man’s troubles; You abide with me When all men fail me; You remember and seek me; It is Your will that I should know You And turn to You. Lord, I hear Your call and follow; Help me."
1828,Earthly possessions dazzle our eyes and delude us into thinking that they can provide security and freedom from anxiety. Yet all the time they are the very source of anxiety.
1829,"The deceit, the lie of the Devil consists of this, that he wishes to 
 make man believe that he can live without God's Word."
1830,"Cheap grace is the idea that ""grace"" did it all for me so I do not need to change my lifestyle. The believer who accepts the idea of ""cheap grace"" thinks he can continue to live like the rest of the world. Instead of following Christ in a radical way, the Christian lost in cheap grace thinks he can simply enjoy the consolations of his grace."
1831,We must be ready to allow ourselves to be interrupted by God.
1832,It is only with gratitude that life becomes rich!
1833,The church is not a religious community of worshippers of Christ but is Christ himself who has taken form among people.

1836,"Dream more, learn more, care more, and be more."
1837,"I never, ever get involved in politics. With politics you are not allowed to be honest. I don't have time to deal with that. I would rather work with kids."
1838,
1839,"I always just thought if you see somebody without a smile, give'em yours!"
1840,
1841,"We cannot direct the wind, but we can adjust the sails."

1844,
1845,"Smile, it enhances your face value."
1846,"If you don't like the road you're walking, start paving another one."
1847,"I always had a very open mind and a very open heart. I always look for the good in everybody and the God in everybody. I play to that. And I just love people. I love the difference in people. I love getting to know people. I appreciate getting accepted myself, because I know I'm unusual. And I love the unusual in other people."
1848,Don't get so busy making a living that you forget to make a life.
1849,Storms make trees take deeper roots.
1850,"Understanding isn't learned from punishment and anger. An iron has no gentle touch, and love ain't learned from hate."
1851,"A great smile is a wonderful asset, but a good heart is pure gold."
1852,It's when you treat people like freaks that you become one yourself.
1853,What people do behind closed doors is certainly not my concern unless I'm there with them.
1854,"[On why she doesn't exercise:] If I tried to jog with these boobs, I'd end up with two black eyes."
1855,"If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader."
1856,"When someone shows you their true colors, believe them."
1857,I was the first woman to burn my bra - it took the fire department four days to put it out.
1858,
1859,
1860,
1861,
1862,"Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old only by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up interest wrinkles the soul. Worry, doubt, self-distrust, fear and despair;  these are the long, long years that bow the head and turn the growing spirit back to dust. Whatever your years, there is in every being's heart the love of wonder, the undaunted challenge of events, the unfailing childlike appetite for what next, and the joy and the game of life."
1863,History fails to record a single precedent in which nations subject to moral decay have not passed into political and economic decline. There has been either a spiritual awakening to overcome the moral lapse or a progressive deterioration leading to ultimate national disaster.
1864,Whoever said the pen is mightier than the sword obviously never encountered automatic weapons.
1865,"Even when opportunity knocks, a man still has to get up off his seat and open the door."
1866,"Have a good plan, execute it violently, and do it today."
1867,
1868,
1869,No man is entitled to the blessings of freedom unless he be vigilant in its preservation.
1870,"Youth is not entirely a time of life; it is a state of mind. Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. You are as young as your faith, as old as your doubts; as young as your self-confidence, as old as your fear; as young as your hope, as old as your despair."
1871,"For those to whom much is given, much is required. It is not whether you get knocked down, it's whether you get up. There is no substitute for victory."
1872,Preparedness is the key to success and victory.
1873,"By profession I am a soldier and take pride in that fact. But I am prouder - infinitely prouder - to be a father. A soldier destroys in order to build; the father only builds, never destroys. The one has the potentiality of death; the other embodies creation and life. And while the hordes of death are mighty, the battalions of life are mightier still. It is my hope that my son, when I am gone, will remember me not from the battle field but in the home repeating with him our simple daily prayer, Our Father Who Art in Heaven."
1874,"The enemy is in front of us, the enemy is behind us, the enemy is to the right and to the left of us. They can't get away this time!"

1879,"I had learned one of the bitter lessons of life: never try to regain the past, the fire will have become ashes."
1880,We are not retreating - we are advancing in another direction.
1881,"Our government has kept us in a perpetual state of fear - kept us in a continuous stampede of patriotic fervor - with the cry of grave national emergency. Always there has been some terrible evil at home or some monstrous foreign power that was going to gobble us up if we did not blindly rally behind it by furnishing the exorbitant funds demanded. Yet, in retrospect, these disasters seem never to have happened, seem never to have been quite real."
1882,"Believe me, sir, never a night goes by, be I ever so tired, but I read the Word of God before I go to bed."
1883,"The issues which today confront the nation are clearly defined and so fundamental as to directly involve the very survival of the Republic. Are we going to preserve the religious base to our origin, our growth and our progress, or yield to the devious assaults of atheistic or other anti-religious forces? Are we going to maintain our present course toward State Socialism with Communism just beyond or reverse the present trend and regain our hold upon our heritage of liberty and freedom?"

1885,"You're off to Great Places! Today is your day! Your mountain is waiting, So... get on your way!"
1886,"The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go."
1887,"Life's just one great journey. It's a road we travel as we go from point A to point B. What makes that journey worthwhile is the people we choose to travel with, the people we hold close as we take steps into the darkness and blindly make our way through life. They're the people who matter."

1891,You have to be odd to be number one.

1893,Why fit in when you were born to stand out?
1894,"You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own, and you know what you know. And you are the guy who'll decide where to go."
1895,"A life with love will have some thorns, but a life without love will have no roses. To the world, you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world."
1896,Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.
1897,"If you don't like me, remember it's mind over matter. 
I don't mind, and you don't matter."
1898,"I am lucky to be what I am! Thank goodness I'm not just a clam, or a ham, or a dusty jar of sour gooseberry jam! I am what I am - that's a great thing to be!"

1933,Pain makes you stronger. Fear makes you braver. Heartbreak makes you wiser.
1934,
1935,"Never let yourself be persuaded that any one Great Man, any one leader, is necessary to the salvation of America. When America consists of one leader and 158 million followers, it will no longer be America."
1936,"If a political party does not have its foundation in the determination to advance a cause that is right and that is moral, then it is not a political party; it is merely a conspiracy to seize power."

1940,"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at all in any true sense. Under the clouds of war, it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron."
1941,The supreme quality of leadership is integrity.
1942,"No one should ever sit in this office over 70 years old, and that I know."
1943,"In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.

It’s very rare for a relationship to withstand the Earth’s gravitational pull and where it’s going to take people and how they’re going to grow.

True, we are too poor to eliminate hunger; but in feeding one child, we protest against hunger.  True, we are too timid and powerless to take on all the guards of all the political prisons in the world; but in offering our solidarity to one prisoner we denounce all the tormentors.  True, we are powerless against death; but as long as we help one man, one woman, one child live one hour longer in safety and dignity, we affirm  man's [woman's] right to live."
2198,One person of integrity can make a difference.
2199,"The philosophers are wrong: it is not words that kill, it is silence."
2200,"The opposite of love is not hate, but indifference. Indifference creates evil. Hatred is evil itself. Indifference is what allows evil to be strong, what gives it power."
2201,Mankind must remember that peace is not God's gift to his creatures; peace is our gift to each other.
2202,"We are all teachers, or should be. Anyone who relays experience to another person is a teacher. Not to transmit your experience is to betray it."

2204,"There is much to be done, there is much that can be done... one person of integrity can make a difference."
2205,All collective judgments are wrong. Only racists make them. No human race is superior; no religious faith is inferior.
2206,
2207,"No human being is illegal. That is a contradiction in terms. Human beings can be beautiful or more beautiful, they can be fat or skinny, they can be right or wrong, but illegal? How can a human being be illegal?"
2208,I believe that all the survivors are mad. One time or another their madness will explode. You cannot absorb that much madness and not be influenced by it. That is why the children of survivors are so tragic. I see them in school. They don't know how
2209,
2210,"The way you keep your house, the way you organize your time, the care you take in your personal appearance, the things you spend your money on, all speak loudly about what you believe. The beauty of thy peace shines forth in an ordered life. A disordered life speaks loudly of disorder in the soul."
2211,Fear arises when we imagine that everything depends on us.
2212,Sometimes life is so hard you can only do the next thing.Whatever that is just do the next thing.God will meet you there.

2214,A whole lot of what we call 'struggling' is simply delayed obedience.
2215,"The secret is Christ in me, not me in a different set of circumstances."
2216,Today is mine. Tomorrow is none of my business. If I peer anxiously into the fog of the future I will strain my spiritual eyes so that I will not see clearly what is required of me now!
2217,God will not protect you from anything that will make you more like Jesus.
2218,It is always possible to be thankful for what is given rather than to complain about what is not given. One or the other becomes a habit of life.
2219,God never denies us our hearts desire except to give us something better.
2220,"God has promised to supply all our needs. What we don't have now, we don't need now."
2221,"Ordinary work, which is what most of us do, most of the time, is ordained by God every bit as much as is the extraordinary."
2222,The deepest lessons come out of the deepest waters and the hottest fires.
2223,"Faith is not an instinct. It certainly is not a feeling - feelings don't help much when you're in the lions' den or hanging on a wooden Cross. Faith is not inferred from the happy way things work. It is an act of will, a choice, based on the unbreakable Word of a God who cannot lie, and who showed us what love and obedience and sacrifice mean, in the person of Jesus Christ"
2224,"This job has been given to me to do. Therefore, it is a gift. Therefore, it is a privilege. Therefore, it is an offering I may make to God. Therefore, it is to be done gladly, if it is done for Him. Here, not somewhere else, I may learn God’s way. In this job, not in some other, God looks for faithfulness."

2233,"There is nothing worth living for, unless it is worth dying for."
2234,
2235,"The reality is that you will grieve forever. You will not ""get over"" the loss of a loved one; you will learn to live with it. You will heal and you will rebuild yourself around the loss you have suffered. You will be whole again but you will never be the same. Nor should you be the same nor would you want to."
2236,"Grief is real because loss is real. Each grief has its own imprint, as distinctive and as unique as the person we lost. The pain of loss is so intense, so heartbreaking, because in loving we deeply connect with another human being, and grief is the reflection of the connection that has been lost. We think we want to avoid the grief, but really it is the pain of the loss we want to avoid. Grief is the healing process that ultimately brings us comfort in our pain."
2237,"There are only two emotions: love and fear. All positive emotions come from love, all negative emotions from fear. From love flows happiness, contentment, peace, and joy. From fear comes anger, hate, anxiety and guilt. It's true that there are only two primary emotions, love and fear. But it's more accurate to say that there is only love or fear, for we cannot feel these two emotions together, at exactly the same time. They're opposites. If we're in fear, we are not in a place of love. When we're in a place of love, we cannot be in a place of fear."
2238,"People are like stained - glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within."

2241,
2242,"Whether you know it or not, one of the most important relationships in your life is with your Soul. Will you be kind and loving to your Soul, or will you be harsh and difficult? Many of us unknowingly damage our Souls with our negative attitudes and actions or by simple neglect. By making the relationship with your Soul an important part of your life, however, by honoring it in your daily routine, you give your life greater meaning and substance. Use your experiences-all of them-as opportunities to nourish your Soul!"
2243,"When life puts you through a tumbler, it's your choice whether you come out polished or crushed."
2244,"Death is but a transition from this life to another existence where there is no more pain and anguish. All the bitterness and disagreements will vanish, and the only thing that lives forever is love."
2245,"There are dreams of love, life, and adventure in all of us. But we are also sadly filled with reasons why we shouldn't try. These reasons seem to protect us, but in truth they imprison us. They hold life at a distance. Life will be over sooner than we think. If we have bikes to ride and people to love, now is the time."
2246,There is within each one of us a potential for goodness beyond our imagining; for giving which seeks no reward; for listening without judgment; for loving unconditionally.
2247,"It is very important that you only do what you love to do. you may be poor, you may go hungry, you may lose your car, you may have to move into a shabby place to live, but you will totally live. And at the end of your days you will bless your life because you have done what you came here to do. Otherwise, you will live your life as a prostitute, you will do things only for a reason, to please other people, and you will never have lived. and you will not have a pleasant death."
2248,"The opinion which other people have of you is their problem, not yours."
2249,"It is the denial of death that is partially responsible for people living empty, purposeless lives; for when you live as if you'll live forever, it becomes too easy to postpone the things you know that you must do."
2250,"We are living in a time of uncertainty, anxiety, fear, and despair. It is essential that you become aware of the light, power, and strength within each of you, and that you learn to use those inner resources in service of your own and others' growth."
2251,"To love means not to impose your own powers on your fellow man but offer him your help. And if he refuses it, to be proud that he can do it on his own strength."
2252,"You have to temper the iron. Every hardship is an opportunity that you are given, an opportunity to grow. To grow is the sole purpose of existence on this planet Earth. You will not grow if you sit in a beautiful flower garden, but you will grow if you are sick, if you are in pain, if you experience losses, and if you do not put your head in the sand, but take the pain as a gift to you with a very, very specific purpose."
2253,"It's only when we truly know and understand that we have a limited time on earth - and that we have no way of knowing when our time is up, we will then begin to live each day to the fullest, as if it was the only one we had."
2254,"We run after values that, at death, become zero. At the end of your life, nobody asks you how many degrees you have, or how many mansions you built, or how many Rolls Royces you could afford. That's what dying patients teach you."
2255,"We think sometimes we're only drawn to the good, but we're actually drawn to the authentic. We like people who are real more than those who hide their true selves under layers of artificial niceties"
2256,"When we face the worst that can happen in any situation, we grow. When circumstances are at their worst, we can find our best."
2257,"You may not get what you want, but God always gives you what you need."

2291,"The resting place of the mind is the heart. The only thing the mind hears all day is clanging bells and noise and argument, and all it wants is quietude. The only place the mind will ever find peace is inside the silence of the heart. That's where you need to go."
2292,Tis' better to live your own life imperfectly than to imitate someone else's perfectly.
2293,"If you're brave enough to leave behind everything familiar and comforting, which can be anything from your house to bitter, old resentments, and set out on a truth-seeking journey, either externally or internally, and if you are truly willing to regard everything that happens to you on that journey as a clue and if you accept everyone you meet along the way as a teacher and if you are prepared, most of all, to face and forgive some very difficult realities about yourself, then the truth will not be withheld from you."
2294,The world is like a dropped pie most of the time. Don't kill yourself trying to put it back together. Just grab a fork and eat some of it off the floor. Then carry on.

2296,the only thing you need to do for now is get some rest and take good care of yourself until you do know the answer
2297,"Creativity itself doesn't care at all about results - the only thing it craves is the process. Learn to love the process and let whatever happens next happen, without fussing too much about it. Work like a monk, or a mule, or some other representative metaphor for diligence. Love the work. Destiny will do what it wants with you, regardless."
2298,Mistakes will be made. Failure will occur. You pick yourself up and carry on.
2299,"Everything good I've ever gotten in life, I only got because I gave something else up."

2303,"A true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life."
2304,"There is so much about my fate that I cannot control, but other things do fall under the jurisdiction. I can decide how I spend my time, whom I interact with, whom I share my body and life and money and energy with. I can select what I can read and eat and study. I can choose how I'm going to regard unfortunate circumstances in my life-whether I will see them as curses or opportunities. I can choose my words and the tone of voice in which I speak to others. And most of all, I can choose my thoughts."

2316,It's our challenges and obstacles that give us layers of depth and make us interesting.
2317,"Here are the values that I stand for: honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values."
2318,"Life is about balance. The good and the bad. The highs and the lows. The thing everyone should realize is that the key to happiness is being happy by yourself and for yourself. Happiness comes from within. You have the power to change your own mindset so that all the negative, horrible thoughts that try to invade your psyche are replaced with happy, positive, wonderful thoughts."
2319,Sometimes you can't see yourself clearly until you see yourself through the eyes of others.

Keep doing it even if people are passing you on the street saying, ""I can't tell if that person is laughing or crying, but either way they seem crazy, let's walk faster."" Emote. It's okay. It shows you are thinking and feeling."

2328,"Gratitude is looking on the brighter side of the life, even if it means hurting your eyes."
2329,"The definition of success changes. Success is to live your life with integrity and not give in to peer pressure to be something you're not. Follow your passion, stay true to yourself, never follow someone else's path; unless you're in the woods and you're lost and you see a path, then by all means, you should follow that."

2363,"When something happens, the only thing in your power is your attitude toward it. It is not the things that disturb us, but our interpretation of their significance. Things and people are not what we wish them to be nor are they what they seem to be. They are what they are."

2386,"Do you want me to tell you something really subversive? Love is everything it's cracked up to be. That's why people are so cynical about it. It really is worth fighting for, being brave for, risking everything for. And the trouble is, if you don't risk anything, you risk even more."

2397,"What I would like to give my daughter is freedom. And this is something that must be given by example, not exhortation. Freedom is a loose leash, license to be different from your mother and still be loved...Freedom is...not insisting that your daughter share your limitations. Freedom also means letting your daughter reject you when she needs to and come back when she needs to. Freedom is unconditional love."
2398,Ambivalence is a wonderful tune to dance to. It has a rhythm all its own.

2415,"Love isn't something natural. Rather it requires discipline, concentration, patience, faith, and the overcoming of narcissism. It isn't a feeling, it is a practice."
2416,An illusion shared by everyone becomes a reality.
2417,"If other people do not understand our behavior-so what? Their request that we must only do what they understand is an attempt to dictate to us. If this is being 'asocial' or 'irrational' in their eyes, so be it. Mostly they resent our freedom and our courage to be ourselves. We owe nobody an explanation or an accounting, as long as our acts do not hurt or infringe on them."

2420,"Many psychiatrists and psychologists refuse to entertain the idea that society as a whole may be lacking in sanity. They hold that the problem of mental health in a society is only that of the number of 'unadjusted' individuals, and not of a possible unadjustment of the culture itself."
2421,"To love somebody is not just a strong feeling - it is a decision, it is a judgment, it is a promise."
2422,"Paradoxically, the ability to be alone is the condition for the ability to love."
2423,The danger of the past was that men became slaves. The danger of the future is that man may become robots.
2424,Hate is a product of the unfulfilled life.
2425,There is no meaning to life except the meaning man gives his life by the unfolding of his powers.
2426,"We are not on the way to greater individualism, but are becoming an increasingly manipulated mass civilization."
2427,"When people can't handle God any more, they turn to religion."
2428,"A society whose principles are acquisition, profit, and property produces a social character oriented around having, and once the dominant pattern is established, nobody wants to be an outsider, or indeed an outcast; in order to avoid this risk everybody adapts to the majority, who have in common only their mutual antagonism."
2429,"The affirmation of one's own life, happiness, growth and freedom, is rooted in one's capacity to love."
2430,"As we ascend the social ladder, viciousness wears a thicker mask."
2431,"The deepest need of the human being is to overcome our
separateness, to leave the prison of our loneliness."
2432,"Happiness does not exclude sadness - if a person responds to life, he's sometimes happy and sometimes sad. What matters is he responds."
2433,"Respect is not fear and awe; it...[is]the ability to see a person as he is, to be aware of his unique individuality. Respect, thus, implies the absence of exploitation. I want the loved person to grow and unfold for his own sake, and in his own ways, and not for the purpose of serving me."
2434,
2435,Life breaks all of us but some of us get stronger in the broken places.
2436,"Before you react, think. Before you spend, earn. Before you criticize, wait. Before you quit, try."
2437,
2438,"The best people possess a feeling for beauty, the courage to take risks, the discipline to tell the truth, the capacity for sacrifice. Ironically, their virtues make them vulnerable; they are often wounded, sometimes destroyed."
2439,"I love you for all that you are, all that you have been, all that you're yet to be."
2440,Critics are men who watch a battle from a high place then come down and shoot the survivors.
2441,"Night is always darker before the dawn and life is the same, the hard times will pass, every thing will get better and sun will shine brighter then ever."
2442,"Try to learn to breathe deeply, really to taste food when you eat, and when you sleep, really to sleep. Try as much as possible to be wholly alive with all your might, and when you laugh, laugh like hell. And when you get angry, get good and angry. Try to be alive. You will be dead soon enough."
2443,The first panacea for a mismanaged nation is inflation of the currency; the second is war. Both bring a temporary prosperity; both bring a permanent ruin. But both are the refuge of political and economic opportunists.
2444,But man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed but not defeated.
2445,"Be fully in the moment,open yourself to the powerful energies dancing around you."
2446,
2447,"The most painful thing is losing yourself in the process of loving someone too much, and forgetting that you are special too."
2448,
2449,"Worry a little bit every day and in a lifetime you will lose a couple of years. If something is wrong, fix it if you can. But train yourself not to worry: Worry never fixes anything."

2455,The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them.
2456,I like to listen. I have learned a great deal from listening carefully. Most people never listen.
2457,"Go all the way with it. Do not back off. For once, go all the goddamn way with what matters."
2458,"Any man's life, told truly, is a novel."
2459,
2460,"Feelings are great liars. If Christians worshipped only when they felt like it, there would be precious little worship. We think that if we don’t feel something there can be no authenticity in doing it. But the wisdom of God says something different: that we can act ourselves into a new way of feeling much quicker than we can feel ourselves into a new way of acting. Worship is an act that develops feelings for God, not a feeling for God that is expressed in an act of worship."
2461,"O God, when my faith gets overladen with dust, blow it clean with the wind of your Spirit. When my habits of obedience get stiff and rusty, anoint them with the oil of your Spirit. Restore the enthusiasm of my first love for you."
2462,No life of faith can be lived privately. There must be overflow into the lives of others.
2463,"All the persons of faith I know are sinners, doubters, uneven performers. We are secure not because we are sure of ourselves but because we trust that God is sure of us."
2464,"The word 'christian' means different things to different people. To one person it means a stiff, upright, inflexible way of life, colorless and unbending. To another it means a risky, surprised-filled adventure, lived tiptoe at the edge of expectation...If we get our information from the biblical material, there is no doubt that the Christian life is a dancing, leaping, daring life."
2465,"The only opportunity you will ever have to live by faith is in the circumstances you are provided this very day: this house you live in, this family you find yourself in, this job you have been given, the weather conditions that prevail at the ...moment."
2466,"When we sin and mess up our lives, we find that God doesn't go off and leave us- he enters into our trouble and saves us."
2467,Prayer is the disciplined refusal to act before God acts.
2468,"One way to define spiritual life is getting so tired and fed up with yourself you go on to something better, which is following Jesus."
2469,"If you don't take a Sabbath, something is wrong. You're doing too much, you're being too much in charge. You've got to quit, one day a week, and just watch what God is doing when you're not doing anything."
2470,"Christians don't simply learn or study or use Scripture; we assimilate it, take it into our lives in such a way that it gets metabolized into acts of love, cups of cold water, missions into all the world, healing and evangelism and justice in Jesus' name, hands raised in adoration of the Father, feet washed in company with the Son."
2471,The life of faith is a daily exploration of the constant and countless ways in which Gods grace and love are expereinced
2472,"My job is not to solve people's problems or make them happy, but to help them see the grace operating in their lives."
2473,Wisdom is the art of living skillfully in whatever actual conditions we find ourselves.
2474,"This kingdom of God life is not a matter of waking up each morning with a list of chores or an agenda to be tended to, left on our bedside table by the Holy Spirit for us while we slept. We wake up already immersed in a large story of creation and covenant, of Israel and Jesus, the story of Jesus and the stories that Jesus told. We let ourselves be formed by these formative stories, and especially as we listen to the stories that Jesus tells, get a feel for the way he does it, the way he talks, the way he treats people, the Jesus way."
2475,"There are no experts in the company of Jesus. We are all beginners, necessarily followers, because we don’t know where we are going."
2476,"The way of Jesus cannot be imposed or mapped — it requires an active participation in following Jesus as he leads us through sometimes strange and unfamiliar territory, in circumstances that become clear only in the hesitations and questionings, in the pauses and reflections where we engage in prayerful conversation with one another and with him."
2477,"It is easier to find guides, someone to tell you what to do, than someone to be with you in a discerning, prayerful companionship as you work it out yourself. This is what spiritual direction is."
2478,"Love is not a word that describes my feelings; it is not a technique by which I fulfill my needs; it is not an ideal, abstract and pure, on which I meditate or discourse. It is acting in correspondence with or in response to God in relation to persons."
2479,People are not problems to be solved. They are mysteries to be explored.
2480,"Waiting means going about our assigned tasks, confident that God will provide the meaning and the conclusions."
2481,"Worship is an act that develops feelings for God, not a feeling for God that is expressed in an act of worship."
2482,"Go out into the world uncorrupted, a breath of fresh air in this squalid and polluted society. Provide people with a glimpse of good living and of the living God."
2483,"The hard work of sowing seed in what looks like perfectly empty earth has a time of harvest. All suffering, pain, emptiness, disappointment is seed: sow it in God and He will, finally, bring a crop of joy from it."
2484,
2485,"She was beautiful, but not like those girls in the magazines. She was beautiful, for the way she thought. She was beautiful, for the sparkle in her eyes when she talked about something she loved. She was beautiful, for her ability to make other people smile, even if she was sad. No, she wasn't beautiful for something as temporary as her looks. She was beautiful, deep down to her soul. She is beautiful."
2486,"To be kind is more important than to be right. Many times, what people need is not a brilliant mind that speaks but a special heart that listens."
2487,The world only exists in your eyes. You can make it as big or as small as you want
2488,"I hope you make the best of it. And I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life you're proud of. If you find that you're not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again."
2489,"You are the finest, loveliest, tenderest, and most beautiful person I have ever known—and even that is an understatement."
2490,"And in the end, we were all just humans...Drunk on the idea that love, only love, could heal our brokenness."
2491,Never confuse a single defeat with a final defeat.
2492,Intelligence is measured by a person's ability to see validity within both sides of contradicting arguments.
2493,"Suddenly she realized that what she was regretting was not the lost past but the lost future, not what had not been but what would never be."
2494,"Before you criticize others, remember, they may not have had the same opportunities in life as you have had"
2495,"...the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function. One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise. This philosophy fitted on to my early adult life, when I saw the improbable, the implausible, often the ""impossible,"" come true."
2496,You have a place in my heart no one else ever could have.
2497,"It was only a sunny smile, and little it cost in the giving, but like morning light it scattered the night and made the day worth living."
2498,Never confuse activity with action.
2499,There are all kinds of love in this world but never the same love twice.
2500,"The loneliest moment in someone’s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly."
2501,"Too much of anything is bad, but too much Champagne is just right."
2502,I never blame failure - there are too many complicated situations in life - but I am absolutely merciless toward lack of effort.
2503,Don't forget who you are and where you come from.
2504,Her philosophy is carpe diem for herself and laissez faire for others.
2505,"That is part of the beauty of all literature. You discover that your longings are universal longings, that you're not lonely and isolated from anyone. You belong."
2506,"You are mysterious, I love you. You’re beautiful, intelligent, and virtuous, and that’s the rarest known combination."
2507,I love her and that's the beginning and end of everything.
2508,"Well, you never knew exactly how much space you occupied in people's lives."
2509,
2510,"Success isn’t something that happens overnight: it’s a process. You have to nurture it along with continuous care, and the best way to do this is to have the right people working with you - not for you, but with you. I can dream alone and strive alone, but true success always requires the help and support of others."
2511,Do not let anyone tell you what you can be. Do not let anyone tell you that you are not good enough or smart enough. Remember that nobody is better than you. Everybody puts on their pants one leg at a time.
2512,"Never duck responsibility, its like running from the rain only to fall into the river."
2513,"The more we give, the more we receive. It's important to give back, because the seeds you plant today, you will harvest tomorrow."
2514,"In life we don't get what we want, we get in life what we are. If we want more we have to be able to be more, in order to be more you have to face rejection."
2515,"If you want to find what God put you here to do, ask yourself three questions. First question: What comes easy to you but harder to other people? The second question is: What would you do for years and never have to get paid for it? Third, ask yourself: How can you be of service?"
2516,Money doesn't change who you are; it magnifies who you really are.
2517,Comfort is the enemy of achievement.
2518,Inside every seed is the potential for an incredible harvest.
2519,"We have to learn to face our fears and push ourselves. If you're living on earth and you're not living on the edge, you're taking up too much room. When you push past the fear and realize that what you feared was not a big deal, you gain more confidence."
2520,"If you make too many things too public, then you end up living your life before the court of public opinion."
2521,Always define your area of excellence. Establish the area where you will be the best.
2522,Keep putting out good. It will come back to you tenfold in unexpected ways.
2523,"You know, you don't have to have money to be a successful businessperson. You don't need a college degree. You just need a lot of common sense backed up by a willingness to work hard."
2524,"I believe that my personal mission in life is to grow and contribute, so I am learning and growing every day."
2525,"My grandma used to make syrup for us because we couldn't afford it and I just played around with her recipe. I made strawberry syrup and that didn't really work out but I made strawberry-vanilla and that sold. Then I just went out and took marketing classes, went to seminars, learned about marketing a product and striking deals. It ended up taking orders of $1.5 million."
2526,I firmly believe that the two most important times in a person's life are when they are born and when they find out why they were born.
2527,"Money lets you enjoy the finer things of life, but it doesn't change who you are. It magnifies and brings into fruition the things that you want to hide most. It is a mask for insecurities as well."
2528,"When people listen to people like me, those of us who have a platform, we have to say things that speak truth. We have to empower, inspire, build, and launch the next generation of world solutions that will positively contribute to our economic, political and social fabric and - hopefully - improve the entire nation and the world."
2529,"Sometimes you're pushing and what you want to do is not coming with ease; doors are not opening. A lot of times we're pushing against resistance. If one looks closely, there is often a message in that resistance: ""Wait a minute, maybe it's not what you're supposed to be doing."""
2530,There are so many people living the best life money can buy. I want to slap some of these people. Some of these people you think are living the best life but they're not rich on the inside. I started this philosophy to be spiritual and be rich on the inside out.
2531,"We have to find areas in our lives that we feel most uncomfortable about and want to change. I decided to push myself because it allowed me to give back. I have a scholarship program. When I found out the average age of a homeless person is 9½ years old, I said there must be something that I can do. Now, I am the spokesman for the National Coalition for the Homeless."
2532,American economy is tricky. If you stay in the game you're in a good position for the upswing. If you're not in the game you can't win.
2533,"Money has not changed me. When I look at money, each dollar represents an option of something I could not do yesterday."
2534,
2535,You can be whatever you want to be. Don't let discouragement take you down.
2536,Respect depicts acceptance while disrespect is rejection.
2537,"Look from the blind man's eye.... You can paint the picture, the way you like about this world, so why not think positive and make this world more beautiful for yourself and others?"
2538,
2539,"Without language, thought is a vague, uncharted nebula."
2540,"The ultimate law of language is, dare we say, that nothing can ever reside in a single term. This is a direct consequence of the fact that linguistic signs are unrelated to what they designate and that, therefore, 'a' cannot designate anything without the the aid of 'b' and vice versa, or, in other words, that both have value only by the difference between them."
2541,Time changes all things; there is no reason why language should escape this universal law
2542,"I’m almost never serious, and I’m always too serious. Too deep, too shallow. Too sensitive, too cold hearted. I’m like a collection of paradoxes."
2543,A linguistic system is a series of differences of sound combined with a series of differences of ideas...
2544,"Speech has both an individual and a social side, and we cannot conceive of one without the other."
2545,Language furnishes the best proof that a law accepted by a community is a thing that is tolerated and not a rule to which all freely consent.
2546,"In the lives of individuals and societies, language is a factor of greater importance than any other. For the study of language to remain solely the business of a handful of specialists would be a quite unacceptable state of affairs."
2547,Written forms obscure our view of language. They are not so much a garment as a disguise.
2548,Psychologically our thought-apart from its expression in words-is only a shapeless and indistinct mass.
2549,"Nearly all institutions, it might be said, are based on signs, but these signs do not directly evoke things."
2550,A language presupposes that all the individual users possess the organs.
2551,"Within speech, words are subject to a kind of relation that is independent of the first and based on their linkage: these are syntagmatic relations, of which I have spoken."
2552,"Everyone, left to his own devices, forms an idea about what goes on in language which is very far from the truth."
2553,"Of all social institutions language is least amenable to initiative. It blends with the life of society, and the latter, inert by nature, is a prime conservative force."
2554,"Outside speech, the association that is made in the memory between words having something in common creates different groups, series, families, within which very diverse relations obtain but belonging to a single category: these are associative relations."
2555,"It is useful to the historian, among others, to be able to see the commonest forms of different phenomena, whether phonetic, morphological or other, and how language lives, carries on and changes over time."
2556,"It is only since linguistics has become more aware of its object of study, i.e. perceives the whole extent of it, that it is evident that this science can make a contribution to a range of studies that will be of interest to almost anyone."
2557,"Any psychology of sign systems will be part of social psychology - that is to say, will be exclusively social; it will involve the same psychology as is applicable in the case of languages."
2558,"Henceforth, language studies were no longer directed merely towards correcting grammar."
2559,"It is one of the aims of linguistics to define itself, to recognise what belongs within its domain. In those cases where it relies upon psychology, it will do so indirectly, remaining independent."
2560,"In fact, from then on scholars engaged in a kind of game of comparing different Indo-European languages with one another, and eventually they could not fail to wonder what exactly these connections showed, and how they should be interpreted in concrete terms."
2561,"Linguistics will have to recognise laws operating universally in language, and in a strictly rational manner, separating general phenomena from those restricted to one branch of languages or another."
2562,"The first of these phases is that of grammar, invented by the Greeks and carried on unchanged by the French. It never had any philosophical view of a language as such."
2563,
2564,"Nursing is an art: and if it is to be made an art, it requires an exclusive devotion as hard a preparation as any painter's or sculptor's work; for what is the having to do with dead canvas or dead marble, compared with having to do with the living body, the temple of God's spirit? It is one of the Fine Arts: I had almost said, the finest of Fine Arts."
2565,
2566,Live life when you have it. Life is a splendid gift-there is nothing small about it.
2567,
2568,Nursing is a progressive art such that to stand still is to go backwards.
2569,How very little can be done under the spirit of fear.
2570,
2571,"For us who Nurse, our Nursing is a thing, which, unless in it we are making progress every year, every month, every week, take my word for it we are going back. The more experience we gain, the more progress we can make."
2572,Nature alone cures. ... what nursing has to do ... is to put the patient in the best condition for nature to act upon him.
2573,Never underestimate the healing effects of beauty.
2574,"Live your life while you have it.  Life is a splendid gift.  There is nothing small in it.  For the greatest things grow by God's Law out of the smallest.  But to live your life you must discipline it.  You must not fritter it away in ""fair purpose, erring act, inconstant will"" but make your thoughts, your acts, all work to the same end and that end, not self but God.  That is what we call character."
2575,I think one's feelings waste themselves in words; they ought all to be distilled into actions which bring results.
2576,I am of certain convinced that the greatest heroes are those who do their duty in the daily grind of domestic affairs whilst the world whirls as a maddening dreidel.
2577,"Life is a hard fight, a struggle, a wrestling with the principle of evil, hand to hand, foot to foot. Every inch of the way is disputed. The night is given us to take breath, to pray, to drink deep at the fountain of power. The day, to use the strength which has been given us, to go forth to work with it till the evening."
2578,The very first requirement in a hospital is that it should do the sick no harm.
2579,"If I could give you information of my life it would be to show how a woman of very ordinary ability has been led by God in strange and unaccustomed paths to do in His service what He has done in her. And if I could tell you all, you would see how God has done all, and I nothing. I have worked hard, very hard, that is all; and I have never refused God anything."
2580,"Let whoever is in charge keep this simple question in her head (not, how can I always do this right thing myself, but) how can I provide for this right thing to be always done?"
2581,"The 'kingdom of heaven is within,' indeed, but we must also create one without, because we are intended to act upon our circumstances."
2582,"Jesus Christ raised women above the condition of mere slaves, mere ministers to the passions of the man, raised them by His sympathy, to be Ministers of God."
2583,Starting a job and working hard is how to be successful.
2584,"May we hope that, when we are all dead and gone, leaders will arise who have been personally experienced in the hard, practical work, the difficulties, and the joys of organizing nursing reforms, and who will lead far beyond anything we have done!"
2585,The next Christ will perhaps be a female Christ.
2586,Unnecessary noise is the most cruel abuse of care which can be inflicted on either the sick or the well.
2587,For the sick it is important to have the best.
2588,
2589,Hang in there. It is astonishing how short a time it can take for very wonderful things to happen.
2590,"If you look the right way, you can see that the whole world is a garden."
2591,As long as you have a garden you have a future and as long as you have a future you are alive.
2592,Everything's a story - You are a story -I am a story.
2593,"How it is that animals understand things I do not know, but it is certain that they do understand. Perhaps there is a language which is not made of words and everything in the world understands it. Perhaps there is a soul hidden in everything and it can always speak, without even making a sound, to another soul."
2594,"At first people refuse to believe that a strange new thing can be done, then they begin to hope it can be done, then they see it can be done--then it is done and all the world wonders why it was not done centuries ago."
2595,Two worst things as can happen to a child is never to have his own way - or always to have it.
2596,"When a man looks at the stars, he grows calm and forgets small things. They answer his questions and show him that his earth is only one of the million worlds. Hold your soul still and look upward often, and you will understand their speech. Never forget the stars."
2597,"Everything is made out of Magic, leaves and trees, flowers and birds, badgers and foxes and squirrels and people. So it must be all around us. In this garden-in all the places."
2598,Perhaps there is a language which is not made of words and everything in the world understands it.
2599,"If nature has made you for a giver, your hands are born open, and so is your heart; and though there may be times when your hands are empty, your heart is always full, and you can give things out of that--warm things, kind things, sweet things--help and comfort and laughter--and sometimes gay, kind laughter is the best help of all."
2600,"There's nothing so strong as rage, except what makes you hold it in—that's stronger. It's a good thing not to answer your enemies. I scarcely ever do."
2601,And the secret garden bloomed and bloomed and every morning revealed new miracles.
2602,"""It's so beautiful!"" she said, a little breathless with her speed. ""You never saw anything so beautiful! It has come! I thought it had come that other morning, but it was only coming. It is here now! It has come, the Spring!"""
2603,"Two things cannot be in one place. Where you tend a rose, my lad, a thistle cannot grow."
2604,Never did she find anything so difficult as to keep herself from losing her temper when she was suddenly disturbed while absorbed in a book.
2605,"When I was at school my jography told me th' earth was shaped like a orange an' I found out before I was ten that th' whole orange doesn't belong to nobody. No one owns more than his bit of a quarter an' there's times it seems there's not enow quarters to go around. But don't you-none o' you- think as you own th' whole orange or you'll find out you're mistaken, an' you won't find it without hard knocks. What children learns from children, is that there's no sense grabbin' at th' whole orange-peel an' all. If you do you'll likely not get even th' pips, an' them's too bitter to eat."
2606,"If you fill your mind with a beautiful thought, there will be no room in it for an ugly one. - King Amor"
2607,"Much more surprising things can happen to anyone who, when a disagreeable or discouraged thought comes into his mind, just has the sense to remember in time and push it out by putting in an agreeable, determinedly courageous one. Two things cannot be in one place."
2608,"I am sure there is Magic in everything, only we have not sense enough to get hold of it and make it do things for us"
2609,"I am a princess. All girls are. Even if they live in tiny old attics. Even if they dress in rags, even if they aren’t pretty, or smart, or young. They’re still princesses."
2610,"Of course there must be lots of Magic in the world,"" he said wisely one day, ""but people don't know what it is like or how to make it. Perhaps the beginning is just to say nice things are going to happen until you make them happen. I am going to try and experiment."
2611,... justice is mercy's highest self.
2612,"In the garden there was nothing which was not quite like themselves - nothing which did not understand the wonderfulness of what was happening to them - the immense, tender, terrible, heart-breaking beauty and solemnity of Eggs. If there had been one person in that garden who had not known through all his or her innermost being that if an Egg were taken away or hurt the whole world would whirl round and crash through space and come to an end... there could have been no happiness even in that golden springtime air."
2613,
2614,"Of all virtues and dignities of the mind, goodness is the greatest"
2615,
2616,It's not what we profess but what we practice that gives us integrity.
2617,Truth can never be reached by just listening to the voice of an authority.
2618,It's not what we eat but what we digest that makes us strong; not what we gain but what we save that makes us rich; not what we read but what we remember that makes us learned; and not what we profess but what we practice that gives us integrity.

2642,
2643,God's definition of what matters is pretty straightforward. He measures our lives by how we love.
2644,But God doesn't call us to be comfortable. He calls us to trust Him so completely that we are unafraid to put ourselves in situations where we will be in trouble if He doesn't come through.
2645,Don't fall into the trap of studying the Bible without doing what it says.
2646,"In our world, where hundreds of things distract us from God, we have to intentionally and consistently remind ourselves of Him."
2647,Trust whatever He has for you. It will be better than anything you can plan for yourself.
2648,We never grow closer to God when we just live life. It takes deliberate pursuit and attentiveness.
2649,"Lukewarm people give money to charity and to the church...so long as it doesn't impinge on their standard of living. Lukewarm people tend to choose what is popular over what is right. Lukewarm people don't really want to be saved from their sin; they want to be saved from the penalty of their sin. Lukewarm people rarely share their faith with their neighbors, coworkers, or friends. Lukewarm people are thankful for their luxuries and comforts, and rarely consider trying to give as much as possible to the poor."

2656,"When the church really takes on the humble characteristics of Christ, that's going to lead to revival."
2657,Following Christ isn't something that can be done halfheartedly or on the side. It is not a label we can display when it is useful. It must be central to everything we do and are.
2658,I have one reason why you should walk away from that temptation right now. One reason: God. Is. Better.
2659,"‎""Do you know that nothing you do in this life will ever matter, unless it is about loving God and loving the people he has made?"
2660,"A relationship with God simply cannot grow when money, sins, activities, favorite sports teams, addictions, or commitments are piled up on top of it."
2661,"The truth is that the Spirit of the living God is guaranteed to ask you to go somewhere or do something you wouldn't normally want or choose to do. The Spirit will lead you into the way of the cross, as He led Jesus to the cross, and that is definitely not a safe or pretty or comfortable place to be. The Holy Spirit of God will mold you into the person you were made to be."
2662,Having faith often means doing what others see as crazy.

2664,
2665,"Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace. 
Where there is hatred, let me sow love, 
Where there is injury, pardon; 
Where there is doubt, faith; 
Where there is despair, hope; 
Where there is darkness, light; 
And where there is sadness, joy. 
O Divine Master, 
Grant that I may not so much seek 
To be consoled as to console, 
To be understood as to understand, 
To be loved, as to love."
2666,"Lord, help me to live this day, quietly, easily. To lean upon Thy great strength, trustfully, restfully. To wait for the unfolding of Thy will, patiently, serenely. To meet others, peacefully, joyously. To face tomorrow, confidently, courageously."

2717,"Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.'

2721,"Reality is what it is, not what you want it to be."
2722,"I'm vile and perverted. I'm obsessed and deranged. I've existed for years but very little has changed. I'm the tool of the government and industry too. For I'm destined to rule and regulate you. You may think I'm pernicious, but you can't look away. I'll make you think I'm delicious with the stuff that I say. I'm the best you can get... have you guessed me yet? I'm the slime oozing out of your TV set."
2723,
2724,It gets harder the more you know. Because the more you find out the uglier everything seems.

2758,"Men are not prisoners of fate, but only prisoners of their own minds."
2759,"We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace - business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering. They had begun to consider the Government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own affairs. We know now that Government by organized money is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob. Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me - and I welcome their hatred."
2760,"I have seen war. I have seen war on land and sea. I have seen blood running from the wounded. I have seen men coughing out their gassed lungs. I have seen the dead in the mud. I have seen cities destroyed. I have seen 200 limping, exhausted men come out of line—the survivors of a regiment of 1,000 that went forward 48 hours before. I have seen children starving. I have seen the agony of mothers and wives. I hate war."
2761,"We may not be able to prepare the future for our children, but we can at least prepare our children for the future."

2775,"I’m doing badly, I’m doing well; whichever you prefer."
2776,"I never wish to be easily defined. I’d rather float over other people’s minds as something strictly fluid and non-perceivable; more like a transparent, paradoxically iridescent creature rather than an actual person."
2777,"I am a cage, in search of a bird."
2778,

2780,Paths are made by walking
2781,I usually solve problems by letting them devour me.
2782,"I have no memory for things I have learned, nor things I have read, nor things experienced or heard, neither for people nor events; I feel that I have experienced nothing, learned nothing, that I actually know less than the average schoolboy, and that what I do know is superficial, and that every second question is beyond me. I am incapable of thinking deliberately; my thoughts run into a wall. I can grasp the essence of things in isolation, but I am quite incapable of coherent, unbroken thinking. I can't even tell a story properly; in fact, I can scarcely talk."
2783,Nothing is as deceptive as a photograph.
2784,

2790,If you could only sense how important you are to the lives of those you meet; how important you can be to the people you may never even dream of. There is something of yourself that you leave at every meeting with another person.
2791,"We live in a world in which we need to share responsibility. It's easy to say ""It's not my child, not my community, not my world, not my problem."" Then there are those who see the need and respond. I consider those people my heroes."
2792,"You make each day a special day. You know how, by just your being you."
2793,"As human beings, our job in life is to help people realize how rare and valuable each one of us really is, that each of us has something that no one else has-or ever will have-something inside that is unique to all time."
2794,"When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, ""Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping."" To this day, especially in times of ""disaster,"" I remember my mother's words and I am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers – so many caring people in this world."
2795,"Some days, doing ""the best we can"" may still fall short of what we would like to be able to do, but life isn't perfect on any front-and doing what we can with what we have is the most we should expect of ourselves or anyone else."
2796,There is something of yourself that you leave at every meeting with another person.
2797,Imagine what our real neighborhoods would be like if each of us offered . . . just one kind word to another person.
2798,"At the center of the Universe is a loving heart that continues to beat and that wants the best for every person. Anything that we can do to help foster the intellect and spirit and emotional growth of our fellow human beings, that is our job. Those of us who have this particular vision must continue against all odds. Life is for service."
2799,Love begins with listening.
2800,"When we love a person, we accept him or her exactly as is: the lovely with the unlovely, the strong with the fearful, the true mixed in with the façade, and of course, the only way we can do it is by accepting ourselves that way."
2801,It always helps to have people we love beside us when we have to do difficult things in life.
2802,"Transitions are almost always signs of growth, but they can bring feelings of loss. To get somewhere new, we may have to leave somewhere else behind."
2803,"Attitudes are caught, not taught."
2804,"Confronting our feelings and giving them appropriate expression always takes strength, not weakness. It takes strength to acknowledge our anger, and sometimes more strength yet to curb the aggressive urges anger may bring and to channel them into nonviolent outlets. It takes strength to face our sadness and to grieve and to let our grief and our anger flow in tears when they need to. It takes strength to talk about our feelings and to reach out for help and comfort when we need it."
2805,Real strength has to do with helping others.
2806,"I believe that appreciation is a holy thing--that when we look for what's best in a person we happen to be with at the moment, we're doing what God does all the time. So in loving and appreciating our neighbor, we're participating in something sacred."

2812,"You know, you don't have to look like everybody else to be acceptable and to feel acceptable."
2813,
2814,"Whatever you do with your life-whatever you end up achieving or not achieving-the great gift you have in you to give to the world is the gift of who you alone are; your way of seeing things, and saying things, and feeling about things, that is like nobody else’s. If so much as a single one of you were missing, there would be an empty place at the great feast of life that nobody else in all creation could fill."
2815,"The grace of God means something like: Here is your life. You might never have been, but you are because the party wouldn't have been complete without you. Here is the world. Beautiful and terrible things will happen. Don't be afraid. I am with you. Nothing can ever separate us. It's for you I created the universe. I love you. There's only one catch. Like any other gift, the gift of grace can be yours only if you'll reach out and take it. Maybe being able to reach out and take it is a gift too."
2816,Pay attention to the things that bring a tear to your eye or a lump in your throat because they are signs that the holy is drawing near.
2817,"When you remember me, it means you have carried something of who I am with you, that I have left some mark of who I am on who you are. It means that you can summon me back to your mind even though countless years and miles may stand between us. It means that if we meet again, you will know me. It means that even after I die, you can still see my face and hear my voice and speak to me in your heart."
2818,"One life on this earth is all that we get, whether it is enough or not enough, and the obvious conclusion would seem to be that at the very least we are fools if we do not live it as fully and bravely and beautifully as we can."
2819,"Lord, catch me off guard today. Surprise me with some moment of beauty or pain so that at least for the moment, I may be startled into seeing that you are here in all your splendor, always and everywhere, barely hidden, beneath, beyond, within this life I breathe."
2820,"In the entire history of the universe, let alone in your own history, there has never been another day just like today, and there will never be another just like it again. Today is the point to which all your yesterdays have been leading since the hour of your birth. It is the point from which all your tomorrows will proceed until the hour of your death. If you were aware of how precious today is, you could hardly live through it. Unless you are aware of how precious it is, you can hardly be said to be living at all."
2821,We find by losing. We hold fast by letting go. We become something new by ceasing to be something old.
2822,Your vocation in life is where your greatest joy meets the world's greatest need.
2823,"Jesus is apt to come, into the very midst of life at its most real and inescapable moments. Not in a blaze of unearthly light, not in the midst of a sermon, not in the throes of some kind of religious daydream, but...at supper time, or walking along a road...He never approached from on high, but always in the midst, in the midst of people, in the midst of real life and the questions that real life asks."
2824,"Listen to your life. See it for the fathomless mystery it is. In the boredom and pain of it, no less than in the excitement and gladness: touch, taste, smell your way to the holy and hidden heart of it, because in the last analysis all moments are key moments, and life itself is grace."
2825,Grace is something you can never get but can only be given. There's no way to earn it or deserve it or bring it about anymore than you can deserve the taste of raspberries and cream or earn good looks. A good night's sleep is grace and so are good dreams. Most tears are grace. The smell of rain is grace. Somebody loving you is grace.
2826,"The world says, The more you take, the more you have. Christ says, the more you give, the more you are."
2827,Resurrection means that the worst thing is never the last thing.

2829,Don't let your life just go in one eye and out the other.
2830,"If you want to be holy, be kind."
2831,"Of the Seven Deadly Sins, anger is possibly the most fun. To lick your wounds, to smack your lips over grievances long past, to roll over your tongue the prospect of bitter confrontations still to come, to savor to the last toothsome morsel both the pain you are given and the pain you are giving back--in many ways it is a feast fit for a king. The chief drawback is that what you are wolfing down is yourself. The skeleton at the feast is you."
2832,"You can kiss your family and friends good-bye and put miles between you, but at the same time you carry them with you in your heart, your mind, your stomach, because you do not just live in a world but a world lives in you."
2833,"The grace of God means something like: Here is your life. You might never have been, but you are because the party wouldn't have been complete without you."
2834,"Whenever you find tears in your eyes, especially unexpected tears, it is well to pay the closest attention. They are not only telling you something about the secret of who you are but, more often than not, God is speaking to you through them of the mystery of where you have come from and is summoning you to where, if your soul is to be saved, you should go to next."
2835,"Maybe it's all utterly meaningless. Maybe it's all unutterably meaningful. If you want to know which, pay attention to what it means to be truly human in a world that half the time we're in love with and half the time scares the hell out of us. Any fiction that helps us pay attention to that is religious fiction. The unexpected sound of your name on somebody's lips. The good dream. The strange coincidence. The moment that brings tears to your eyes. The person who brings life to your life. Even the smallest events hold the greatest clues."
2836,Your calling is where your own greatest joy intersects with the needs of the world.
2837,"Jesus didn't come to merely speak words that were true, He is the Word that makes us true."
2838,
2839,
2840,
2841,"Liberty is meaningless where the right to utter one's thoughts and opinions has ceased to exist. That, of all rights, is the dread of tyrants. It is the right which they first of all strike down. They know its power. Thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers, founded in injustice and wrong, are sure to tremble, if men are allowed to reason... Equally clear is the right to hear. To suppress free speech is a double wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker."
2842,"If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom, and yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. They want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters. This struggle may be a moral one; or it may be a physical one; or it may be both moral and physical; but it must be a struggle."
2843,"Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe."
2844,"I am a Republican, a black, dyed in the wool Republican, and I never intend to belong to any other party than the party of freedom and progress."
2845,"A man's rights rest in three boxes: the ballot box, the jury box, and the cartridge box."
2846,"Education means emancipation. It means light and liberty. It means the uplifting of the soul of man into the glorious light of truth, the light by which men can only be made free."
2847,"Liberty is meaningless where the right to utter one's thoughts and opinions has ceased to exist. That, of all rights, is the dread of tyrants. It is the right which they first of all strike down."
2848,"A slave is someone who sits down, and waits for someone to free them."
2849,"There is no negro problem. The problem is whether the American people have loyalty enough, honor enough, patriotism enough, to live up to their own constitution"
2850,"I will unite with anyone to do good, but with no one to do harm."
2851,"Once you learn to read, you will be forever free."
2852,"Without a struggle, there can be no progress."
2853,I prayed for twenty years but received no answer until I prayed with my legs.
2854,Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.
2855,Man's greatness consists in his ability to do and the proper application of his powers to things needed to be done.
2856,"I knew that however bad the Republican party was, the Democratic party was much worse. The elements of which the Republican party was composed gave better ground for the ultimate hope of the success of the colored mans cause than those of the Democratic party."
2857,"To make a contented slave it is necessary to make a thoughtless one. It is necessary to darken the moral and mental vision and, as far as possible, to annihilate the power of reason."
2858,Knowledge makes a man unfit to be a slave.
2859,"In a composite Nation like ours, made up of almost every variety of the human family, there should be, as before the Law, no rich, no poor, no high, no low, no black, no white, but one country, one citizenship equal rights and a common destiny for all.
A government that cannot or does not protect the humblest citizen in his right to life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness, should be reformed or overthrown, without delay."
2860,"Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both."
2861,"Educate your sons and daughters, send them to school, and show them that beside the cartridge box, the ballot box, and the jury box, you also have the knowledge box."
2862,Truth is proper and beautiful in all times and in all places.
2863,
2864,
2865,
2866,Passion is the bridge that takes you from pain to change.
2867,"I used to think I was the strangest person in the world but then I thought there are so many people in the world, there must be someone just like me who feels bizarre and flawed in the same ways I do. I would imagine her, and imagine that she must be out there thinking of me too. Well, I hope that if you are out there and read this and know that, yes, it's true I'm here, and I'm just as strange as you."
2868,"I drank to drown my sorrows, but the damned things learned how to swim."
2869,
2870,"Can one invent verbs? I want to tell you one: I sky you, so my wings extend so large to love you without measure."
2871,There is nothing more precious than laughter
2872,I paint flowers so they will not die.
2873,"I wish I could do whatever I liked behind the curtain of “madness”. Then: I’d arrange flowers, all day long, I’d paint; pain, love and tenderness, I would laugh as much as I feel like at the stupidity of others, and they would all say: “Poor thing, she’s crazy!” (Above all I would laugh at my own stupidity.) I would build my world which while I lived, would be in agreement with all the worlds. The day, or the hour, or the minute that I lived would be mine and everyone else’s - my madness would not be an escape from “reality”."
2874,"I am that clumsy human, always loving, loving, loving. And loving. And never leaving."
2875,Take a lover who looks at you like maybe you are a bourbon biscuit.
2876,"Feet, what do I need you for when I have wings to fly?"
2877,I am not sick. I am broken. But I am happy as long as I can paint.
2878,"I wanted to tell you that my whole being opened for you. Since I fell in love with you everything is transformed and is full of beauty... love is like an aroma, like a current, like rain."
2879,"Mankind owns its destiny, and its destiny is the earth. We are destroying it until we have no destiny."
2880,I want a storm to come and flood us into a song that no one wrote.
2881,I think that little by little I'll be able to solve my problems and survive.
2882,"Nothing is worth more than laughter. It is strength to laugh and to abandon oneself, to be light. Tragedy is the most ridiculous thing."
2883,Everyone's opinions about things change over time. Nothing is constant. Everything changes. And to hold onto some dogged idea forever is a little rigid and maybe naive.
2884,"I love you more than my own skin and even though you don’t love me the same way, you love me anyways, don’t you? And if you don’t, I’ll always have the hope that you do, and i’m satisfied with that. Love me a little. I adore you."
2885,"I paint self-portraits because I am so often alone, because I am the person I know best."
2886,"My paintings are well-painted, not nimbly but patiently. My painting contains in it the message of pain. I think that at least a few people are interested in it. It's not revolutionary. Why keep wishing for it to be belligerent? I can't. Painting completed my life. I lost three children and a series of other things that would have fulfilled my horrible life. My painting took the place of all of this. I think work is the best."
2887,What would I do without the absurd and the ephemeral?
2888,
2889,"To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering."
2890,
2891,There will always be rocks in the road ahead of us. They will be stumbling blocks or stepping stones; it all depends on how you use them.
2892,
2893,"I was in darkness, but I took three steps and found myself in paradise. The first step was a good thought, the second, a good word; and the third, a good deed."
2894,
2895,"You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist."
2896,Enjoy life. This is not a dress rehearsal.
2897,"I'm not upset that you lied to me, I'm upset that from now on I can't believe you."
2898,"Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you."

2912,"My solitude doesn’t depend on the presence or absence of people; on the contrary, I hate who steals my solitude without, in exchange, offering me true company."
2913,
2914,"America, it is said, is suffering from intolerance - it is not. It is suffering from tolerance. Tolerance of right and wrong, truth and error, virtue and evil, Christ and chaos. Our country is not nearly so overrun with the bigoted as it is overrun with the broadminded."
2915,"The refusal to take sides on great moral issues is itself a decision. It is a silent acquiescence to evil. The Tragedy of our time is that those who still believe in honesty lack fire and conviction, while those who believe in dishonesty are full of passionate conviction."
2916,"Moral principles do not depend on a majority vote. Wrong is wrong, even if everybody is wrong. Right is right, even if nobody is right."
2917,"Prayer begins by talking to God, but it ends by listening to Him. In the face of Absolute Truth, silence is the soul's language."
2918,Civilization is always in danger when those who have never learned to obey are given the right to command.
2919,God does not love us because we are valuable. We are valuable because God loves us.
2920,"When a man loves a woman, he has to become worthy of her. The higher her virtue, the more noble her character, the more devoted she is to truth, justice, goodness, the more a man has to aspire to be worthy of her. The history of civilization could actually be written in terms of the level of its women."
2921,"Freedom does not mean that right to do whatever we please, but rather to do as we ought. The right to do whatever we please reduces freedom to a physical power and forgets that freedom is a moral power."
2922,"If you do not worship God, you worship something, and nine times out of ten it will be yourself. You have a duty to worship God, not because He will be imperfect and unhappy if you do not, but because you will be imperfect and unhappy."
2923,It's impossible to lose your footing when you're on your knees.
2924,"If you do not live what you believe, you will end up believing what you live."
2925,"The humble, simple souls, who are little enough to see the bigness of God in the littleness of a Babe, are therefore the only ones who will ever understand the reason of His visitation. He came to this poor earth of ours to carry on an exchange; to say to us, as only the Good God could say: 'you give me your humanity, and I will give you my Divinity; you give me your time, and I will give you My eternity; you give me your broken heart, and I will give you Love; you give me your nothingness, and I will give you My all."
2926,"There is no word more ""dangerous"" than liberalism, because to oppose it is the new ""unforgivable sin."""
2927,Many souls fail to find God because they want a religion which will remake society without remaking themselves.
2928,"Live each day as you would climb a mountain. An occasional glance toward the summit keeps the goal in mind, but many beautiful scenes are to be observed from each new vantage point. So climb slowly, enjoying each passing moment; and then the view from the summit will serve a more rewarding climax for your journey."
2929,"Today (1950), the hatred of the Moslem countries against the West is becoming hatred against Christianity itself. Although the statesmen have not yet taken it into account, there is still grave danger that the temporal power of Islam may return and, with it, the menace that it may shake off a West which has ceased to be Christian, and affirm itself as a great anti-Christian world Power."
2930,The greatest love story of all time is contained in a tiny white Host.
2931,Sometimes the only way the good Lord can get into some hearts is to break them.
2932,When you are getting kicked from the rear it means you are in front.
2933,"Joy is not the same as pleasure or happiness. A wicked and evil man may have pleasure, while any ordinary mortal is capable of being happy. Pleasure generally comes from things, and always through the senses; happiness comes from humans through fellowship. Joy comes from loving God and neighbor. Pleasure is quick and violent, like a flash of lightning. Joy is steady and abiding, like a fixed star. Pleasure depends on external circumstances, such as money, food, travel, etc. Joy is independent of them, for it comes from a good conscience and love of God."
2934,"Love is the key to the mystery. Love by its very nature is not selfish, but generous. It seeks not its own, but the good of others. The measure of love is not the pleasure it gives-that is the way the world judges it-but the joy and peace it can purchase for others."
2935,"If I were not a Catholic, and were looking for the true Church in the world today, I would look for the one Church which did not get along well with the world; in other words, I would look for the Church which the world hated."
2936,"Our happiest times are those in which we forget ourselves, usually in being kind to someone else. That tiny moment of self-abdication is an act of true humility: the man who loses himself finds himself and finds his happiness."
2937,"Very few people believe in the devil these days, which suits the devil very well. He is always helping to circulate the news of his own death. The essence of God is existence, and He defines Himself as: 'I am Who am.' The essence of the devil is the lie, and he defines himself as: 'I am who am not.' Satan has very little trouble with those who do not believe in him; they are already on his side."
2938,
2939,The best way to keep a prisoner from escaping is to make sure he never knows he's in prison.
2940,"A man who lies to himself, and believes his own lies becomes unable to recognize truth, either in himself or in anyone else, and he ends up losing respect for himself and for others. When he has no respect for anyone, he can no longer love, and, in order to divert himself, having no love in him, he yields to his impulses, indulges in the lowest forms of pleasure, and behaves in the end like an animal. And it all comes from lying - lying to others and to yourself."
2941,
2942,"The darker the night, the brighter the stars, The deeper the grief, the closer is God!"
2943,
2944,
2945,"When I look back on my past and think how much time I wasted on nothing, how much time has been lost in futilities, errors, laziness, incapacity to live; how little I appreciated it, how many times I sinned against my heart and soul-then my heart bleeds. Life is a gift, life is happiness, every minute can be an eternity of happiness."
2946,"If you want to overcome the whole world, overcome yourself."
2947,"Love the animals, love the plants, love everything. If you love everything, you will perceive the divine mystery in things. Once you perceive it, you will begin to comprehend it better every day. And you will come at last to love the whole world with an all-embracing love."
2948,"I gave up caring about anything, and all the problems disappeared."
2949,To be in love is not the same as loving. You can be in love with a woman and still hate her.
2950,A single day is sufficient for a man to discover what happiness is.
2951,Suffering is the sole origin of consciousness.
2952,A hundred suspicions don't make a proof.
2953,The prince says that the world will be saved by beauty! And I maintain that the reason he has such playful ideas is that he is in love.
2954,
2955,"She looked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost always the case with women who retain serenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pure sincere warmth of heart to old age."
2956,"The more you succeed in loving, the more you'll be convinced at the existence of God and the immortality of your soul."
2957,"A man who lies to himself, and believes his own lies, becomes unable to recognize truth, either in himself or in anyone else, and he ends up losing respect for himself and for others."
2958,"If there is no God, then I am God."
2959,Only through suffering can we find ourselves.
2960,... what you need more than anything in life is a definite position.
2961,"But man is so addicted to systems and to abstract conclusions that he is prepared deliberately to distort the truth, to close his eyes and ears, but justify his logic at all cost."
2962,But how could you live and have no story to tell?
2963,
2964,It doesn't have anything to do with how the world perceives you. What matters is what you see.
2965,"Personally, it’s rude. You got three kids with the lady, she just did 17 years for you and you’re not gonna leave your...whatever!"
2966,"People always ask me, 'You have so much confidence. Where did that come from?'. It came from me. One day I decided that I was beautiful, and so I carried out my life as if I was a beautiful girl. I wear colors that I really like, I wear makeup that makes me feel pretty, and it really helps. It doesn't have anything to do with how the world perceives you. What matters is what you see."
2967,"If they hadn’t tried to break me down, I wouldn’t know that I’m unbreakable."
2968,"I am the only consistent person in my life and so I better like myself, and I better love myself. And I really better know that I'm as beautiful as anyone else."
2969,I don't fixate on other people's opinions of my body.
2970,My beauty is dark chocolate and it's delicious and it's sweet.
2971,"One day I decided that I was beautiful, and so I carried out my life as if I was a beautiful girl."
2972,One day I had to sit down with myself and decide that I loved myself no matter what my body looked like and what other people thought about my body. I got tired of hating myself.
2973,I don't think my brand of self-confidence and self-assuredness can come from an outside source. It's got to come from me.
2974,"Your body is your temple, it's your home, and you must decorate it."
2975,"I can't quite say that I was raised Muslim, but I remember up until 5 or so I would pray, you know, with my dad. And it's actually a beautiful practice. It's giving of yourself to a higher power - no matter what you call that higher power. Living your life as close to what you think that higher power wants you to be is a really powerful thing."
2976,I don't know any teenager with a positive attitude.
2977,"I hate yoga so much. Like, if yoga was a person, I'd stab them."
2978,I live my life because I dare. I dare to show up when everyone else might hide their faces and hide their bodies in shame.
2979,"Just relax. When I was younger, I made myself the victim of catastrophic thinking. Anything that went wrong was the end of the world. But as I've gotten older, I've learned to stop myself and say, 'Hey babe, calm down. Tomorrow there will be sun.'"
2980,"Most of my life, I wanted to be a therapist, but then I just decided that I didn't want to be in charge of giving people advice. I want to know everything there is to know about psychology. But a therapist? No."
2981,"I certainly used to wish that I was skinny, lighter-skinned, with long, pretty hair. But only because I used to get made fun of for being the absolute opposite. I didn't see all of that stuff as the American Dream. I just wanted to look normal. Now that I'm older, I really do feel like I am a beautiful girl."
2982,"I learned to love myself, because I sleep with myself every night and I wake up with myself every morning, and if I don't like myself, there's no reason to even live the life."
2983,"I think people look at me and don't expect much. Even though, I expect a whole lot."
2984,I was born to stand out. I don't care whether or not people will find me attractive on screen. That's not why I became an actor. I know that more and more with each new role.
2985,"My Plan A was to be a psychologist. I thought I would be a receptionist. I'm always middle of the road and very normal. I've always wanted a normal life, and this is what I got."
2986,"They try to paint the picture that I was this downtrodden, ugly girl who was unpopular in school and in life, and then I got this role and now I’m awesome. But the truth is that I’ve been awesome, and then I got this role."
2987,"I love the way I look. I'm fine with it. And if my body changes, I'll be fine with that."
2988,
2989,"Even when the winds of misfortune blow, amazing things can still happen."
2990,What matters in life is not what happens to you but what you remember and how you remember it.
2991,"Never stop smiling not even when you're sad, someone might fall in love with your smile."
2992,"If I knew that today would be the last time I’d see you, I would hug you tight and pray the Lord be the keeper of your soul. If I knew that this would be the last time you pass through this door, I’d embrace you, kiss you, and call you back for one more. If I knew that this would be the last time I would hear your voice, I’d take hold of each word to be able to hear it over and over again. If I knew this is the last time I see you, I’d tell you I love you, and would not just assume foolishly you know it already."
2993,Life is but a continual succession of opportunities for surviving.

2998,"I have learned that a man has the right and obligation to look down at another man, only when that man needs help to get up from the ground."
2999,The people of the United States are one of the people I most admire in the world. The only thing I don't understand is why a country that manages to do so well cannot do better in choosing its president.
3000,It's enough for me to be sure that you and I exist at this moment.
3001,"If you love something - let. If it is yours - it will come back. I love you not because of who you are, but for who I am when I'm with you."

3012,"Life is not what one lived, but what One remembers and how One remembers it in order to recount it"
3013,
3014,"Changing the world begins with the very personal process of changing yourself, the only place you can begin is where you are, and the only time you can begin is always now."
3015,"When you ask the Universe to bless you in your effort to align yourself with your soul, you open a passageway between yourself and your guides and Teachers. That is what a blessing is: the opening of a passageway between you and nonphysical guidance."
3016,What is behind your eyes holds more power than what is in front of them.
3017,For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. You receive from the world what you give to the world.
3018,Forgiveness means that you do not carry the baggage of an experience.
3019,"Humbleness, forgiveness, clarity and love are the dynamics of freedom. They are the foundations of authentic power."
3020,"The journey to wholeness requires that you look honestly, openly, and with courage into yourself, into the dynamics that lie behind what you feel, what you perceive, what you value, and how you act. It is a journey through your defenses and beyond, so that you can experience consciously the nature of your personality, face what it has produced in your life, and choose to change that. Words lead to deeds. They prepare the soul, make it ready, and move it to tenderness."
3021,You gain or lose power according to the choices that you make.
3022,"There comes a time when the pain of continuing exceeds the pain of stopping. At that moment, a threshold is crossed. What seemed unthinkable becomes thinkable. Slowly, the realization emerges that the choice to continue what you have been doing is the choice to live in discomfort, and the choice to stop what you have been doing is the choice to breathe deeply and freely again. Once that realization has emerged, you can either honor it or ignore it, but you cannot forget it. What has become known can not become unknown again."
3023,The first step toward spiritual growth is to become aware of your emotions.
3024,"Every intention sets energy into motion
Whether you are conscious of it or not."
3025,"Knowledge is power, and for each level of knowledge, you are held responsible for how you use it."
3026,"When you choose not to forgive, the experience that you do not forgive sticks with you."
3027,"When you welcome your emotions as teachers, 
every emotion brings good news, 
even the ones that are painful."
3028,"Do not lose power over the what-ifs of your life. These are unlimited and endless. Keep your power in the now, in present time."
3029,"Eventually, you will come to understand that love heals everything, and love is all there is."
3030,"If we perceived life with reverence, we would stand in awe at the experience of physical life and walk the earth in a very deep sense of gratitude."
3031,A power struggle collapses when you withdraw your energy from it. Power struggles become uninteresting to you when you change your intention from winning to learning about yourself.
3032,"The pains that you suffer, the loneliness that you encounter, the experiences that are disappointing or distressing, the addictions and seeming pitfalls of your life are each doorways to awareness. Each offers you an opportunity to see beyond the illusion that serves as the balancing and growth of your soul."
3033,"Please... tell me who you are and what you want. And if you think those are simple questions, keep in mind that most people live their entire lives without arriving at an answer."
3034,Most people use their energy attempting to rearrange circumstances that trigger painful emotions. Changing external circumstances will not change your rigid patterns of emotional response. That requires looking at the patterns themselves.
3035,You must distinguish between what is urgent and what is important. You could accomplish all of the urgent things that you desire without accomplishing anything that is important.
3036,"Your emotional reactions to the evil you encounter and your judgments of it show you what you need to change in yourself. Changing those parts of your personality that judge, react in fear, and cannot love into acceptance, fearlessness, and love is the journey you were born to make."
3037,"You cannot, and will not, encounter
a circumstance, or a single moment,
that does not serve directly and immediately 
the need of your soul to heal."
3038,
3039,Happiness is different from pleasure. Happiness has something to do with struggling and enduring and accomplishing.
3040,"There are as many reasons for running as there are days in the year, years in my life. But mostly I run because I am an animal and a child, an artist and a saint. So, too, are you. Find your own play, your own self-renewing compulsion, and you will become the person you are meant to be."
3041,The real competition is against the little voice inside you that wants to quit
3042,The answer to the big questions in running is the same as the answer to the big questions in life: Do the best with what you've got.
3043,"Success means having the courage, the determination, and the will to become the person you believe you were meant to be."
3044,"Everyone is an athlete. The only difference is that some of us are in training, and some are not."
3045,"The more I run, the more I want to run, and the more I live a life conditioned and influenced and fashioned by my running. And the more I run, the more certain I am that I am heading for my real goal: to become the person I am."
3046,"Running is just such a monastery- a retreat, a place to commune with God and yourself, a place for psychological and spiritual renewal."
3047,Sweat cleanses from the inside. It comes from places a shower will never reach.
3048,"There are those of us who are always about to live. We are waiting until things change, until there is more time, until we are less tired, until we get a promotion, until we settle down / until, until, until.

3272,No individual has any right to come into the world and go out of it without leaving behind him distinct and legitimate reasons for having passed through it.
3273,God is going to reveal to us things He never revealed before if we put our hands in His. No books ever go into my laboratory. The thing I am to do and the way of doing it are revealed to me. I never have to grope for methods. The method is revealed to me the moment I am inspired to create something new. Without God to draw aside the curtain I would be helpless.
3274,"It is not the style of clothes one wears, neither the kind of automobile one drives, nor the amount of money one has in the bank, that counts.  These mean nothing.  It is simply service that measures success."
3275,"Where there is no vision, there is no hope."
3276,The secret of my success? It is simple. It is found in the Bible.
3277,"My prayers seem to be more of an attitude than anything else. I indulge in very little lip service, but ask the Great Creator silently, daily, and often many times a day, to permit me to speak to Him through the three great Kingdoms of the world which He has created - the animal, mineral, and vegetable Kingdoms - to understand their relations to each other, and our relations to them and to the Great God who made all of us. I ask Him daily and often momently to give me wisdom, understanding, and bodily strength to do His will; hence I am asking and receiving all the time."
3278,"Education, in the broadest of truest sense, will make an individual seek to help all people, regardless of race, regardless of color, regardless of condition."

3295,The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of Conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected.
3296,"Truth can understand error, but error cannot understand truth."
3297,Without education we are in a horrible and deadly danger of taking educated people seriously.

3299,"God is like the sun; you cannot look at it, but without it you cannot look at anything else."
3300,It is absurd for the Evolutionist to complain that it is unthinkable for an admittedly unthinkable God to make everything out of nothing and then pretend that it is more thinkable that nothing should turn itself into everything.
3301,"But the truth is that it is only by believing in God that we can ever criticise the Government. Once abolish the God, and the Government becomes the God."
3302,"If men will not be governed by the Ten Commandments, they shall be governed by the ten thousand commandments"

3305,"The true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him, but because he loves what is behind him."

3311,It is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged.
3312,"The coming peril is the intellectual, educational, psychological and artistic overproduction, which, equally with economic overproduction, threatens the well-being of contemporary civilisation. People are inundated, blinded, deafened, and mentally paralysed by a flood of vulgar and tasteless externals, leaving them no time for leisure, thought, or creation from within themselves."
3313,
3314,Marriage works best for men than women. The two happiest groups are married men and unmarried women.
3315,"Sex and race, because they are easy and visible differences, have been the primary ways of organizing human beings into superior and inferior groups and into the cheap labour on which this system still depends."
3316,
3317,We need to stop raising boys to think that they need to prove their masculinity by being controlling or by not showing emotion or by not being little girls.
3318,"Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning."
3319,"Far too many people are looking for the right person, instead of trying to be the right person."
3320,"Men, through no fault of theirs, get born into cultures that tell them that if a woman can do it, it's not worth doing, or if they're not superior to women in one way or another, they're not really masculine."
3321,What would happen if we listened to children as much as we talked to them?
3322,A woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle.
3323,
3324,"At my age, in this still hierarchical time, people often ask me if I’m “passing the torch.” I explain that I’m keeping my torch, thank you very much-and I’m using it to light the torches of others."

3331,"In order to make a choice, you need the power to see there is one."
3332,"When I'm talking to people, I find myself quoting the three organizing rules of Black Lives Matter. Black Lives Matter was initiated by three young women, and too few people know that. But, anyway, the first one is lead with love. The second is low ego, high impact. The third is move with the speed of trust. I must say those make me feel very hopeful for the future."

I said, 'But it's the men who are attacking the women. If there's to be a curfew, let the men stay home, not the women."
3351,"By the way, did you ever realize that if Moses would have turned right instead of left, we'd have had the oil, the Arabs would have had the sand?"

3353,"It isn't really important to decide when you are very young just exactly what you want to become when you grow up. It is much more important to decide on the way you want to live. If you are going to be honest with yourself and honest with your friends, if you are going to get involved in causes which are good for others, not only for yourselves, then it seems to me that that is sufficient, and maybe what you will be is only a matter of chance."
3354,Those that perished in Hitler's gas chambers were the last Jews to die without standing up to defend themselves.

3357,We Jews have a secret weapon in our struggle with the Arabs; we have no place to go.
3358,How can we return the occupied territories? There is nobody to return them to.
3359,This country exists as the fulfillment of a promise made by God Himself. It would be ridiculous to ask it to account for its legitimacy.
3360,"My dear, old age is like an airplane flying in a storm. Once you're in it there's nothing you can do. You can't stop a plane, you can't stop a storm, you can't stop time. So you might as well take it easy, with wisdom."

3362,Israel itself is the strongest guarantee against another Holocaust.

3375,"If Colleen Howe had been a hockey player, she would have been a centremen. I can see her as a centreman because you can do what you want and go wherever you want to go."
3376,Overall I can fairly safely say Bobby Orr impressed me more than anybody with his tremendous talents. In Bobby's first N.H.L. game he layed the lumber to Gordie's head. Later Howe retalliated and wanted to let the kid know he wasn't washed up yet.
3377,The kid looks good in his first game.
3378,"I helped put in a rink in Cadillac, Michigan, when my wife was very healthy. She helped them put it in and the rink is going full-bore the last time I was there."
3379,My mother and dad played the fiddle and the guitar.
3380,"Don’t be gloomy. Do not dwell on unkind things. Stop seeking out the storms and enjoy more fully the sunlight.

If we will put our trust in Him, if we will pray to Him, if we will live worthy of His blessings, He will hear our prayers."
3384,"What I am suggesting is that each of us turn from the negativism that permeates our society and look for the remarkable good among those with whom we associate, that we speak of one another’s virtues more than we speak of one another’s faults, that optimism replace pessimism, that our faith exceed our fears. When I was a young man and was prone to speak critically, my father would say: “Cynics do not contribute, skeptics do not create, doubters do not achieve."
3385,"All of us have problems. We face them every day. How grateful I am that we have difficult things to wrestle with. They keep us young, they keep us alive, they keep us going, they keep us humble. Be grateful for your problems, and know that somehow there will come a solution. Just do the best you can, but be sure it is the very best."

3392,You have not failed until you quit trying.
3393,"In all of living, have much fun and laughter. Life is to be enjoyed, not just endured."
3394,The best antidote I know for worry is work. The best cure for weariness is the challenge of helping someone who is even more tired. One of the great ironies of life is this: He or she who serves almost always benefits more than he or she who is served.
3395,I am satisfied that happiness in marriage is not so much a matter of romance as it is an anxious concern for the comfort and well-being of one's companion. Any man who will make his wife's comfort his first concern will stay in love with her throughout their lives and through the eternity yet to come

But the Lord has told us to lift our hearts and rejoice. I see so many people...who seem never to see the sunshine, but who constantly walk with storms under cloudy skies. Cultivate an attitude of happiness. Cultivate a spirit of optimism. Walk with faith, rejoicing in the beauties of nature, in the goodness of those you love, in the testimony which you carry in your heart concerning things divine."
3400,Mediocrity will never do. You are capable of something better.

3402,"The major work of the world is not done by geniuses. It is done by ordinary people, with balance in their lives, who have learned to work in an extraordinary manner."
3403,"There is no obstacle too great, no challenge too difficult, if we have faith."
3404,We are creatures of our thinking. We can talk ourselves into defeat or we can talk ourselves into victory.

3423,Middle age is when you go to bed at night and hope you feel better in the morning. Old age is when you go to bed at night and hope you wake up in the morning.
3424,"Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read."
3425,"This isn't a particularly novel observation, but the world is full of people who think they can manipulate the lives of others merely by getting a law passed."

3444,"In spite of how things may appear to us, we are never trapped by where we are. The trap is always who we are"
3445,Discouragement is a negative emotion with more than one trick up its dark sleeve.  It tricks you into mentally or emotionally dwelling in the very place you want to leave.  Drop all such sorrow permanently by daring to see through this deception of the unconscious mind.  You have a destination far beyond where you find yourself standing today
3446,Trying to change ourselves in order to please others - so that we can feel temporarily whole for having won their approval - is like cutting a flower into pieces so that it will fit into a vase.

3456,What really matters is what you do with what you have.

3475,"The world state must begin; it can only begin, as a propaganda cult, or as a group of propagandist cults, to which men and women must give themselves and their energies, regardless of the consequence to themselves The activities of a cult which sets itself to bring about the world-state would at first be propagandist, they would be intellectual and educational, and only as a sufficient mass of opinion and will had accumulated would they become to a predominant extent politically constructive.

3497,Remember that how you say something is as important as what you say.
3498,"Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are, to some extent, a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it, piece by piece - by thought, choice, courage, and determination."
3499,Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do.
3500,Remember that almost everything looks better after a good night's sleep.
3501,May our adversities make us strong. May our victories make us wise. May our actions make us proud.
3502,"Instruction for life: Take into account that great love and great achievements involve great risk. When you lose, don't lose the lesson. Follow the three R's: - Respect for self. - Respect for others. - Responsibility for all your actions. Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck. Learn the rules so you know how to break them properly."

3507,The urge to save humanity is almost always a false front for the urge to rule.
3508,It is the classic fallacy of our time that a moron run through a university and decorated with a Ph.D. will thereby cease to be a moron.
3509,"The government consists of a gang of men exactly like you and me. They have, taking one with another, no special talent for the business of government; they have only a talent for getting and holding office. Their principal device to that end is to search out groups who pant and pine for something they can't get and to promise to give it to them. Nine times out of ten that promise is worth nothing. The tenth time is made good by looting A to satisfy B. In other words, government is a broker in pillage, and every election is sort of an advance auction sale of stolen goods."
3510,The men the American people admire most extravagantly are the most daring liars; the men they detest most violently are those who try to tell them the truth.
3511,"People do not expect to find chastity in a whorehouse. Why, then, do they expect to find honesty and humanity in government, a congeries of institutions whose modus operandi consists of lying, cheating, stealing, and if need be, murdering those who resist?"
3512,"The most dangerous man to any government is the man who is able to think things out... without regard to the prevailing superstitions and taboos. Almost inevitably he comes to the conclusion that the government he lives under is dishonest, insane, intolerable."
3513,The demagogue is one who preaches doctrines he knows to be untrue to men he knows to be idiots.
3514,"Every normal man must be tempted, at times, to spit on his hands, hoist the black flag, and begin slitting throats."

3516,"The State doesn't just want you to obey, it wants to make you WANT to obey."
3517,"The plain fact is that education is itself a form of propaganda - a deliberate scheme to outfit the pupil, not with the capacity to weigh ideas, but with a simple appetite for gulping ideas ready-made. The aim is to make 'good' citizens, which is to say, docile and uninquisitive citizens."
3518,"Morality is doing what is right, no matter what you are told. Religion is doing what you are told, no matter what is right."
3519,"After all is said and done, a hell lot of a lot more is said than done."
3520,"For every problem, there is a solution that is simple, neat, and wrong."
3521,Democracy is a pathetic belief in the collective wisdom of individual ignorance.
3522,"In this world of sin and sorrow there is always something to be thankful for; as for me, I rejoice that I am not a Republican."
3523,"When somebody says it’s not about the money, it’s about the money."
3524,"If a politician found he had cannibals among his constituents, he would promise them missionaries for dinner."
3525,A professional politician is a professionally dishonorable man. In order to get anywhere near high office he has to make so many compromises and submit to so many humiliations that he becomes indistinguishable from a streetwalker.
3526,"No one in this world, so far as I know - and I have searched the records for years, and employed agents to help me - has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain people."
3527,"[T]he only thing wrong with Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address was that it was the South, not the North, that was fighting for a government of the people, by the people and for the people."
3528,Freedom of press is limited to those who own one.
3529,"A fool who, after plain warning, persists in dosing himself with dangerous drugs should be free to do so, for his death is a benefit to the race in general."
3530,
3531,Say it before you run out of time. Say it before it's too late. Say what you're feeling. Waiting is a mistake.
3532,Spend your money on the things money can buy. Spend your time on the things money can’t buy.
3533,Some things in life are too complicated to explain in any language.
3534,"Sometimes it's not the people who change, it's the mask that falls off."
3535,
3536,"But if you knew you might not be able to see it again tomorrow, everything would suddenly become special and precious, wouldn’t it?"
3537,Never let the darkness or negativity outside affect your inner self. Just wait until morning comes and the bright light will drown out the darkness.
3538,Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.

3547,"As time goes on, you'll understand. What lasts, lasts; what doesn't, doesn't. Time solves most things. And what time can't solve, you have to solve yourself."
3548,The thing I’m most afraid of is me. Of not knowing what I’m going to do. Of not knowing what I’m doing right now
3549,"If you think of someone enough, you’re sure to meet them again."
3550,"If you can’t understand it without an explanation, you can’t understand it with an explanation."
3551,"I have this strange feeling that I'm not myself anymore. It's hard to put into words, but I guess it's like I was fast asleep, and someone came, disassembled me, and hurriedly put me back together again. That sort of feeling."
3552,Everything passes. Nobody gets anything for keeps. And that's how we've got to live.
3553,"Whenever I look at the ocean, I always want to talk to people, but when I'm talking to people, I always want to look at the ocean."
3554,"Sometimes when I look at you, I feel I'm gazing at a distant star. It's dazzling, but the light is from tens of thousands of years ago. Maybe the star doesn't even exist any more. Yet sometimes that light seems more real to me than anything."
3555,
3556,"Life is too short to wake up with regrets. So love the people who treat you right. Forget about those who don’t. Believe everything happens for a reason. If you get a chance, take it. If it changes your life, let it. Nobody said life would be easy, they just promised it would most likely be worth it."
3557,"Mackay's Moral: If you are persistent, you will get it. If you are consistent, you will keep it."
3558,"Good habits are as addictive as bad habits, and a lot more rewarding."
3559,"Positive thinking is more than just a tagline. It changes the way we behave. And I firmly believe that when I am positive, it not only makes me better, but it also makes those around me better."
3560,A mediocre person tells. A good person explains. A superior person demonstrates. A great person inspires others to see for themselves.
3561,"None of us got to where we are alone. Whether the assistance we received was obvious or subtle, acknowledging someone's help is a big part of understanding the importance of saying thank you."
3562,Life is series of opportunities. The often neglected fact of life is that opportunities multiply as you take advantage of them.
3563,A dream is just a dream. A goal is a dream with a plan and a deadline.
3564,Your day usually goes the way the corners of your mouth turn. The most powerful single thing you can do to influence others is to smile at them.
3565,Anyone too busy to say thank you will get fewer and fewer chances to say it.
3566,"When you wake up every day, you have two choices. You can either be positive or negative; an optimist or a pessimist. I choose to be an optimist. It's all a matter of perspective."

3570,Don't water your weeds.
3571,Optimists are right. So are pessimists. It's up to you to choose which you will be.
3572,"Winners surround themselves with other winners.  A winner knows he's a winner.  He doesn't need second-raters and yes-men around to feed his ego.  He knows he'll win more, and go further, with associates who not only can keep up with him but who also are capable of teaching him something."
3573,Hard work often leads to success. No work seldom does.
3574,Goals give you more than a reason to get up in the morning; they are an incentive to keep you going all day.
3575,It doesn't matter how much milk you spill as long as you don't lose the cow.

3587,The place between your comfort zone and your dream is where life takes place.
3588,"The struggle of life is one of our greatest blessings. It makes us patient, sensitive, and Godlike. It teaches us that although the world is full of suffering, it is also full of the overcoming of it."
3589,"I am only one,
But still I am one. 
I cannot do everything, 
But still I can do something; 
And because I cannot do everything, 
I will not refuse to do the something that I can do."
3590,"Hope sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves the impossible."
3591,The best educated human being is the one who understands most about the life in which he is placed.
3592,A bend in the road is not the end of the road…Unless you fail to make the turn.

3599,"Even if you have a problem, you don't need to be one."
3600,What we have once enjoyed we can never lose. All that we love deeply becomes a part of us.
3601,"I long to accomplish a great and noble task, but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble."
3602,"God doesn't promise security from life's storms but security in life's storms. God doesn't always call the equipped, but he will always equip the called. In the long run, avoiding danger is no safer than outright exposure. The fearful are caught as often as the bold."
3603,
3604,"I believe there are angels among us, sent down to us from somewhere up above. They come to you and me in our darkest hours, to show us how to live, to teach us how to give, to guide us with a light of love."
3605,"Time is not measured by the years that you live But by the deeds that you do and the joy that you give- And each day as it comes brings a chance to each one To love to the fullest, leaving nothing undone That would brighten the life or lighten the load Of some weary traveler lost on Life's Road- So what does it matter how long we may live If as long as we live we unselfishly give."
3606,"May tender memories soften your grief, May fond recollection bring you relief, And may you find comfort and peace in the thought Of the joy that knowing your loved one brought... For time and space can never divide Or keep your loved one from your side. When memory paints in colors true, the happy hours that belonged to you."
3607,"God, teach me to be patient, teach me to go slow, Teach me how to wait on You when my way I do not know. Teach me sweet forbearance when things do not go right So I remain unruffled when others grow uptight. Teach me how to quiet my racing, rising heart So I might hear the answer You are trying to impart. Teach me to let go, dear God, and pray undisturbed until My heart is filled with inner peace and I learn to know your will."
3608,"After the clouds, the sunshine; after the winter, the spring; after the shower, the rainbow; for life is a changeable thing. After the night, the morning, bidding all darkness cease, after life's cares and sorrows, the comfort and sweetness of peace."
3609,"A Mother's love is something   that no one can explain,   It is made of deep devotion   and of sacrifice and pain,   It is endless and unselfish   and enduring come what may   For nothing can destroy it   or take that love away"
3610,Grief is a solitary journey. No one but you knows how great the hurt is. No one but you can know the gaping hole left in your life when someone you know has died. And no one but you can mourn the silence that was once filled with laughter and song. It is the nature of love and of death to touch every person in a totally unique way. Comfort comes from knowing that people have made the same journey. And solace comes from understanding how others have learned to sing again.
3611,"Love is like magic and it always will be. For love still remains life's sweet mystery! Love works in ways that are wondrous and strange and there's nothing in life that love cannot change! Love can transform the most commonplace into beauty and splendor and sweetness and grace. Love is unselfish, understanding and kind, for it sees with its heart and not with its mind! Love is the answer that everyone seeks... Love is the language, that every heart speaks. Love can't be bought, it is priceless and free, love, like pure magic, is life's sweet mystery!"
3612,"In this troubled world, it's refreshing to find someone who still has the time to be kind. Someone who still has the faith to believe that the more you give, the more you receive. Someone who's ready by thought, word, or deed to reach out a hand, in the hour of need."
3613,"You cannot change reality, but you can control the manner in which you look at things. Your attitude is under your own control. Weed out the negative and focus on the positive!"
3614,"God grant me courage and hope for everyday, faith to guide me along my way, understanding and wisdom, too, and grace to accept what life gives me to do."
3615,No matter how steep the mountain - the Lord is going to climb it with you.
3616,"When you ask God for a gift, Be thankful if he sends, Not diamonds, pearls or riches, but the love of real true friends."
3617,"When you are in troubled and worried and sick at heart And your plans are upset and your world falls apart, Remember God's ready and waiting to share The burden you find much to heavy to bear-- So with faith, ""Let Go and Let GOD"" lead your way Into a brighter and less troubled day"
3618,"The way to real growth is not to become more powerful or more famous, but to become more human and more tolerant."
3619,"A mother's love is like a beacon, Burning bright with Faith and Prayer, And through the changing scenes of life, We can find a haven there."
3620,"In everything both great and small, We see the Hand of God in all."
3621,Never borrow sorrow from tomorrow.
3622,"A mother's love is something that no one can explain — It is made of deep devotion and of sacrifice and pain. It is endless and unselfish and enduring, come what may, For nothing can destroy it or take that love away. It is patient and forgiving when all others are forsaking, And it never fails or falters even though the heart is breaking."
3623,Comfort comes from knowing that people have made the same journey. And solace comes from understanding how others have learned to sing again.
3624,"ADVERSITY CAN DISTRESS US OR BLESS US The way we use adversity is strictly our own choice, For in God's Hands adversity can make the heart rejoice - For everything God sends to us, no matter in what form, Is sent with plan and purpose for by the fierceness of a storm The atmosphere is changed and cleared and the earth is washed and clean."
3625,"Stop wishing for things you complain you have not, and start making the best of all that you've got."
3626,"A wee bit of heaven drifted down from above, a handful of happiness, a heart full of love."
3627,"For each time you smile you will find it's true somebody, somewhere, will smile back at you."
3628,Love changes darkness into light and makes the heart take a wingless flight.
3629,"It takes a Mother’s Love to make a house a home, a place to be remembered, no matter where we roam."
3630,
3631,"Nobody escapes being wounded. We are all wounded people, whether physically, emotionally, mentally, or spiritually. The main question is not, 'How can we hide our wounds?' so we don't have to be embarrassed, but 'How can we put our woundedness in the service of others?' When our wounds cease to be a source of shame, and become a source of healing, we have become wounded healers."
3632,"Compassion asks us to go where it hurts, to enter into the places of pain, to share in brokenness, fear, confusion, and anguish. Compassion challenges us to cry out with those in misery, to mourn with those who are lonely, to weep with those in tears. Compassion requires us to be weak with the weak, vulnerable with the vulnerable, and powerless with the powerless. Compassion means full immersion in the condition of being human."
3633,"Did I offer peace today? Did I bring a smile to someone's face? Did I say words of healing? Did I let go of my anger and resentment? Did I forgive? Did I love?' These are the real questions. I must trust that the little bit of love that I sow now will be many fruits, here in this world and the life to come."
3634,
3635,"When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives mean the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand. The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing, not curing, not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that is a friend who cares."
3636,"Joy does not simply happen to us. We have to choose joy and keep choosing it every day. It is a choice based on the knowledge that we belong to God and have found in God our refuge and our safety and that nothing, not even death, can take God away from us."
3637,"This is what life is about. It is being sent on a trip by a loving God, who is waiting at home for our return and is eager to watch the slides we took and hear about the friends we made. When we travel with the eyes and ears of the God who sent us, we will see wonderful sights, hear wonderful sounds, meet wonderful people ... and be happy to return home."
3638,Hope is willing to leave unanswered questions unanswered and unknown futures unknown. Hope makes you see God's guiding hand not only in the gentle and pleasant moments but also in the shadows of disappointment and darkness.
3639,"What makes us human is not our mind but our heart, not our ability to think but our ability to love."
3640,"It is in solitude that we discover that being is more important than having and that we are worth more than the results of our efforts. 
 In solitude we discover that our life is not a possession to be defended but a gift to be shared."
3641,"Friendship is one of the greatest gifts a human being can receive. It is a bond beyond common goals, common interests, or common histories. It is a bond stronger than sexual union can create, deeper than a shared fate can solidify, and even more intimate than the bonds of marriage or community. Friendship is being with the other in joy and sorrow, even when we cannot increase the joy or decrease the sorrow. It is a unity of souls that gives nobility and sincerity to love. Friendship makes all of life shine brightly."
3642,Waiting time is not wasting time. Waiting patiently in expectation is the foundation of the spiritual life.
3643,"In a world so torn apart by rivalry, anger, and hatred, we have the privileged vocation to be living signs of a love that can bridge all divisions and heal all wounds."
3644,Forgiveness changes the way we remember. It converts the curse into a blessing. Forgiveness indeed heals memories . . .
3645,You don't think your way into a new kind of living. You live your way into a new kind of thinking.
3646,"But what I would like to say is that the spiritual life is a life in which you gradually learn to listen to a voice that says something else, that says, ""You are the beloved and on you my favour rests.""... I want you to hear that voice. It is not a very loud voice because it is an intimate voice. It comes from a very deep place. It is soft and gentle. I want you to gradually hear that voice. We both have to hear that voice and to claim for ourselves that that voice speaks the truth, our truth. It tells us who we are."
3647,"Those we most love cause us not only great joy but also great pain. LOVE is stronger than fear, life stronger than death, hope stronger than despair. We have to trust that the risk of loving is always worth taking."
3648,"Spiritual maturity is not knowing what to do with your whole life, but just knowing what to do next."
3649,"We are called to be fruitful - not successful, not productive, not accomplished. Success comes from strength, stress, and human effort. Fruitfulness comes from vulnerability and the admission of our own weakness."
3650,"If you feel loved, you can do a thousand things. If you feel rejected, everything becomes a problem."
3651,Dare to love and to be a real friend. The love you give and receive is a reality that will lead you closer and closer to God as well as those whom God has given you to love.
3652,The only feelings that do not heal are the ones you hide.
3653,Self-rejection is the greatest enemy of the spiritual life because it contradicts the sacred voice that calls us the Beloved.
3654,Our life is...a time in which sadness and joy kiss each other at every moment.
3655,
3656,"Simplify your life. Don't waste the years struggling for things that are unimportant. Don't burden yourself with possessions. Keep your needs and wants simple and enjoy what you have. Don't destroy your peace of mind by looking back, worrying about the past. Live in the present. Simplify!"
3657,"Think for yourself, or others will think for you without thinking of you."
3658,
3659,"What the essential difference between man and woman is, that they should be thus attracted to one another, no one has satisfactorily answered. Perhaps we must acknowledge the justness of the distinction which assigns to man the sphere of wisdom, and to woman that of love, though neither belongs exclusively to either. Man is continually saying to woman, Why will you not be more wise? Woman is continually saying to man, Why will you not be more loving? It is not in their wills to be wise or to be loving; but, unless each is both wise and loving, there can be neither wisdom nor love."
3660,Life isn't about finding yourself; it's about creating yourself. So live the life you imagined.
3661,
3662,Every oak tree started out as a couple of nuts who stood their ground.
3663,"As a single footstep will not make a path on the earth, so a single thought will not make a pathway in the mind. To make a deep physical path, we walk again and again. To make a deep mental path, we must think over and over the kind of thoughts we wish to dominate our lives."
3664,The little things in life are as interesting as the big ones.
3665,The only people who ever get anyplace interesting are the people who get lost.
3666,
3667,"Cultivate poverty like a garden herb, like sage."
3668,
3669,"To have made even one person's life a little better, that is to succeed."
3670,What lies behind us and what lies ahead of us are tiny matters compared to what lives within us.
3671,Do not engage to find things as you think they are.
3672,"Do not lose hold of your dreams or aspirations. For if you do, you may still exist but you have ceased to live."
3673,"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived."
3674,"If the machine of government is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then, I say, break the law."
3675,Dissent without action is consent.
3676,Maturity is when all of your mirrors turn into windows.
3677,"When we bring what is within out into the world, miracles happen."
3678,Truths and roses have thorns about them.
3679,Never look back unless you are planning to go that way.
3680,
3681,
3682,Greatest thing in life is experience. Even mistakes have value.
3683,Impossible means that you haven't found a solution yet .
3684,
3685,
3686,A poor man is not the one without a cent. A poor man is the one without a dream.
3687,
3688,Quality means doing it right when no one is looking.
3689,"Whether you believe you can or not, you're right."

3691,"Don't expect people to respect you for what you are ""planning"" to do."
3692,The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing.
3693,"Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young. The greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young."
3694,It has been my observation that most people get ahead during the time that others waste.
3695,The two most important things in any company do not appear in its balance sheet: its reputation and its people.
3696,
3697,
3698,"Don't find fault, find a remedy."
3699,It is failure that is easy. Success is always hard.
3700,"Three rules: I do not eat too much; I do not worry too much; and, if I do my best, I believe that what happens, happens for the best."
3701,"If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own."
3702,It's your thinking that decides whether you're going to succeed or fail.
3703,"The competitor to be feared is one who never bothers about you at all, but goes on making his own business better all the time."
3704,To do more for the world than the world does for you - that is success.
3705,
3706,
3707,"Life moves on, whether we act as cowards or heroes. Life has no other discipline to impose, if we would but realize it, than to accept life unquestioningly. Everything we shut our eyes to, everything we run away from, everything we deny, denigrate or despise, serves to defeat us in the end. What seems nasty, painful, evil, can become a source of beauty, joy, and strength, if faced with an open mind. Every moment is a golden one for him who has the vision to recognize it as such"

3792,Learn what is to be taken seriously and laugh at the rest.
3793,Theory is knowledge that doesn't work. Practice is when everything works and you don't know why.
3794,There is no reality except the one contained within us. That is why so many people live such an unreal life. They take the images outside them for reality and never allow the world within to assert itself.

3802,"Beauty does not bring happiness to the one who possesses it, but to the one who loves and admires it."
3803,Loneliness is the way by which destiny endeavors to lead man to himself.
3804,You are only afraid if you are not in harmony with yourself. People are afraid because they have never owned up to themselves.
3805,
3806,
3807,"Sanders is to blame for my loss, along with Obama and Biden. They never really supported me because I'm a woman. They're all deplorables, just like every registered Republican in America."

3828,"If I want to knock a story off the front page, I just change my hairstyle."
3829,You cannot have development in today's world without partnering with the private sector.
3830,
3831,The greatest medicine of all is teaching people how not to need it
3832,
3833,"Everyone has a doctor in him or her; we just have to help it in its work. The natural healing force within each one of us is the greatest force in getting well. Our food should be our medicine. Our medicine should be our food. But to eat when you are sick, is to feed your sickness."

3843,The natural force within each of us is that greatest healer of all.
3844,
3845,"Positive health requires a knowledge of man's primary constitution and of the powers of various foods, both those natural to them and those resulting from human skill. But eating alone is not enough for health. There must also be exercise, of which the effects must likewise be known. The combination of these two things makes regimen, when proper attention is given to the season of the year, the changes of the wind, the age of the individual, and the situation of his home. If there is any deficiency in food or exercise, the body will fall sick."
3846,"Wherever the art of Medicine is loved, there is also a love of Humanity."
3847,"Just as food causes chronic disease, it can be the most powerful cure"

3903,"The higher the tower, the greater the fall thereof."

Our problem is that people all over the world have obeyed the dictates of leaders…and millions have been killed because of this obedience…Our problem is that people are obedient allover the world in the face of poverty and starvation and stupidity, and war, and cruelty. Our problem is that people are obedient while the jails are full of petty thieves… (and) the grand thieves are running the country. That’s our problem."
3906,
3907,"To be hopeful in bad times is based on the fact that human history is not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness. If we see only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something. If we remember those times and places where people have behaved magnificently, this gives us the energy to act. And if we do act, in however small a way, we don't have to wait for some grand Utopian future. The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory."

3911,"If patriotism were defined, not as blind obedience to government, not as submissive worship to flags and anthems, but rather as love of one's country, one's fellow citizens (all over the world), as loyalty to the principles of justice and democracy, then patriotism would require us to disobey our government, when it violated those principles."
3912,
3913,"Small acts, when multiplied by millions of people, can transform the world."
3914,"When I say history is a matter of life and death, I mean this: If you really don't know history, you are a victim of whatever the authorities tell you. You have no way of checking up on them. You have no way of deciding whether there is any truth in what they are saying."
3915,"I am convinced that imprisonment is a way of pretending to solve the problem of crime. It does nothing for the victims of crime, but perpetuates the idea of retribution, thus maintaining the endless cycle of violence in our culture. It is a cruel and useless substitute for the elimination of those conditions--poverty, unemployment, homelessness, desperation, racism, greed--which are at the root of most punished crime. The crimes of the rich and powerful go mostly unpunished."

3923,"I see this as the central issue of our time: how to find a substitute for war in human ingenuity, imagination, courage, sacrifice, patience... War is not inevitable, however persistent it is, however long a history it has in human affairs. It does not come out of some instinctive human need. It is manufactured by political leaders, who then must make a tremendous effort--by enticement, by propaganda, by coercion--to mobilize a normally reluctant population to go to war."
3924,"History is instructive. And what it suggests to people is that even if they do little things, if they walk on the picket line, if they join a vigil, if they write a letter to their local newspaper. Anything they do, however small, becomes part of a much, much larger sort of flow of energy. And when enough people do enough things, however small they are, then change takes place."
3925,"Because of the control of the media by corporate wealth, the discovery of truth depends on an alternative media, such as small radio stations, networks, programs. Also, alternative newspapers, which exist all over the country. Also, cable TV programs, which are not dependent on commercial advertising. Also, the internet, which can reach millions of people by-passing the conventional media."
3926,"Memorial Day will be celebrated ... by the usual betrayal of the dead, by the hypocritical patriotism of the politicians and contractors preparing for more wars, more graves to receive more flowers on future Memorial Days.

3927,"George Orwell said, ""Whoever controls the past controls the future,"" by which he meant that history is incredibly important in shaping the world view of the next generation of people."
3928,The problem in this world is not civil disobedience...th e problem in this world is civil obedience.
3929,"One percent of the nation owns a third of the wealth. The rest of the wealth is distributed in such a way as to turn those in the 99 percent against one another: small property owners against the propertyless, black against white, native-born against foreign-born, intellectuals and professionals against the uneducated and the unskilled. These groups have resented one another and warred against one another with such vehemence and violence as to obscure their common position as sharers of leftovers in a very wealthy country."
3930,
3931,We are living in dangerously weird times now. Smart people just shrug and admit they're dazed and confused. The only ones left with any confidence at all are the New Dumb. It is the beginning of the end of our world as we knew it. Doom is the operative ethic.
3932,Life has become immeasurably better since I have been forced to stop taking it seriously.
3933,The downward spiral of Dumbness in America is about to hit a new low.
3934,Insanity is a legal term. Crazy is an art form.
3935,The main problem in any democracy is that crowd-pleasers are generally brainless swine who can go out on a stage & whup their supporters into an orgiastic frenzy - then go back to the office & sell every one of the poor bastards down the tube for a nickel apiece. Probably the rarest form of life in American politics is the man who can turn on a crowd & still keep his head straight - assuming it was straight in the first place.
3936,"We are all alone, born alone, die alone, and -- in spite of True Romance magazines -- we shall all someday look back on our lives and see that, in spite of our company, we were alone the whole way. I do not say lonely -- at least, not all the time -- but essentially, and finally, alone. This is what makes your self-respect so important, and I don't see how you can respect yourself if you must look in the hearts and minds of others for your happiness."
3937,"When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro."
3938,"Every man is the sum total of his reactions to experience. As your experiences differ and multiply, you become a different man, and hence your perspective changes. This goes on and on. Every reaction is a learning process; every significant experience alters your perspective."
3939,I learned a long time ago that reality was much weirder than anyone's imagination.
3940,Hope rises and dreams flicker and die. Love plans for tomorrow and loneliness thinks of yesterday. Life is beautiful and living is pain.
3941,Human beings are the only creatures on earth that claim a God and the only thing that behaves like it hasn't got one.
3942,Beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life. Decide how you want to live and then see what you can do to make a living WITHIN that way of life.
3943,"Anybody who thinks that 'it doesn't matter who's President' has never been Drafted and sent off to fight and die in a vicious, stupid war on the other side of the world-or been beaten and gassed by Police for trespassing on public property-or been hounded by the IRS for purely political reasons-or locked up in the Cook County Jail with a broken nose and no phone access and twelve perverts wanting to stomp your ass in the shower. That is when it matters who is President or Governor or Police Chief. That is when you will wish you had voted."
3944,"On some nights, I still believe that a car with the gas needle on empty can run about fifty more miles if you have the right music very loud on the radio."

3947,A man who procrastinates in his choosing will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance.

3950,"Never turn your back on fear. It should always be in front of you, like a thing that might have to be killed."
3951,"So we shall let the reader answer this question for himself: who is the happier man, he who has braved the storm of life and lived or he who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed?"
3952,Never fire a warning shot. It is a waste of ammunition.
3953,"Coming of age in a fascist police state will not be a barrel of fun for anybody, much less for people like me, who are not inclined to suffer Nazis gladly and feel only contempt for the cowardly flag-suckers who would gladly give up their outdated freedom to live for the mess of pottage they have been conned into believing will be freedom from fear."
3954,Love plans for tomorrow and loneliness thinks of yesterday.
3955,
3956,Anyone who criticizes you cares about your friendship. Anyone who makes light of your faults cares nothing about you.
3957,"If you advise someone on the condition that they have to accept it, then you are an oppressor."
3958,"What indicates a person’s weak religion and fear of God, is that he seeks for an opinion that suits his desire."
3959,Truthfulness is composed of justice and courage.
3960,"Do not use your energy except for a cause more noble than yourself. Such a cause cannot be found except in Almighty God Himself: to preach the truth, to defend womanhood, to repel humiliation which your Creator has not imposed upon you, to help the oppressed. Anyone who uses his energy for the sake of the vanities of the world is like someone who exchanges gemstones for gravel. There is no nobility in anyone who lacks faith. The wise man knows that the only fitting price for his soul is a place in Paradise."
3961,There are two things that if you do them you will attain the good of this world and the hereafter; [They are] that you bear what you dislike if it is beloved to Allah and you leave what you like if it is disliked by Allah.
3962,One hour of neglect can undo a year of pious effort.
3963,"""When we contemplate the duration of the universe, we see it limited to the present moment, which is nothing more but the point which separates two infinities of time. The past and the future are as meaningless as if they did not exist. Is anyone more misguided than the man who barters an eternal future for a moment which passes quicker than the blink of an eye?."""
3964,Glad-tidings to he who knows his own faults more than other people know it.

3967,"Anyone who rises above the things of this world, to which you kneel, is mightier than you."
3968,"Of Love--may God exalt you! -the first part is jesting, and the last part is right earnestness. So majestic are its diverse aspects, they are too subtle to be described; their reality can only be apprehended by personal experience. Love is neither disapproved by Religion, nor prohibited by the Law; for every heart is in God's hands."
3969,The wise man knows the only fitting price for his soul is a place in Paradise.
3970,"If you are proud of your descent from virtuous ancestors, how empty their virtue will leave your hands if you yourself are not virtuous. How little pride your ancestors will have in you in this world and the next if you do no good! All men are children of Adam whom Allah created by His own Hands, giving him paradise for a dwelling place and letting His angels bow down before him. But how little is the advantage from this since all the vices dwell in mankind and all the wicked impious people are among their number."
3971,"Two kinds of people live a life without care: one kind are extremely worthy of praise, the other kind are extremely worthy of criticism. The first are those who care nothing for the pleasures of the world and the second (i.e. those who are deserving of criticism) care nothing for haya or modesty."
3972,"If there is someone in need whom you wish to help, whether the initiative came from him or from you, do no more than he expects of you, not what you might personally wish to do. If you overstep the mark, you will not deserve thanks, but blame from him and others and you will attract hostility, not friendship."
3973,"No one is moved to act, or resolves to speak a single word, who does not hope by means of this action or word to release anxiety from his spirit."
3974,We should think of those who were famous for their good deeds or their bad deeds; did their fame raise them one single degree in the sight of Allah. Did it win them a reward that they had not already won by their actions during their life?
3975,"And though the years before I die 
 Stretch out interminably, I 
 Shall only count my life in truth 
 As that brief hour of happy youth."
3976,
3977,"A real man is one who fears the death of his heart, not of his body."
3978,"Happiness is attained by three things: being patient when tested, being thankful when receiving a blessing, and being repentant upon sinning."
3979,When Allah tests you it is never to destroy you. When He removes something in your possession it is only in order to empty your hands for an even greater gift.
3980,A person’s tongue can give you the taste of his heart.
3981,"If a heart becomes attached to anything other than Allah, Allah makes him dependent on what he is attached to. And he will be betrayed by it."

3984,Be sincere in your aim and you will find the support of Allaah surrounding you.
3985,"Had Allah lifted the veil for his slave and shown him how He handles his affairs for him, and how Allah is more keen for the benefit of the slave than his own self, his heart would have melted out of the love for Allah and would have been torn to pieces out of thankfulness to Allah. Therefore if the pains of this world tire you, do not grieve. For it may be that Allah wishes to hear your voice by way of Dua'a. So pour out your desires in prostration and forget about it and know; that verily Allah does not forget it."
3986,Women are one half of society which gives birth to the other half so it is as if they are the entire society.

3989,"Truly in the heart there is a void that can not be removed except with the company of Allah. And in it there is a sadness that can not be removed except with the happiness of knowing Allah and being true to Him. And in it there is an emptiness that can not be filled except with love for Him and by turning to Him and always remembering Him. And if a person were given all of the world and what is in it, it would not fill this emptiness."
3990,"A slave stands infront of Allah on two occasions. The first during salah, and secondly on the Day of Judgment. Whoseover stands correctly in the first, the second standing will be made easier for him. And whosoever, disregards the first standing, the second standing will be extremely difficult."
3991,"If you wish to check how much you love Allah, then see how much your heart loves the Quran, and you will know the answer."
3992,"When Allah granted Prophet Yoosuf (`alayhis-Salaam) physical beauty it caused him to be locked up in the prison; but when Allah granted him knowledge (when he interpreted the dream of the king) it not only took him out of prison, but elevated his rank in society, clearly showing us the virtue of knowledge and that physical beauty does not mean anything."

3997,Sitting with the poor and less fortunate people removes the ego and pride from your heart.
3998,"Be to Allah as He wishes, and He will be to you more than you can wish for."
3999,The soul will never become pious and purified except through undergoing afflictions. It is the same as gold that can never be pure except after removing all the base metals in it.
4000,"From the perfection of Allah's ihsan is that He allows His slave to taste the bitterness of the break before the sweetness of the mend. So He does not break his believing slave, except to mend him. And He does not withhold from him, except to give him. And He does not test him (with hardship), except to cure him."
4001,
4002,Don’t depend too much on anyone in this world because even your own shadow leaves you when you are in darkness.
4003,"What really counts are good endings, not flawed beginnings."
4004,A calamity that makes you turn to Allah is better for you then a blessing which makes you forget the remembrance of Allah
4005,"If I remained silent and you remained silent, then who will teach the ignorant?"
4006,"What can my enemies do to me? My paradise is in my heart, it is with me wherever I go. To imprison me is to provide me with seclusion. To send me into exile is to send me away in the Path of Allah. And to kill me is to make me a martyr."
4007,"The disease that knowledge brings is arrogance, and the disease that worship brings is showing off"
4008,"Allah will support the just state even if it is led by unbelievers, but Allah will not support the oppressive state even if it is led by believers"
4009,Dhikr (remembrance of Allah) is to the heart as water is to a fish; see what happens to a fish when it is taken out of water
4010,"Seek (beneficial) knowledge, 
 because seeking it for the sake of Allaah is a worship. 
 And knowing it makes you more God-fearing; 
 and searching for it is jihad, 
 teaching it to those who do not know is charity, 
 reviewing and learning it more is like tasbeeh. 
 Through knowledge Allaah will be known and worshiped."
4011,The sincere hearts and the pious supplications are soldiers which can never be defeated
4012,"You should not look at what the person used to do, rather you should 
 look at what kind of person they are today. The one who gets bogged 
 down about people's pasts, is just like Iblees who said to Allaah, 
 “You created me from fire and you created him from clay”."
4013,"Make tawba not just for sins you've committed, but also for obligations you haven't fulfilled."
4014,"It is strange that a person may find it easy to protect himself from: eating Haraam, oppression and injustice, adultery, theft, drinking khamr (alcoholic drinks), and from unlawful looking, but it is hard for him to restrain the movement of his tongue. How often do we see people who are very cautious about falling into shameful deeds or injustice, but their tongue lashes against the living and the dead and they don't mind it?"
4015,"If you do good in secret, Allah will shower His good on you in public."
4016,"When people help one another in sin and transgression, they finish by hating each other."
4017,"How many of us would be able to overcome our desires and resist the temptation of sin? How many of us even lower our gaze when we look upon something that we are not supposed to? The real prisoner is the one whose heart has been kept away from remembering his Lord, and the real captive is the one who has been captivated by his whims and desires."
4018,Guidance is not attained except with knowledge and correct direction is not attained except with patience.
4019,"When someone offends me, I think it’s a gift from Allah (god). He (Allah) is teaching me humility."
4020,"Everyone experiences bouts of jealousy; but the dignified person conceals it, while the vulgar one acts upon it"
4021,"A believer to another believer is like two hands, one washes the other (correcting each other)."
4022,"Whatever is not done by the permission of Allah will not happen, and what is not done for the sake of Allah will not benefit or remain."
4023,"Allah guards the justice loving government, even if it is the government of non-Muslims, and destroys the tyrant government, even if it is the government of Muslims."
4024,"The highest degree of love is Tatayyum (total enthrallment). The lowest degree is 'alaqah (attachment), when the heart is attached to the beloved: then comes sabahah (infatuation), when the heart is poured out: then gharam (passion), when love never leaves the heart: the nashaq (ardent love), and finally tatayyum."
4025,"Beautiful leaving (hajr), is to leave without harming, beautiful pardoning is to pardon without rebuking, and beautiful patience is to be patient without complaining."

4035,
4036,I think the worst thing you can do about a situation is nothing.
4037,"Sometimes, when you want to laugh, reality steps in."
4038,"Money comes and goes, but your inner feelings, your gut feelings, your manhood, your womanhood, whatever, that stays with you. That don't go anywhere. So you either proud of who you are and how you handle situations or you not. If you handle a situation wrong, you, it will haunt you."
4039,"If I only had 24 hours to live, I would spend the time telling everybody I love that I love them."

4047,"I wish the world would become what God wanted it to be in the first place, before we tampered with it."
4048,"I think people, if you really want to be happy, you have to find God yourself, and you're going to have to have a personal, one-on-one relationship and not look to get through these traditions or these rituals and all this crazy stuff when you could talk to him right here, right now, anytime, anywhere, any place, from any position. And that's the kind of relationship you want, not a standard."
4049,"You can do anything in the world if you say ""Hey man, don't blame me, the devil made me do it. It's an easy way to escape responsibility."""
4050,"If you give anybody the chance, they can always make a decent human being out of themselves. It's the people that don't have a chance, that we look down at like they're monsters or they're animals or that they want something different than the rest of us."
4051,
4052,"We recognize a tree by its fruit, and we ought to be able to recognize a Christian by his action.  The fruit of faith should be evident in our lives, for being a Christian is more than making sound professions of faith.  It should reveal itself in practical and visible ways.  Indeed it is better to keep quiet about our beliefs, and live them out, than to talk eloquently about what we believe, but fail to live by it."
4053,"Do not have Jesus Christ on your lips, and the world in your heart."
4054,"My dear Jesus, my Savior, is so deeply written in my heart, that I feel confident, that if my heart were to be cut open and chopped to pieces, the name of Jesus would be found written on every piece."

4057,"See that ye all follow the bishop, even as Jesus Christ does the Father, and the presbytery as ye would the apostles; and reverence the deacons, as being the institution of God. Let no man do anything connected with the Church without the bishop. [] Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church. [] Whatsoever [the bishop] shall approve of, that is also pleasing to God, so that everything that is done may be secure and valid."
4058,"It is right, therefore, that we not just be called Christians, but that we actually be Christians."
4059,"I am writing to all the Churches and I enjoin all, that I am dying willingly for God's sake, if only you do not prevent it. I beg you, do not do me an untimely kindness. Allow me to be eaten by the beasts, which are my way of reaching to God. I am God's wheat, and I am to be ground by the teeth of wild beasts, so that I may become the pure bread of Christ."
4060,"Take heed often to come together to give thanks to God and show forth His praise. For when you assemble frequently in the same place, the powers of Satan are destroyed, and the destruction at which he aims is prevented by the unity of your faith."
4061,"It is impossible for a man to be freed from the habit of sin before he hates it, just as it is impossible to receive forgiveness before confessing his trespasses."
4062,"No earthly pleasures, no kingdoms of this world can benefit me in any way. I prefer death in Christ Jesus to power over the farthest limits of the earth. He who died in place of us is the one object of my quest. He who rose for our sakes is my one desire. Do not talk about Jesus Christ as long as you love this world."
4063,Do everything as if He were dwelling in us. Thus we shall be His temples and He will be within us as our God - as He actually is.
4064,"Now do I begin to be a disciple of Christ, and care for nothing in this world, that so I may find Jesus. Let fire, or the cross, or wild beasts, or the breaking of my bones, or the cutting of me to pieces, or the shattering of my whole body, yea, all the tortures of the devil - let them all come upon me, only let me enjoy my God."
4065,"Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church."
4066,"I wish not merely to be called Christian, but also to be Christian."
4067,"A Christian is not his own master, since all his time belongs to God."
4068,"It is not that I want merely to be called a Christian, but actually to be one. Yes, if I prove to be one, then I can have the name."
4069,"But look at the men who have those perverted notions about the grace of Jesus Christ which has come down to us, and see how contrary to the mind of God they are. . . . They even abstain from the Eucharist and from the public prayers, because they will not admit that the Eucharist is the self-same body of our Savior Jesus Christ which flesh suffered for our sins, and which the Father of His goodness raised up again."
4070,"I hunger for the bread of God, the flesh of Jesus Christ ...; I long to drink of his blood, the gift of unending love."
4071,"Be careful, therefore, to take part only in the one Eucharist; for there is only one Flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ and one cup to unite us with His Blood."
4072,Our task is not one of producing persuasive propaganda; Christianity shows its greatness when it is hated by the world.
4073,"Let no man's place, or dignity, or riches, puff him up; and let no man's low condition or poverty abase him. For the chief points are faith towards God, hope towards Christ, the enjoyment of those good things for which we look, and love towards God and our neighbor."
4074,I would rather die and come to Jesus Christ than be king over the entire earth. Him I seek who died for us; Him I love who rose again because of us.
4075,"For Faith is the beginning and the end is love, and God is the two of them brought into unity. After these comes whatever else makes up a Christian gentleman."
4076,
4077,"It is not expensive to be beautiful. It takes only a little effort to be presentable and beautiful. But it takes some effort. And unfortunately people think of beauty as luxury, beauty as frivolity, ... or extravagance. Beauty is a discipline, beauty is art, is harmony, in the ideological sense and in the theological sense, beauty is God and love made real. And the ultimate reach in this world is beauty."
4078,"I did not have three thousand pairs of shoes, I had one thousand and sixty."

4082,"If you know how rich you are, you are not rich. But me, I am not aware of the extent of my wealth. That's how rich we are."
4083,"Doesn't the fight for survival also justify swindle and theft? In self defence, anything goes."

4086,"Perception is real, truth is not. I'm not fighting for money and possessions. I'm fighting for something more precious. I pray that as we enter the cyber age -- the Age of Transparency -- the facts and the truth will out."
4087,I am beyond logic and rationality.
4088,"I really had no great love for shoes. I was a working First Lady; I was always in canvas shoes. I did nurture the shoes industry of the Philippines, and so every time there was a shoe fair, I would receive a pair of shoes as a token of gratitude."
4089,"In the material world, where everything is valued, when you commit yourself to God, beauty and love, it can be mistaken for extravagance."
4090,"The Marcos era was the golden time for the Philippines. We had the lowest crime rate in the world in Manila and real development then. At last, people are starting to understand this."
4091,"I am my little people's star and slave. When I go out into the barrios, I get dressed because I know my little people want to see a star. Other presidents' wives have gone to the barrios wearing house dresses and slippers. That's not what people want to see. People want someone they can love, someone to set an example."
4092,"It is shallow people who think beauty is frivolous or excessive. If you are bringing beauty and god, you are enriching the country. Rice feeds the body, books feed the mind, beauty feeds the soul. It is one thing I can really be proud of and stand tall in the world."
4093,Never dress down for the poor. They won't respect you for it. They want their First Lady to look like a million dollars.
4094,I hate ugliness. You know I'm allergic to ugliness.
4095,Beauty is not extravagance; beauty is life.

4106,"If you punish a child for being naughty, and reward him for being good, he will do right merely for the sake of the reward; and when he goes out into the world and finds that goodness is not always rewarded, nor wickedness always punished, he will grow into a man who only thinks about how he may get on in the world, and does right or wrong according as he finds advantage to himself."

4118,"Enlightenment is man's leaving his self-caused immaturity. Immaturity is the incapacity to use one's intelligence without the guidance of another. Such immaturity is self-caused if it is not caused by lack of intelligence, but by lack of determination and courage to use one's intelligence without being guided by another. Sapere Aude! Have the courage to use your own intelligence! is therefore the motto of the enlightenment."

4176,"I said, ""I don't think I can give you that kind of emotion."" And he [Hitchcock] sat there and said, ""Ingrid, fake it!"" Well, that was the best advice I've had in my whole life, because in all the years to come there were many directors who gave me what I thought were quite impossible instructions and many difficult things to do, and just when I was on the verge of starting to argue with them, I heard his voice coming to me through the air saying, ""Ingrid, fake it!"" It saved a lot of unpleasant situations and waste of time."
4177,"I don't worry about it because we are all growing old. If I were the only one I would worry. But we're all in the same boat, and all of my friends are coming with me. We all go toward old age. How many years left we don't know. We just have to accept it."

4198,"One of the secrets of a happy life is continuous small treats, and if some of these can be inexpensive and quickly procured so much the better."
4199,"Education doesn’t make you happy. Nor does freedom. We don’t become happy just because we’re free – if we are. Or because we’ve been educated – if we have. But because education may be the means by which we realize we are happy. It opens our eyes, our ears, tells us where delights are lurking, convinces us that there is only one freedom of any importance whatsoever, that of the mind, and gives us the assurance – the confidence – to walk the path our mind, our educated mind, offers."

4211,"When does one ever know a human being? Perhaps only after one has realized the impossibility of knowledge and renounced the desire for it and finally ceased to feel even the need of it. But then what one achieves is no longer knowledge, it is simply a kind of co-existence; and this too is one of the guises of love."
4212,"Most of our love is shabby stuff, but there is always a thin line of gold, the bit of pure love on which all the rest depends -- and which redeems all the rest."

4242,Train yourselves. Don't wait to be fed knowledge out of a book. Get out and seek it. Make explorations. Do your own research work. Train your hands and your mind. Become curious. Invent your own problems and solve them. You can see things going on all about you. Inquire into them. Seek out answers to your own questions. There are many phenomena going on in nature the explanation of which cannot be found in books. Find out why these phenomena take place. Information a boy gets by himself is enormously more valuable than that which is taught to him in school.
4243,Only a small part of scientific progress has resulted from planned search for specific objectives.  A much more important part has been made possible by the freedom of the individual to follow his own curiosity.

4250,"[In the case of research director, Willis R. Whitney, whose style was to give talented investigators as much freedom as possible, you may define ""serendipity"" as] the art of profiting from unexpected occurrences. When you do things in that way you get unexpected results. Then you do something else and you get unexpected results in another line, and you do that on a third line and then all of a sudden you see that one of these lines has something to do with the other. Then you make a discovery that you never could have made by going on a direct road."
4251,And literature frequently rises to heights that make it international.
4252,"Many of the things that have happened in the laboratory have happened in ways it would have been impossible to foresee, but not impossible to plan for in a sense. I do not think Dr. Whitney deliberately plans his serendipity but he is built that way; he has the art-an instinctive way of preparing himself by his curiosity and by his interest in people and in all kinds of things and in nature, so that the things he learns react on one another and thereby accomplish things that would be impossible to foresee and plan."
4253,"[There] are cases where there is no dishonesty involved but where people are tricked into false results by a lack of understanding about what human beings can do to themselves in the way of being led astray by subjective effects, wishful thinking or threshold interactions. These are examples of pathological science. These are things that attracted a great deal of attention. Usually hundreds of papers have been published upon them. Sometimes they have lasted for fifteen or twenty years and then they gradually die away."

I personally resent it bitterly."

They have convinced themselves that man, the worst transgressor of all the species, is the crown of creation. All other creatures were created merely to provide him with food, pelts, to be tormented, exterminated. In relation to them, all people are Nazis; for the animals it is an eternal Treblinka."
4295,We must believe in free will - we have no choice.

4297,"It is a general rule that when the grain of truth cannot be found, men will swallow great helpings of falsehood."
4298,"In their behavior toward creatures, all men are Nazis. Human beings see oppression vividly when they're the victims. Otherwise they victimize blindly and without a thought."

4302,"If you keep saying things are going to be bad, you have a good chance of being a prophet."
4303,"There are 500 reasons I write for children.... Children read books, not reviews. They don't give a hoot about the critics.... They don't read to free themselves of guilt, to quench their thirst for rebellion, or to get rid of alienation. They still believe in God, the family, angels, devils, witches, goblins, logic, clarity, punctuation, and other such obsolete stuff.... They don't expect their beloved writer to redeem humanity. Young as they are, they know that it is not in his power. Only the adults have such childish illusions."

4392,"No matter what is going on in your life today, remember, it is only preparation. People come and go; situations rise and fall; it's all preparation for better things.

This is the time when you must stand toe to toe, eyeball to eyeball, with the very thing you have tried desperately to avoid. In that moment, when there is nothing standing between you and the thing you fear the most, you will be forced to step into your greatness, because that is what life is demanding of you."
4398,"The journey into self-love and self-acceptance must begin with self-examination. ... until you take the journey of self-reflection, it is almost impossible to grow or learn in life."
4399,Your willingness to look at your darkness is what empowers you to change
4400,"Forgiveness is a process of giving up the old for something new. Old experiences and memories that we hold on to in anger, resentment, shame, or guilt cloud our spirit mind. The truth is, everything that has happened had to happen. It was a growth experience. There was something you needed to know or learn. If you stay angry, hurt, afraid, ashamed, or guilty, you miss the lesson. You will be stuck in a cloud of pain."
4401,"Every day is your day if you claim it. If you wait for somebody else to make it for you, you're going to be disappointed."
4402,"Nothing destroys self-worth, self-acceptance and self-love faster than denying what you feel. Without feelings, you would not know where you are in life. Nor would you know what areas you need to work on. Honor your feelings. Allow yourself to feel them."
4403,"Each day, focus your attention on what you want. Each day, take one step that will bring you closer to it. ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE! The key is to identify it, claim it for yourself, and believe that you are worthy to have it."
4404,"The highest form of praise you can offer to yourself, to God and to the world is to spend time each day expressing gratitude. It says to God that you are aware and appreciative of grace. It says to life that you are acknowledging its awesome presence in you. It says to yourself that you are worth the time it takes to be healed. Time spent in silence, contemplation and gratitude is time spent in devotion to a higher calling and a more loving state of being."
4405,"It's important that we share our experiences with other people. Your story will heal you and your story will heal somebody else. When you tell your story, you free yourself and give other people permission to acknowledge their own story"
4406,"You cannot make your life move faster than it's moving. No matter how urgent your situation may seem to be, things are going to happen when they happen, not a minute sooner. Be patient with yourself. Be patient with others. Be patient with life. Patience always pays off."
4407,"Have the courage to be exactly who you are without apology. Admit your mistakes without beating yourself up. Release all shame! Release all guilt! You cannot live if you are hiding behind what was. Focus on what is, right now, and that is you!"
4408,"When you can tell the story and it doesn't bring up any pain, you know it is healed."

4412,Challenges come so we can grow and be prepared for things we are not equipped to handle now.
4413,Stop hiding! Stop holding yourself back and playing yourself down! Stop worrying about how you look and what people are saying. Stop listening to what people are saying and trying to find out if they are whispering about you. Stop waiting for someone to tell you that you are okay or to make you feel special. Life is special! It is a special gift. This is your life! Now take your gift and live it out in the open! Decide today that you are going to live out loud!
4414,"You can accept or reject the way you are treated by other people, but until you heal the wounds of your past, you will continue to bleed. You can bandage the bleeding with food, with alcohol, with drugs, with work, with cigarettes, with sex, but eventually, it will all ooze through and stain your life. You must find the strength to open the wounds, stick your hands inside, pull out the core of the pain that is holding you in your past, the memories, and make peace with them."
4415,"When the time comes for you to make a change or to grow, the universe will make you so uncomfortable you will eventually have no choice."
4416,"If you should encounter angry or unkind actions today, take a deep breath, reach deep within and greet the lack of love with love."
4417,"It costs something to be a real Christian, according to the standard of the Bible. There are enemies to be overcome, battles to be fought, sacrifices to be made, an Egypt to be forsaken, a wilderness to be passed through, a cross to be carried, a race to be run. Conversion is not putting a person in an arm-chair and taking them easily to heaven. It is the beginning of a mighty conflict, in which it costs much to win the victory."
4418,"Trials are intended to make us think, to wean us from the world, to send us to the Bible, to drive us to our knees."
4419,"If you love Christ, never be ashamed to let others see it and know it. Speak for Him. Witness for Him. Live for Him."
4420,"Read the Bible daily. Make it part of your everyday business to read and meditate on some portion of God's Word. Gather your manna fresh every morning. Choose your own seasons and hours. Do not scramble over and hurry your reading. Give your Bible the best, and not the worst, part of your time. But whatever plan you pursue, let it be a rule of your life to visit the throne of grace and the Bible every day."
4421,"Beware of manufacturing a God of your own: a God who is all mercy, but not just; a God who is all love, but not holy; a God who as a heaven for every body, but a hell for none; a God who can allow good and bad to be side by side in time, but will make no distinction between good and broad in eternity. Such a God is an idol of your own, as truly an idol as any snake or crocodile in an Egyptian temple. The hands of your own fancy and sentimentality have made him. He is not the God of the Bible, and beside the God of the Bible there is no God at all."
4422,"We must give up the vain idea of trying to please everybody. That is impossible, and the attempt is a mere waste of time. We must be content to walk in Christ's steps, and let the world say what it likes."
4423,"Do nothing that you would not like God to see. Say nothing you would not like God to hear. Write nothing you would not like God to read. Go no place where you would not like God to find you. Read no book of which you would not like God to say, ""Show it to Me."" Never spend your time in such a way that you would not like to have God say, ""What are you doing?"
4424,"Praying and sinning will never live together in the same heart. Prayer will consume sin, or sin will choke prayer."
4425,"Fear not because your prayer is stammering, your words feeble, and your language poor. Jesus can understand you."
4426,"Let us seek friends that will stir up our prayers, our Bible reading, our use of time, and our salvation."
4427,"Let us cleave to Christ more closely, love Him more heartily, live to Him more thoroughly, copy Him more exactly, confess Him more boldly, and follow Him more fully."
4428,"My chief desire in all my writings, is to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ and make Him beautiful and glorious in the eyes of people; and to promote the increase of repentance, faith, and holiness upon earth."
4429,Let us beware of repentance without evidence.
4430,"Do not glory in your own faith, your own feelings, your own knowledge, or your own diligence. Glory in nothing but Christ."
4431,"A Christian is a walking sermon. They preach far more than a minister does, for they preach all week long."
4432,"If we are true Christians, we must not expect everything smooth in our journey to heaven. We must count it no strange thing, if we have to endure sicknesses, losses, bereavements, and disappointments, just like other men. Free pardon and full forgiveness, grace along the way, and glory at the endall this our Savior has promised to give. But He has never promised that we shall have no afflictions."
4433,"Our Lord has many weak children in his family, many dull pupils in his school, many raw soldiers in his army, many lame sheep in his flock. Yet he bears with them all, and casts none away. Happy is that Christian who has learned to do likewise with his brethren."
4434,"Are you tempted? Look unto Jesus. Are you afflicted? Look unto Jesus. Do all speak evil of you? Look unto Jesus. Do you feel cold, dull, and backsliding? Look unto Jesus."
4435,The highest form of selfishness is that of the man who is content to go to heaven alone.
4436,"Prayer needs neither learning, wisdom or book knowledge to begin it. It needs nothing but heart and will."
4437,"Until we give God our heart, we give Him nothing at all."
4438,True repentance begins with KNOWLEDGE of sin. It goes on to work SORROW for sin. It leads to CONFESSION of sin before God. It shows itself before a person by a thorough BREAKING OFF from sin. It results in producing a DEEP HATRED for all sin.
4439,"A religion that costs nothing is worth nothing. A cheap Christianity, without a cross, will prove in the end a useless Christianity, without a crown."
4440,"Except a man be born again, he will wish one day he had never been born at all."
4441,"By affliction He teaches us many precious lessons, which without it we should never learn. By affliction He shows us our emptiness and weakness, draws us to the throne of grace, purifies our affections, weans us from the world, makes us long for heaven."

4464,I would like to be remembered as someone who did the best she could with the talent she had.
4465,"The knowledge that you have emerged wiser and stronger from setbacks means that you are, ever after, secure in your ability to survive.

The crownless again shall be king."

4480,"The main mark of modern governments is that we do not know who governs, de facto any more than de jure. We see the politician and not his backer; still less the backer of the backer; or, what is most important of all, the banker of the backer."

4489,"There are truths, that are beyond us, transcendent truths, about beauty, truth, honor, etc. There are truths that man knows exist, but they cannot be seen - they are immaterial, but no less real, to us. It is only through the language of myth that we can speak of these truths."

4503,"We are free today substantially, but the day will come when our Republic will be an impossibility. It will be an impossibility because wealth will be concentrated in the hands of a few. A Republic cannot stand upon bayonets, and when the day comes when the wealth of the nation will be in the hands of a few, then we must rely upon the wisdom of the best elements in the country to readjust the laws of the nations to the changed conditions."
4504,

4579,The future is uncertain but the end is always near.
4580,"How can I set free anyone who doesn't have the guts to stand up alone and declare his own freedom? I think it's a lie - people claim they want to be free - everybody insists that freedom is what they want the most, the most sacred and precious thing a man can possess. But that's bullshit!

Treat your spouse with the flexibility and respect you would give to a top client. Think how we treat clients; We smile, we are polite, we listen to their ideas. Never forget that your spouse is your most important client."

4646,Learn to trust His timing. Don't get in a hurry; don't grow impatient; don't try to force doors open. Don't try to make things happen in your own strength. Let God do it His way.
4647,"Life's too short to spend it trying to keep others happy. You can't please everyone. To fulfill your destiny, stay true to your heart."
4648,"The more you talk about negative things in your life, the more you call them in. Speak victory not defeat."
4649,"The first place we lose the battle is in our own thinking. If you think it is permanent then it's permanent. If you think you've reached your limits then you have. If you think you will never get well then you won't. You have to change your thinking. You need to see everything that's holding you back, every obstacle, every limitation as only temporary."

4680,The hardest thing to see is what is in front of your eyes.
4681,"Nothing is more disgusting than the majority: because it consists of a few powerful predecessors, of rogues who adapt themselves, of weak who assimilate themselves, and the masses who imitate without knowing at all what they want."
4682,"I have come to the frightening conclusion that I am the decisive element. It is my personal approach that creates the climate. It is my daily mood that makes the weather....In all situations, it is my response that decides whether a crisis is escalated or de-escalated, and a person is humanized or is dehumanized."

Grace enough to confess your sins and forsake them. Patience enough to toil until some good is accomplished. Charity enough to see some good in your neighbor. Love enough to move you to be useful and helpful to others. Faith enough to make real the things of God. Hope enough to remove all anxious fears concerning the future.
4692,
4693,Nothing of significance was ever achieved by an individual acting alone.  Look below the surface and you will find that all seemingly solo acts are really team efforts.

4696,Your life today is a result of your thinking yesterday. Your life tomorrow will be determined by what you think today.
4697,You will never change your life until you change something you do daily. Success doesn't just suddenly occur one day in someone's life. Neither does failure. Each is a process. Every day of your life is merely preparation for the next. What you become is the result of what you do today.
4698,The only one you should compare yourself to is you. Your mission is to become better today than you were yesterday.

4707,"We cannot choose how many years we will live, but we can choose how much life those years will have. We cannot control the beauty of our face, but we can control the expression on it. We cannot control life's difficult moments but we can choose to make life less difficult. We cannot control the negative atmosphere of the world, but we can control the atmosphere of our minds. Too often we try to choose and control things we cannot. Too seldom we choose to control what we can ... our attitude."
4708,
4709,"Your attitude is either your best friend or your worst enemy, your 
greatest asset or your greatest liability"
4710,"So think long and hard about who you're spending the most time with, for wherever they are headed, so are you."

4725,Things do not happen. Things are made to happen.
4726,A nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.

4736,"We are not here to curse the darkness, but to light the candle that can guide us through that darkness to a safe and sane future."
4737,Those who dare to fail miserably can achieve greatly.
4738,"A full scale nuclear exchange, lasting less than 60 minutes...could wipe out more than 300 million Americans, Europeans, and Russians, as well as untold numbers elsewhere. And the survivors-as Chairman Khrushchev warned the Communist Chinese, `the survivors would envy the dead.' For they would inherit a world so devastated by explosions and poison and fire that today we cannot conceive of its horrors."
4739,Never let your fears hold you back from pursuing your hopes.
4740,A boy spends his time finding a girl to sleep with. A real man spends his time looking for the one worth waking up to.

4743,"Without Pain, How Could We Know Joy?"
4744,Good friends are hard to find and impossible to forget.
4745,"I'm not sure if I'm depressed. I mean, I'm not exactly sad. But I'm not exactly happy either. I can laugh and joke and smile during the day, But sometimes when I'm alone at night I forget how to feel."
4746,"We all want to do something to mitigate the pain of loss or to turn grief into something positive, to find a silver lining in the clouds. But I believe there is real value in just standing there, being still, being sad."
4747,"That's the thing about pain, it demands to be felt."
4748,You don't remember what happened. What you remember becomes what happened.
4749,

4754,Maybe our favorite quotations say more about us than about the stories and people we're quoting.
4755,Grief doesn't change you. It reveals you.
4756,"The good times and the bad times both will pass. It will pass. It will get easier. But the fact that it will get easier does not mean that it doesn’t hurt now. And when people try to minimize your pain they are doing you a disservice. And when you try to minimize your own pain you’re doing yourself a disservice. Don’t do that. The truth is that it hurts because it’s real. It hurts because it mattered. And that’s an important thing to acknowledge to yourself. But that doesn’t mean that it won’t end, that it won’t get better. Because it will."

4767,
4768,

4774,"When you do something noble and beautiful and nobody noticed, do not be sad. For the sun every morning is a beautiful spectacle and yet most of the audience still sleeps."
4775,"There are two basic motivating forces: fear and love. When we are afraid, we pull back from life. When we are in love, we open to all that life has to offer with passion, excitement, and acceptance. We need to learn to love ourselves first, in all our glory and our imperfections. If we cannot love ourselves, we cannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potential to create. Evolution and all hopes for a better world rest in the fearlessness and open-hearted vision of people who embrace life."

4788,"The trouble with government as it is, is that it doesn't represent the people. It controls them."
4789,Our society is run by insane people for insane objectives. I think we're being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and I think I'm liable to be put away as insane for expressing that. That's what's insane about it.

4792,
4793,"In EVERY situation and EVERY circumstance of your life, God is always doing a thousand different things that you cannot see and you do not know."
4794,What is sin? It is the glory of God not honored. The holiness of God not reverenced. The greatness of God not admired. The power of God not praised. The truth of God not sought. The wisdom of God not esteemed. The beauty of God not treasured. The goodness of God not savored. The faithfulness of God not trusted. The commandments of God not obeyed.

4796,"My feelings are not God. God is God. My feelings do not define truth. God’s word defines truth. My feelings are echoes and responses to what my mind perceives. And sometimes - many times - my feelings are out of sync with the truth. When that happens - and it happens every day in some measure - I try not to bend the truth to justify my imperfect feelings, but rather, I plead with God: Purify my perceptions of your truth and transform my feelings so that they are in sync with the truth."
4797,Sin is what you do when your heart is not satisfied with God.
4798,Life is not a straight line leading from one blessing to the next and then finally to heaven. Life is a winding and troubled road. Switchback after switchback. And the point of biblical stories like Joseph and Job and Esther and Ruth is to help us feel in our bones (not just know in our heads) that God is for us in all these strange turns. God is not just showing up after the trouble and cleaning it up. He is plotting the course and managing the troubles with far-reaching purposes for our good and for the glory of Jesus Christ.
4799,People don't enjoy salt. They enjoy what is salted. We are the salt of the earth. We do not exist for ourselves.
4800,"A Christian is not a person who believes in his head the teachings of the Bible. Satan believes in his head the teachings of the Bible!

4806,"If you live gladly to make others glad in God, your life will be hard, your risks will be high, and your joy will be full."
4807,"If you are sufficient for your task, it's too small."
4808,"If God's love for his children is to be measured by our health, wealth, and comfort in this life, God hated the apostle Paul."
4809,"Whenever your heart starts to be anxious about the future, preach to your heart and say, 'Heart, who do you think you are to be afraid of the future and nullify the promise of God? No, heart, I will not exalt myself with anxiety. I will humble myself in peace and joy as I trust this precious and great promise of God - He cares for me.'"
4810,"Life is wasted if we do not grasp the glory of the cross, cherish it for the treasure that it is, and cleave to it as the highest price of every pleasure and the deepest comfort in every pain.

4811,"God is always doing 10,000 things in your life, and you may be aware of three of them."
4812,Prayer is the open admission that without Christ we can do nothing. And prayer is the turning away from ourselves to God in the confidence that He will provide the help we need. Prayer humbles us as needy and exalts God as wealthy
4813,Worship is what we were created for. This is the final end of all existence-the worship of God. God created the universe so that it would display the worth of His glory. And He created us so that we would see this glory and reflect it by knowing and loving it-with all our heart and soul and mind and strength. The church needs to build a common vision of what worship is and what she is gathering to do on Sunday morning and scattering to do on Monday morning.
4814,A woman who fears the Lord will not run away from God to satisfy her longings and relieve her anxieties. She will wait for the Lord. She will hope in God. She will stay close to the heart of God and trust in his promises. The prospect of departing into the way of sin will be too fearful to pursue; and the benefits of abiding in the shadow of the Almighty too glorious to forsake.
4815,"O, God of wonder, enlarge my capacity to be amazed at what is amazing, and end my attraction to the insignificant."
4816,Don't ever think that the sin of your past means there is no hope for your future.
4817,
4818,"I think anyone's success depends on working hard, Industriousness and Enthusiasm, enjoying what you are doing. You can't work your best if you're not enjoying what you are doing. No way you can force yourself to."
4819,"A mistake is valuable if you do four things with it: recognize it, admit it, learn from it, forget it"
4820,Stay the course. When thwarted try again; harder; smarter. Persevere relentlessly.

4822,Do not let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.
4823,"Champions never complain, they are too busy getting better"
4824,"When you improve a little each day, eventually big things occur. When you improve conditioning a little each day, eventually you have a big improvement in conditioning. Not tomorrow, not the next day, but eventually a big gain is made. Don't look for the big, quick improvement. Seek the small improvement one day at a time. That's the only way it happens - and when it happens, it lasts."
4825,"If we fail to adapt, we fail to move forward."

4832,"If you do enough small things right, big things can happen"
4833,I am not as good as I ought to be. I am not as good as I want to be. I am not as good as I'm going to be. But I am thankful that I am better than I used to be.
4834,What is right is more important than who is right.
4835,"If you spend too much time learning the 'tricks' of the trade, you may not learn the trade. There are no shortcuts.

5074,"Jock Semple and I were at daggers drawn for five years, even though I kind of forgave him from the get-go. I knew he was an over-stressed race director, I knew he was protecting his race.

5075,"When I forgave Jock Semple on Heartbreak Hill, I also got really cross with women. I couldn't understand why they didn't get it, why they didn't know that running was so cool and why they weren't in the race as well. Then I thought to myself ""How stupid can you be?

5315,"Do the things you used to talk about doing but never did. Know when to let go and when to hold on tight. Stop rushing. Don't be intimidated to say it like it is. Stop apologizing all the time. Learn to say no, so your yes has some oomph. Spend time with the friends who lift you up, and cut loose the ones who bring you down. Stop giving your power away. Be more concerned with being interested than being interesting. Be old enough to appreciate your freedom, and young enough to enjoy it. Finally know who you are."

5319,"I want to get more comfortable being uncomfortable. I want to get more confident being uncertain. I don't want to shrink back just because something isn't easy. I want to push back, and make more room in the area between I can't and I can."

5322,"I love the big fresh starts, the clean slates like birthdays and new years, but I also really like the idea that we can get up every morning and start over."
5323,"As I get older I see that running has changed for me. What used to be about burning calories is now more about burning up what is false. Lies I used to tell myself about who I was and what I could do, friendships that cannot withstand hills or miles, the approval I no longer need to seek, and solidarity that cannot bear silence. I run to burn up what I don't need and ignite what I do."
5324,"It's not only moving that creates new starting points. Sometimes all it takes is a subtle shift in perspective, an opening of the mind, an intentional pause and reset, or a new route to start to see new options and new possibilities."
5325,"Running has taken me in, and continues to comfort, heal and challenge me in all kinds of magical ways. I am not a 'good runner' because I am me. I am a good 'me' because I am a runner."

5328,"Without running, I would have missed the joy of rain. What could be considered an inconvenience or a bummer to the inexperienced is actually a gift. Without running, I would miss a lot of things-like seeing cities in a certain way, or knowing certain people all the way to the core. I'm glad we don't experience life through glass, under cover, or from the sidelines. Good things take miles."

5332,Embrace your sweat. It is your essence and your emancipation.

5334,"I find significance in all kinds of small details when I run; I'm hyper aware of my surroundings, the sensations in my body, and the thoughts running through my mind. Everything is clearer, heightened. I might be more addicted to this clarity than I am to running itself."
5335,"Every mile marker can be met with some measure of trepidation, in a race or in life. Am I on target? Do I have what it takes to finish strong? Am I taking care to stay nourished so I can endure? Is my training proving to be sufficient? Am I prepared for the hills? It is impossible to fathom the full distance, so we make our way to the next mile marker, and the next, checking in with ourselves as we go."
5336,"In the midst of regular life, running is the touchstone that breathes adventure into my soul."
5337,"Running fills a need so we make fewer demands on others. Running reveals the roots of negative thinking, so the weeds can be pulled. Running reconnects the soul to the source, inspiring hope and creativity."
5338,"We postpone the finality of heartbreak by clinging to hope. Though this might be acceptable during early or transitional stages of grief, ultimately it is no way to live. We need both hands free to embrace life and accept love, and that's impossible if one hand has a death grip on the past."
5339,"The time I spend in the morning - praying, sipping coffee, and coming up with my list - is a ritual I relish. I have done it for so long now that I subconsciously measure whether or not the things I'm doing match with what I should be doing, what I want to be doing, and the life I want to live."

5343,"You do learn things and one of them is that happiness has nothing to do with validation from other people, the important thing is being happy with yourself ... finding something that is important to you and sticking with it no matter what anyone says. The truth is you've got to really be tough because there are all kinds of forces that are always trying to get you to do things their way ... trying to tell you that you are throwing your life away if you don't follow their advice."

5366,Sometimes I wonder if he wasn't born dead. I never met a man who was less interested in the living. Sometimes I think that's the trouble with the world: too many people in high places who are stone-cold dead.
5367,"Much of the blame is the malarkey that artists have created to glorify war, which as we all know, is nonsense, and a good deal worse than that — romantic pictures of battle, and of the dead and men in uniform and all that. And I did not want to have that story told again."
5368,"Be soft. Do not let the world make you hard. Do not let the pain make you hate. Do not let the bitterness steal your sweetness. Take pride that even though the rest of the world may disagree, you still believe it to be a beautiful place."

5372,
5373,We are here on Earth to fart around. Don't let anybody tell you any different.
5374,"For some reason, the most vocal Christians among us never mention the Beatitudes (Matthew 5). But, often with tears in their eyes, they demand that the Ten Commandments be posted in public buildings. And of course, that's Moses, not Jesus. I haven't heard one of them demand that the Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes, be posted anywhere. ""Blessed are the merciful"" in a courtroom? ""Blessed are the peacemakers"" in the Pentagon? Give me a break!"

5376,"And a step backward, after making a wrong turn, is a step in the right direction."
5377,Laughing is good exercise. It's like jogging on the inside.
5378,"How on earth can religious people believe in so much arbitrary, clearly invented balderdash?....The acceptance of a creed, any creed, entitles the acceptor to membership in the sort of artificial extended family we call a congregation. It is a way to fight loneliness. Any time I see a person fleeing from reason and into religion, I think to myself, There goes a person who simply cannot stand being so goddamned lonely anymore."
5379,Unannounced changes in life's itinerary are like dancing lessons from God.

5779,"A man who correctly guesses a woman`s age may be smart, but he's not very bright."
5780,Now get the hell out of here and go change the world.
5781,"I cured myself of shyness when it finally occurred to me that people didn't think about me half as much as I gave them credit for. The truth was, nobody gave a damn. Like most teenagers, I was far too self-centered. When I stopped being prisoner to what I worried was others’ opinions of me, I became more confident and free."
5782,"In life, all good things come hard, but wisdom is the hardest to come by."

5797,
5798,"The most important thing to remember is that inflation is not an act of God, that inflation is not a catastrophe of the elements or a disease that comes like the plague. Inflation is a policy."
5799,"The champions of socialism call themselves progressives, but they recommend a system which is characterized by rigid observance of routine and by a resistance to every kind of improvement. They call themselves liberals, but they are intent upon abolishing liberty. They call themselves democrats, but they yearn for dictatorship. They call themselves revolutionaries, but they want to make the government omnipotent. They promise the blessings of the Garden of Eden, but they plan to transform the world into a gigantic post office. Every man but one a subordinate clerk in a bureau."
5800,The advocates of public control cannot do without inflation. They need it in order to finance their policy of reckless spending and of lavishly subsidizing and bribing the voters.
5801,"The worship of the state is the worship of force. There is no more dangerous menace to civilization than a government of incompetent, corrupt, or vile men. The worst evils which mankind ever had to endure were inflicted by governments."
5802,"There is no means of avoiding the final collapse of a boom brought about by credit expansion. The alternative is only whether the crisis should come sooner as the result of voluntary abandonment of further credit expansion, or later as a final and total catastrophe of the currency system involved."
5803,Every socialist is a disguised dictator.
5804,Innovators and creative geniuses cannot be reared in schools. They are precisely the men who defy what the school has taught them.
5805,"The gold standard did not collapse. Governments abolished it in order to pave the way for inflation. The whole grim apparatus of oppression and coercion, policemen, customs guards, penal courts, prisons, in some countries even executioners, had to be put into action in order to destroy the gold standard."
5806,Inflation is the fiscal complement of statism and arbitrary government. It is a cog in the complex of policies and institutions which gradually lead toward totalitarianism .
5807,Historical knowledge is indispensable for those who want to build a better world
5808,"Socialism is not in the least what it pretends to be. It is not the pioneer of a better and finer world, but the spoiler of what thousands of years of civilization have created. It does not build, it destroys. For destruction is the essence of it. It produces nothing, it only consumes what the social order based on private ownership in the means of production has created."
5809,"The Marxians love of democratic institutions was a stratagem only, a pious fraud for the deception of the masses. Within a socialist community there is no room left for freedom."
5810,"Government is the only institution that can take a valuable commodity like paper, and make it worthless by applying ink."
5811,The struggle for freedom is ultimately not resistance to autocrats or oligarchs but resistance to the despotism of public opinion.
5812,"The main propoganda trick of supporters of the allegedly ""progressive"" policy of government control is to blame capitalism for all that is unsatisfactory in present-day conditions and to extol the blessings of socialism.  They have never attempted to prove their fallacious dogmas, all they did was to call their adversaries names and cast suspicion upon their motives.  And, unfortunately, the average citizen cannot see through these stratagems.  The liars must be afraid of the truth and are therefore driven to suppress its pronouncement."
5813,Depressions and mass unemployment are not caused by the free market but by government interference in the economy.
5814,
5815,[E]conomic history is a long record of government policies that failed because they were designed with a bold disregard for the laws of economics
5816,"If one rejects laissez faire on account of mans fallibility and moral weakness, one must for the same reason also reject every kind of government action."
5817,Liberty is always freedom from the government.
5818,He who is unfit to serve his fellow citizens wants to rule them.
5819,"It is important to remember that government interference always means either violent action or the threat of such action. Government is in the last resort the employment of armed men, of policemen, gendarmes, soldiers, prison guards, and hangmen. The essential feature of government is the enforcement of its decrees by beating, killing, and imprisoning. Those who are asking for more government interference are asking ultimately for more compulsion and less freedom."
5820,"Every government intervention [in the marketplace] creates unintended consequences, which lead to calls for further government interventions."
5821,"Economic progress is the work of the savers, who accumulate capital, and of the entrepreneurs, who turn capital to new uses."

5826,"So easy it is to see the errors of past ages, so difficult to acknowledge our own!"
5827,The boughs of no two trees ever have the same arrangement. Nature always produces individuals; She never produces classes.
5828,You find yourself refreshed in the presence of cheerful people. Why not make an honest effort to confer that pleasure on others? Half the battle is gained if you never allow yourself to say anything gloomy.
5829,"Every human being has, like Socrates, an attendant spirit; and wise are they who obey its signals. If it does not always tell us what to do, it always cautions us what not to do."
5830,"It is my  mission to help in the breaking down of classes, and to make all  men feel as if they were brethren of the same family, sharing the same rights, the same capabilities, and the same responsibilities. While my hand can hold a pen, I will use it to this end; and while my brain can earn a dollar, I will devote it to this end."
5831,"a great mind can attend to little things, but a little mind cannot attend to great things."
5832,"Love is the divine quality that everywhere produces and restores life. To each and every one of us, it gives the power of working miracles if we will."

5836,The rarest attainment is to grow old happily and gracefully.
5837,It is impossible to exaggerate the evil work theology has done in the world.
5838,"To everything there is a bright side and a dark side; and I hold it to be unwise, unphilosophic, unkind to others, and unhealthy for one's own soul, to form the habit of looking on the dark side. Cheerfulness is to the spiritual atmosphere what sunshine is to the earthly landscape. I am resolved to cherish cheerfulness with might and main."
5839,The United States is a warning rather than an example to the world.
5840,Blessed indeed is the man who hears many gentle voices call him father.

5843,"Flowers have spoken to me more than I can tell in written words. They are the hieroglyphics of angels, loved by all men for the beauty of their character, though few can decipher even fragments of their meaning."
5844,"If we really believed that those who are gone from us were as truly alive as ourselves, we could not invest the subject with such awful depth of gloom as we do. If we could imbue our children with distinct faith in immortality, we should never speak of people as dead, but passed into another world. We should speak of the body as a cast-off garment, which the wearer had outgrown; consecrated indeed by the beloved being that used it for a season, but of no value within itself."
5845,"our republican ideas cannot be consistently carried out while women are excluded from any share in the government. ... Any class of human beings to whom a position of perpetual subordination is assigned, however much they may be petted and flattered, must inevitably be dwarfed, morally and intellectually."
5846,We must not forget that all great revolutions and reformations would look mean and meagre if examined in detail as they occurred at the time.
5847,
5848,"God is using all of your experiences, both good and bad, to develop your character to match your calling."

5851,Do not confuse the command to love with the disease to please.
5852,Life as a Christ follower will always be a learning process of depending less on our own strength and more on God's power.

5854,Big things are built one brick at a time. Victories are achieved one choice at a time. A life well lived is chosen one day at a time.
5855,"You've never gone too far that God can't redeem you, restore you, forgive you, and give you a second chance."
5856,There is power in simply speaking the name Jesus.
5857,"No matter your age, stage of life, or circumstances, don't forget to dare to dream with God. You don't have to figure anything out. Just keep saying yes to Him, in big ways and small, and watch what He does."
5858,"When God says no, we are sometimes tempted to wonder if He loves us. In reality, it’s because He loves us, He sometimes says no."
5859,"Tonight, no matter what you're going through... backtrack and remember all the places where God has been so faithful before in your life. And know. Know with assurance. And boldness. And confidence. He is the same faithful God."
5860,Not making a decision is actually a decision. It's the decision to stay the same.
5861,Just because something is hard doesn’t mean it’s impossible.
5862,This life is not about me. It's about joining hands with Jesus to fulfill whatever tasks He sets before me and to share His love with all He brings my way.
5863,Having faith doesn't mean I have all the answers. It means trusting God especially in the midst of uncertainty.
5864,A woman who is careful with her words is a gift to all who know her.
5865,"Remember, the Devil loves to make us focus on the little that's wrong so we miss the big picture of all that's right."
5866,The secret to healthy conflict resolution isn't taking a 'you against me' stance. The secret is realizing it's 'us against Satan.' He's the real enemy.
5867,"Most of us spend years chasing things in this world that we think will make us feel loved. But everything this world has to offer is temporary. Everything. The kind of love our souls crave is lasting, eternal. And only God can fill up our hearts with that kind of love."
5868,Scars are beautiful when we see them as glorious reminders that we courageously survived.
5869,God is mighty. God is caring. God is worthy of praise. God is loving. God is able. God is in control. Nothing takes God by surprise. Some sweet reminders to soak in before falling asleep tonight.
5870,God will always do great things with people who are willing to be faithful in the small things.
5871,Forgiveness is mandatory; reconciliation is optional.
5872,
5873,"Carefully watch your thoughts, for they become your words. Manage and watch your words, for they will become your actions. Consider and judge your actions, for they have become your habits. Acknowledge and watch your habits, for they shall become your values. Understand and embrace your values, for they become your destiny."
5874,
5875,Our greatest ability as humans is not to change the world; but to change ourselves.
5876,"Many people, especially ignorant people, want to punish you for speaking the truth, for being correct, for being you. Never apologize for being correct, or for being years ahead of your time. If you’re right and you know it, speak your mind. Speak your mind. Even if you are a minority of one, the truth is still the truth."
5877,
5878,All good thoughts and ideas mean nothing without action
5879,it's easy to stand in the crowd but it takes courage to stand alone

Keep your values positive because your values become your destiny.
5881,You never know where your actions will lead to. But if you don't do anything they will lead you nowhere.
5882,"Conquer the heart of the enemy with truth and love, not by violence."
5883,"If you want to change the world, start with yourself."
5884,"Vaccination is a barbarous practice and one of the most fatal of all the delusions current in our time. Conscientious objectors to vaccination should stand alone, if need be, against the whole world, in defense of their conviction."

5886,"In doing something, do it with love or never do it at all."
5887,To lose patience is to lose the battle.
5888,A customer is the most important visitor on our premises. He is not dependent on us. We are dependent on him. He is not an interruption in our work. He is the purpose of it. He is not an outsider in our business. He is part of it. We are not doing him a favor by serving him. He is doing us a favor by giving us an opportunity to do so.
5889,"When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won. There have been tyrants and murderers and for a time they seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall... think of it, always."
5890,The golden rule is to act fearlessly upon what one believes to be right.
5891,"Begin your day with prayer, and make it so soulful that it may remain with you until the evening."

5896,Peace is the most powerful weapon of mankind.
5897,
5898,
5899,"The media's the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent, and that's power. Because they control the minds of the masses."
5900,"One of the first things I think young people, especially nowadays, should learn is how to see for yourself and listen for yourself and think for yourself. Then you can come to an intelligent decision for yourself. If you form the habit of going by what you hear others say about someone, or going by what others think about someone, instead of searching that thing out for yourself and seeing for yourself, you will be walking west when you think you're going east, and you will be walking east when you think you're going west."

5905,"If you stick a knife nine inches into my back and pull it out three inches, that is not progress. Even if you pull it all the way out, that is not progress. Progress is healing the wound, and America hasn't even begun to pull out the knife."
5906,"When the people who are in power want to use again, create an image, to justify something that's bad, they use the press. And they'll use the press to create a humanitarian image, for a devil, or a devil image for a humanitarian. They'll take a person who's a victim of the crime, and make it appear he's the criminal, and they'll take the criminal and make it appear that he's the victim of the crime."

5912,"I have more respect for a man who lets me know where he stands, even if he's wrong, than the one who comes up like an angel and is nothing but a devil."
5913,"When you live in a poor neighborhood, you are living in an area where you have poor schools. When you have poor schools, you have poor teachers. When you have poor teachers, you get a poor education. When you get a poor education, you can only work in a poor-paying job. And that poor-paying job enables you to live again in a poor neighborhood. So, it's a very vicious cycle."
5914,"We won't organize any black man to be a Democrat or a Republican because both of them have sold us out. Both of them have sold us out; both parties have sold us out. Both parties are racist, and the Democratic Party is more racist than the Republican Party."
5915,"Learn to see, listen, and think for yourself."
5916,"When you hear me say ""by any means necessary,"" I mean exactly that. I believe in anything that is necessary to correct unjust conditions-political, economic, social, physical, anything that is necessary."
5917,Only a fool would let his enemy teach his children.
5918,You can't separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom.
5919,"You're living at a time of extremism, a time of revolution 
 A time where there's got to be a change. People in power have misused it 
 And now there has to be a change and a better world has to be built 
 And the only way is going to be built is with extreme methods 
 And I for one will join with anyone, don't care what color you are 
 As long as you want change this miserable condition that exists on this earth"
5920,"Education is an important element in the struggle for human rights. It is the means to help our children and thereby increase self-respect. Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today."

5929,"If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment."
5930,"Think of all the years passed by in which you said to yourself ""I'll do it tomorrow,"" and how the gods have again and again granted you periods of grace of which you have not availed yourself. It is time to realize that you are a member of the Universe, that you are born of Nature itself, and to know that a limit has been set to your time. Use every moment wisely, to perceive your inner refulgence, or 'twill be gone and nevermore within your reach."
5931,
5932,Do not be wise in words - be wise in deeds.
5933,"Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones."
5934,You always own the option of having no opinion. There is never any need to get worked up or to trouble your soul about things you can't control. These things are not asking to be judged by you. Leave them alone.

5950,"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our Light, not our Darkness, that most frightens us."
5951,Your personal power is not something that is going to reveal itself at some later date. Your power is a result of your decision to reveal it. You are powerful in whatever moment you choose to be.

 it's time to simply be with the question."
5953,"You don't need a new life, just a new lens through which to view the one you have."

5955,"We are not here to fix, change or belittle another person. We are here to support, forgive and heal one another."
5956,Love is what we are born with. Fear is what we learn. The spiritual journey is the unlearning of fear and prejudices and the acceptance of love back in our hearts. Love is the essential reality and our purpose on earth.

As soon as your gifts are dedicated to His work, they will blossom. Chains that might have held you back for years will dissolve. And you will feel free. You will learn that your spirit is bigger than your circumstances, as soon as you put your spirit first."
5960,"Every bird that sings, sings for you. Every breeze that blows, blows for you. Every sunray shines for you. If you only knew how loved you are."
5961,"In every moment we make a decision -- whether conscious or unconscious. Will I choose to open my heart, send love, withhold judgment and thus free myself from fear? Or will I close my heart, project fear instead of extending love, judge others, and thus bind myself to fear? The choice is mine and mine alone."
5962,"Happiness is the choice I make today. It does not rest on my circumstances, but on my frame of mind...In cultivating the habits of happiness, I attract the people and situations that match its frequency. I smile more often, give praise more often, give thanks more often, and am glad more often. For such is my choice today."
5963,"To the ego mind, surrender means giving up. To the spiritual mind, surrender means giving in and receiving."
5964,We don't reach the light through endless analysis of the dark. We reach the light by choosing the light.
5965,"The choice to follow love through to its completion is the choice to seek completion within ourselves. The point at which we shut down on others is the point at which we shut down on life. We heal as we heal others, and we heal others by extending our perceptions past their weaknesses. Until we have seen someone’s darkness, we don’t really know who that person is. Until we have forgiven someone’s darkness, we don’t really know what love is. Forgiving others is the only way to forgive ourselves, and forgiveness is our greatest need."
5966,"The more room you give yourself to express your true thoughts and feelings, the more room there is for your wisdom to emerge."
5967,"Once you know that every moment and every person and every situation has something to teach you, you're a student all day. You know it's the depth of your observation that is the issue - not how much the world has to show you."

5981,"A wise girl knows her limits, a smart girl knows that she has none."
5982,Everyone's a star and deserves the right to twinkle.
5983,"A woman is often measured by the things she cannot control. She is measured by the way her body curves or doesn't curve, by where she is flat or straight or round. She is measured by 36-24-36 and inches and ages and numbers, by all the outside things that don’t ever add up to who she is on the inside. And so if a woman is to be measured, let her be measured by the things she can control, by who she is and who she is trying to become. Because as every woman knows, measurements are only statistics... and STATISTICS LIE."
5984,
5985,"Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about."

6227,We've got a responsibility to live up to the legacy of those who came before us by doing all that we can to help those who come after us.
6228,"You have to practice success. Success doesn't just show up. If you aren't practicing success today, you won't wake up in 20 years and be successful, because you won't have developed the habits of success, which are small things like finishing what you start, putting a lot of effort into everything you do, being on time, treating people well."
6229,
6230,"Every girl, no matter where she lives, deserves the opportunity to develop the promise inside of her."
6231,"Do not bring people in your life who weigh you down. And trust your instincts ... good relationships feel good. They feel right. They don't hurt. They're not painful. That's not just with somebody you want to marry, but it's with the friends that you choose. It's with the people you surround yourselves with."
6232,
6233,"When you've worked hard, and done well, and walked through that doorway of opportunity...you do not slam it shut behind you...you reach back, and you give other folks the same chances that helped you succeed."
6234,Value everyone's contribution and treat everyone with respect.
6235,Women and girls can do whatever they want. There is no limit to what we as women can accomplish.
6236,"When women and girls rise, 
 their communities 
 and their countries rise with them"
6237,You may not always have a comfortable life and you will not always be able to solve all of the world's problems at once but don't ever underestimate the importance you can have because history has shown us that courage can be contagious and hope can take on a life of its own.
6238,I admit it: I am louder than the average human being and have no fear of speaking my mind. These traits don't come from the color of my skin but from an unwavering belief in my own intelligence.
6239,"Do not die in the history of your past hurts and past experiences, but live in the now and future of your destiny."
6240,"Walk away from 'friendships' that make you feel small and insecure, and seek out people who inspire you and support you"
6241,There is nothing more important to this nation's future than investing in our young people.
6242,We have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be.
6243,We need to do a better job of putting ourselves higher on our own 'to do' list.
6244,I was too worried about the grades and I should have been more worried about learning.
6245,"Don't let anyone speak for you, and don't rely on others to fight for you."
6246,Be passionate about something and lean to that strength.
6247,
6248,"When a man spends his own money to buy something for himself, he is very careful about how much he spends and how he spends it. When a man spends his own money to buy something for someone else, he is still very careful about how much he spends, but somewhat less what he spends it on. When a man spends someone else's money to buy something for himself, he is very careful about what he buys, but doesn't care at all how much he spends. And when a man spends someone else's money on someone else, he does't care how much he spends or what he spends it on. And that's government for you."
6249,
6250,One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results.
6251,
6252,"Government has three primary functions. It should provide for military defense of the nation. It should enforce contracts between individuals. It should protect citizens from crimes against themselves or their property. When government-- in pursuit of good intentions tries to rearrange the economy, legislate morality, or help special interests, the cost come in inefficiency, lack of motivation, and loss of freedom. Government should be a referee, not an active player."
6253,"If you pay people not to work and tax them when they do, don't be surprised if you get unemployment."
6254,Inflation is the one form of taxation that can be imposed without legislation.
6255,The only corporate social responsibility a company has is to maximize its profits.
6256,
6257,"Why have we had such a decline in moral climate? I submit to you that a major factor has been a change in the philosophy which has been dominant, a change from belief in individual responsibility to belief in social responsibility. If you adopt the view that a man is not responsible for his own behavior, that somehow society is responsible, why should he seek to make his behavior good?"
6258,You cannot be sure that you are right unless you understand the arguments against your views better than your opponents do.
6259,"When you start paying people to be poor, you wind up with an awful lot of poor people."
6260,Many people want the government to protect the consumer. A much more urgent problem is to protect the consumer from the government.
6261,"A society that puts equality — in the sense of equality of outcome — ahead of freedom will end up with neither equality nor freedom. The use of force to achieve equality will destroy freedom, and the force, introduced for good purposes, will end up in the hands of people who use it to promote their own interests."
6262,"Because we live in a largely free society, we tend to forget how limited is the span of time and the part of the globe for which there has ever been anything like political freedom: the typical state of mankind is tyranny, servitude, and misery."
6263,"The word 'free' is used three times in the Declaration of Independence and once in the First Amendment to the Constitution, along with 'freedom.' The word 'fair' is not used in either of our founding documents."
6264,The Federal Reserve the privately owned U.S. central bank definitely caused The Great Depression by contracting the amount of currency in circulation by one third from 1929 to 1933.
6265,The great virtue of a free market system is that it does not care what color people are; it does not care what their religion is; it only cares whether they can produce something you want to buy. It is the most effective system we have discovered to enable people who hate one another to deal with one another and help one another.
6266,Nobody spends somebody else's money as carefully as he spends his own.
6267,The power to do good is also the power to do harm.
6268,The most important single central fact about a free market is that no exchange takes place unless both parties benefit.
6269,"Every economist knows that minimum wages either do nothing or cause inflation and unemployment. That's not a statement, it's a definition."
6270,You cannot simultaneously have free immigration and a welfare state.
6271,Higher taxes never reduce the deficit. Governments spend whatever they take in and then whatever they can get away with.
6272,
6273,"The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning."
6274,Nothing haunts us like the things we don't say.
6275,What you have done to this point cannot be undone. What you do next... It is still unwritten.
6276,"When someone is in your heart, they're never truly gone. They can come back to you, even at unlikely times."
6277,Accept who you are; and revel in it.
6278,All endings are also beginnings. We just don't know it at the time.
6279,There are two stories for every life; the one you live & the one others tell
6280,"Parents rarely let go of their children, so children let go of them. They move on. They move away. The moments that used to define them - a mother's approval, a father's nod - are covered by moments of their own accomplishments. It is not until much later, as the skin sags and the heart weakens, that children understand; their stories, and all their accomplishments, sit atop the stories of their mothers and fathers, stones upon stones, beneath the waters of their lives."
6281,"This is part of what a family is about, not just love. It's knowing that your family will be there watching out for you. Nothing else will give you that. Not money. Not fame. Not work."
6282,We need to forgive ourselves. For all the things we didn't do. All the things we should have done. You can't get stuck on the regrets of what should have happened.
6283,There is no such thing as 'too late' in life.
6284,"Lost love is still love. It takes a different form, that's all. You can't see their smile or bring them food or tousle their hair or move them around a dance floor. But when those senses weaken another heightens. Memory. Memory becomes your partner. You nurture it. You hold it. You dance with it."
6285,Mankind is connected in ways it does not understand - even in dreams.
6286,You can find something truly important in an ordinary minute.
6287,"Fear is how you lose your life...a little bit at a time...What we give to fear, we take away from...faith."
6288,"But there's a story behind everything. How a picture got on a wall. How a scar got on your face. Sometimes the stories are simple, and sometimes they are hard and heartbreaking. But behind all your stories is always your mother's story, because hers is where yours begin."
6289,"Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself."
6290,"...if you're trying to show off for people at the top, forget it. They will look down on you anyhow. And if you're trying to show off for people at the bottom, forget it. They will only envy you. Status will get you nowhere. Only an open heart will allow you to float equally between everyone."
6291,"Accept what you are able to do and what you are not able to do. Accept the past as past, without denying it or discarding it. Learn to forgive yourself and to forgive others. Don't assume that it's too late to get involved."
6292,Don't cling to things because everything is impermanent.
6293,The secret to happiness...be satisfied and be grateful.
6294,"Life is a series of pulls back and forth. You want to do one thing, but you are bound to do something else."
6295,"Each affects the other, and the other affects the next, and the world is full of stories, but the stories are all one."
6296,"When you look into your mother’s eyes, you know that is the purest love you can find on this earth."
6297,"If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives: Be kind anyway. If you are successful you will win some false friends and true enemies: Succeed anyway. If you are honest and frank people will try to cheat you: Be honest anyway. What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight: Build anyway. If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous of you: Be happy anyway. The good you do today, will often be forgotten by tomorrow: Do good anyway. Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough: Give your best anyway."
6298,
6299,Small things done with great love will change the world.
6300,
6301,"The good you do today may be forgotten tomorrow. Do good anyway. Give the world the best you have and it may never be enough. Give your best anyway. For you see, in the end, it is between you and God. It was never between you and them anyway."
6302,"Life is an opportunity, benefit from it. Life is beauty, admire it. Life is a dream, realize it. Life is a challenge, meet it. Life is a duty, complete it. Life is a game, play it. Life is a promise, fulfill it. Life is sorrow, overcome it. Life is a song, sing it. Life is a struggle, accept it. Life is a tragedy, confront it. Life is an adventure, dare it. Life is luck, make it. Life is too precious, do not destroy it. Life is life, fight for it."
6303,"I can do things you cannot, you can do things I cannot; together we can do great things."
6304,"I used to believe that prayer changes things, but now I know that prayer changes us, and we change things."
6305,
6306,"At the end of life we will not be judged by how many diplomas we have received, how much money we have made, how many great things we have done. We will be judged by ""I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat, I was naked and you clothed me. I was homeless, and you took me in."
6307,
6308,"If you want to change the world, go home and love your family."
6309,
6310,"Prayer is not asking. Prayer is putting oneself in the hands of God, at His disposition, and listening to His voice in the depth of our hearts."
6311,Go out into the world today and love the people you meet. Let your presence light new light in the hearts of people.
6312,I don't do great things. I do small things with great love.
6313,"Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless."
6314,There is no key to happiness; the door is always open
6315,What we sometimes consider a stumbling block is rather a rock we can step on.
6316,Helping hands are better than Praying Lips
6317,"God didn't call me to be successful, He called me to be faithful."

6320,"If you judge people, you have no time to love them."
6321,"I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples."
6322,
6323,"It is better to sit alone than in company with the bad, and it is better still to sit with the good than alone. It is better to speak to a seeker of knowledge than to remain silent, but silence is better than idle words."
6324,"Conduct yourself in this world as if you are here to stay forever, and yet prepare for eternity as if you are to die tomorrow."
6325,Even a smile can be charity.
6326,Say the truth even if it may be bitter.
6327,The greatest of wealth is the richness of the soul.
6328,Wisdom and power follow endurance and patience.
6329,Happy are those who find fault with themselves instead of finding fault with others.
6330,You will not enter paradise until you have faith. And you will not complete your faith until you love one another.
6331,"Do not tell me how educated you are. Tell me how much you have traveled, and I will know how educated you are."
6332,The best jihad is to speak a word of justice to an oppressive ruler.
6333,Patience is the key to content.
6334,"If you do not feel ashamed of anything, then you can do whatever you like"
6335,
6336,Strive always to excel in virtue and truth.
6337,More harm is done by fools through foolishness than is done by evil-doers through wickedness.
6338,"When something weighs on your conscience, give it up."
6339,Do you love your creator Love your fellow-beings first.
6340,Contemplation for an hour is better than formal worship for sixty years.
6341,"Riches does not mean, having a great amount of property, but riches is self-contentment."
6342,"Religion is very easy and whoever overburdens himself in his religion will not be able to continue in that way. So you should not be extremists, but try to be near to perfection and receive the good tidings that you will be rewarded; and gain strength by worshipping in the mornings, the nights."
6343,Love for one's country is part of faith.
6344,"If anyone travels on a road in search of knowledge, Allah will cause him to travel on one of the roads of Paradise."
6345,"Do not think little of any good deed, even if it is just greeting your brother with a smile."
6346,"Speak to people according to the development of their consciousness, for if you speak all things to all people, some cannot understand you and so fall into errors!"
6347,
6348,"I'll tell you how I'd like to be remembered: As a black man who won the heavyweight title - Who has humorous and who never looked down on those who looked up to him - A man who stood for freedom, justice and equality - And I wouldn't even mind if folks forgot how pretty I was."
6349,Even the greatest was once a beginner. Don't be afraid to take that first step.
6350,
6351,Success is not achieved by winning all the time. Real success comes when we rise after we fall. Some mountains are higher than others. Some roads steeper than the next. There are hardships and setbacks but you cannot let them stop you. Even on the steepest road you must not turn back.
6352,"We all have the same God, we just serve him differently. Rivers, lakes, ponds, streams, oceans all have different names, but they all contain water. So do religions have different names, and they all contain truth, expressed in different ways forms and times. It doesn't matter whether you're a Muslim, a Christian, or a Jew. When you believe in God, you should believe that all people are part of one family. If you love God, you can't love only some of his children."
6353,
6354,
6355,True success is reaching our potential without compromising our values.
6356,
6357,Impossible is not a fact. It's an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It's a dare. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing
6358,Just remember that you don't have to be what they want you to be.
6359,"Rest but never quit. Even the sun has a sinking spell each evening. But it always rises the next morning. At sunrise, every soul is born again."
6360,"If you look at the world the same way when you're 50 that you did when you were 20, then you wasted 30 years."
6361,
6362,"When you're right, nobody remembers. When you're wrong, nobody forgets."
6363,We can't be brave without fear.
6364,Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth.
6365,"I am grateful for all my victories, but I am especially grateful for my losses, because they only made me work harder."
6366,Success is not achieved by winning all the time. Real success comes when we rise after we fall.
6367,"Every day is different, and some days are better than others, but no matter how challenging the day, I get up and live it."
6368,What counts in the ring is what you can do after you're exhausted. The same is true of life.
6369,"You're not going to enjoy every minute of the journey, but the success you'll find at the end will make it all worth it."
6370,"If we continue to think and live as if we belong only to different cultures and different religions, with separate missions and goals, we will always be in self-defeating competition with each other. Once we realize we are all members of humanity, we will want to compete in the spirit of love."
6371,There comes a time in every person's life when he has to choose the course his life will take.
6372,
6373,"Jesus doesn't give an explanation for the pain and sorrow of the world. He comes where the pain is most acute and takes it upon himself. Jesus doesn't explain why there is suffering, illness, and death in the world. He brings healing and hope. He doesn't allow the problem of evil to be the subject of a seminar. He allows evil to do its worst to him. He exhausts it, drains its power, and emerges with new life."
6374,Our culture is so fixated on dying and going to heaven when the whole Scripture is about heaven coming to earth.
6375,"Our task as image-bearing, God-loving, Christ-shaped, Spirit-filled Christians, following Christ and shaping our world, is to announce redemption to a world that has discovered its fallenness, to announce healing to a world that has discovered its brokenness, to proclaim love and trust to a world that knows only exploitation, fear and suspicion."
6376,It's not great faith you need; it is faith in a great God.
6377,"Jesus's resurrection is the beginning of God's new project not to snatch people away from earth to heaven but to colonize earth with the life of heaven. That, after all, is what the Lord's Prayer is about."
6378,People often get upset when you teach them what is in the Bible rather than what they presume is in the Bible.
6379,Worship is love on its knees before the beloved; just as mission is love on its feet to serve the beloved
6380,"You become like what you worship. When you gaze in awe, admiration, and wonder at something or someone, you begin to take on something of the character of the object of your worship."
6381,"What you do in the present—by painting, preaching, singing, sewing, praying, teaching, building hospitals, digging wells, campaigning for justice, writing poems, caring for the needy, loving your neighbor as yourself—will last into God’s future. These activities are not simply ways of making the present life a little less beastly, a little more bearable, until the day when we leave it behind altogether. They are part of what we may call building for God’s kingdom."
6382,"Tolerance is a cheap, low-grade parody of love. Tolerance is not a great virtue to aspire to. Love is much tougher and harder."
6383,"The cross is the surest, truest and deepest window on the very heart and character of the living and loving God."
6384,"The church exists primarily for two closely correlated purposes: to worship God and to work for his kingdom in the world ... The church also exists for a third purpose, which serves the other two: to encourage one another, to build one another up in faith, to pray with and for one another, to learn from one another and teach one another, and to set one another examples to follow, challenges to take up, and urgent tasks to perform. This is all part of what is known loosely as fellowship."
6385,"Made for spirituality, we wallow in introspection. Made for joy, we settle for pleasure. Made for justice, we clamor for vengeance. Made for relationship, we insist on our own way. Made for beauty, we are satisfied with sentiment. But new creation has already begun. The sun has begun to rise. Christians are called to leave behind, in the tomb of Jesus Christ, all that belongs to the brokenness and incompleteness of the present world ... That, quite simply, is what it means to be Christian: to follow Jesus Christ into the new world, God's new world, which he has thrown open before us."
6386,"Wherever St. Paul went, there was a riot. Wherever I go, they serve tea."
6387,"If you have never felt or known the sheer power and strength of God's love, take another look at Jesus dying on the cross."
6388,"Love is not just tolerance. It's not just distant appreciation. It's a warm sense of, 'I am enjoying the fact that you are you.'"
6389,"True worship is open to God, adoring God, waiting for God, trusting God even in the dark."
6390,"The closer you get to the truth, the clearer becomes the beauty, and the more you will find worship welling up within you. That's why theology and worship belong together."
6391,"The whole point of the kingdom of God is Jesus has come to bear witness to the true truth, which is nonviolent. When God wants to take charge of the world, he doesn't send in the tanks. He sends in the poor and the meek."
6392,The message of Easter is that God's new world has been unveiled in Jesus Christ and that you're now invited to belong to it.
6393,"God's plan is not to abandon this world, the world which he said was ""very good."" Rather, he intends to remake it. And when he does he will raise all his people to new bodily life to live in it. That is the promise of the Christian gospel."
6394,"True worship doesn't put on a show or make a fuss; true worship isn't forced, isn't half-hearted, doesn't keep looking at its watch, doesn't worry what the person in the next pew is doing. True worship is open to God, adoring God, waiting for God, trusting God even in the dark."
6395,"Hope, for the Christian, is not wishful thinking or mere blind optimism. It is a mode of knowing, a mode within which new things are possible, options are not shut down, new creation can happen."
6396,"The cross is the place where, and the means by which, God loved us to the uttermost."
6397,
6398,Victory is not always winning the battle...but rising every time you fall.
6399,Un croquis vaut mieux qu
6400,The reason most people fail instead of succeed is they trade what they want most for what they want at the moment.
6401,It is not necessary to bury the truth. It is sufficient merely to delay it until nobody cares.
6402,Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.
6403,"The World is not ruined by the wickedness of the wicked, but by the weakness of the good."
6404,You don't reason with intellectuals. You shoot them.
6405,Courage isn't having the strength to go on - it is going on when you don't have strength.
6406,
6407,"Until you spread your wings, you'll have no idea how far you can fly."
6408,The only way to lead people is to show them a future: a leader is a dealer in hope.
6409,The best way to make every one poor is to insist on equality of wealth.
6410,God is on the side with the best artillery
6411,Impossible is the word found only in a fool's dictionary. Wise people create opportunities for themselves and make everything possible.
6412,The purpose of religion is to keep the poor from killing the rich.
6413,"Once you have made up your mind, stick to it; there is no longer any 'if' or 'but'."
6414,The surest way to remain poor is to be an honest man.
6415,Envy is a declaration of inferiority.
6416,"Strategy is the art of making use of time and space. I am less concerned about the later than the former. Space we can recover, lost time never."
6417,"Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne, and I have founded empires. But on what did we rest the creations of our genius? Upon force. Jesus Christ founded his empire upon love; and at this hour millions of men would die for him."
6418,"There is only one thing in this world, and that is to keep acquiring money and more money, power and more power. All the rest is meaningless."
6419,You become strong by defying defeat and by turning loss into gain and failure to success.
6420,"Six hours' sleep for a man, seven for a woman, and eight for a fool."
6421,"Impatience is a great obstacle to success; he who treats everything with brusqueness gathers nothing, or only immature fruit which will never ripen."
6422,
6423,"Discipline comes through self control. This means that you must control all negative qualities. Before you can control conditions, you must first control yourself. Self-mastery is the hardest job you will ever tackle. If you do not conquer self, you will be conquered by self."
6424,"Time is wealth, and unlike money when it is gone you cannot replace it."
6425,Failure cannot cope with persistence.
6426,"Truly, “thoughts are things,” and powerful things at that, when they are mixed with definiteness of purpose, persistence, and a burning desire for their translation into riches, or other material objects."
6427,"Your mental attitude gives your entire personality a drawing power that attracts the circumstances, things and people you think about most!"
6428,Behind every adversity - is an opportunity!
6429,No one ever is defeated until defeat has been accepted as a reality.
6430,"The primary reason for failure is that people do not develop new 
 plans to replace those plans that didn't work."
6431,Persistence is nothing more than Concentrated Effort mixed with Determination and Faith.
6432,
6433,"Fear is a habit, so is self pity, defeat, anxiety, despair, hopelessness and resignation. You can eliminate all of these negative habits with two simple resolves: I can and I will."
6434,"A state of mind is something that one assumes. It cannot be purchased, it must be created."
6435,
6436,"You have absolute control over just one thing, your thoughts.  This divine gift is the sole means by which you may control your destiny.  If you fail to control your mind, you will control nothing else."
6437,"Anything you do to and for another person, you do it to and for yourself"
6438,A goal is a dream with a deadline.
6439,
6440,Our only limitations are those we set up in our own minds
6441,"Cherish your visions and your dreams, as they are the children of your soul; the blueprints of your ultimate achievements."
6442,The man of decision cannot be stopped! The man of indecision cannot be started! Take your own choice.
6443,"Live each day as if it were your last, and you’ll develop a keen respect for opportunity."
6444,"The number one reason people fail in life is because they listen to their friends, family, and neighbors."
6445,A positive mind finds a way it can be done; a negative mind looks for all the ways it can't be done.
6446,"Anything acquired without effort, and without cost is generally unappreciated."
6447,
6448,"God does not begin by asking us about our ability, but only about our availability, and if we then prove our dependability, he will increase our capability."
6449,"In conclusion, the submission of one's will is really the only uniquely personal thing we have to place on God's altar. The many other things we 'give,' brothers and sisters, are actually the things He has already given or loaned to us. However, when you and I finally submit ourselves, by letting our individual wills be swallowed up in God's will, then we are really giving something to Him! It is the only possession which is truly ours to give!"
6450,"If, in the end, you have not chosen Jesus Christ it will not matter what you have chosen."
6451,"I fear that, as conditions worsen, many will react to the failures of too much government by calling for even more government. Then there will be more and more lifeboats launched because fewer and fewer citizens know how to swim. Unlike some pendulums, political pendulums to not swing back automatically; they must be pushed. History is full of instances when people have waited in vain for pendulums to swing back."
6452,"No ""natural"" resource is more precious and to be used more wisely than time.  These mortal moments matter more than we know.  There are no idle hours; there are only idle people. In true righteousness there is serenity, but there is an array of reminders that the ""sacred present"" is packed with possibilities which are slipping by us, which are going away from us each moment."
6453,"The more seriously we work on our own imperfections, the less we are judgemental of the imperfections of others."
6454,The soul is like a violin string: it makes music only when it is stretched.
6455,The acceptance of the reality that we are in the Lord's loving hands is only a recognition that we have never really been anywhere else.
6456,"Trials and tribulations tend to squeeze the artificiality out of us, leaving the essence of what we really are and clarifying what we really yearn for."
6457,"It is our job to lift others up, not to size them up."
6458,"Men's and nations' finest hour consist of those moments when extraordinary challenge is met by extraordinary response. Hence in those darkest hours, we must light our individual candles rather than vying with others to call attention to the enveloping darkness. Our indignation about injustice should lead to illumination, for if it does not, we are only adding to the despair-and the moment of gravest danger is when there is so little light that darkness seems normal!"
6459,"Patience is tied very closely to faith in our Heavenly Father. Actually, when we are unduly impatient, we are suggesting that we know what is best—better than does God. Or, at least, we are asserting that our timetable is better than His. We can grow in faith only if we are willing to wait patiently for God's purposes and patterns to unfold in our lives, on His timetable."
6460,"Time is clearly not our natural dimension. Thus it is that we are never really at home in time. Alternately, we find ourselves wishing to hasten the passage of time or to hold back the dawn. We can do neither, of course, but whereas the fish is at home in water, we are clearly not at home in time--because we belong to eternity."
6461,"During our mortal schooling in submissiveness, we will see the visible crosses that some carry, but other crosses will go unseen.  A few individuals may appear to have no trials at all, which, if it were so, would be a trial in itself.  Indeed, if, as do trees, our souls had rings to measure the years of greatest personal growth, the wide rings would likely reflect the years of greatest moisture-but from tears, not rainfall."
6462,We cannot lead or draw others to Christ unless we stand closer to Him than they do.
6463,A society which permits anything will eventually lose everything.
6464,"Long ago when a child lay in a manger, a special star appeared. It didn't just show up that evening. It had to have been placed in its orbit centuries before in a trajectory that would make it appear at that special moment of time to announce the birth of a special child. Just as there is divine design in the universe, so each of us has been placed in our own orbits in this life to love, to serve, to help light the world."
6465,"The winds of tribulation, which blow out some men's candles of commitment, only fan the fires of faith of others."
6466,"If we are serious about our discipleship, Jesus will eventually request each of us to do those very things which are most difficult for us to do."
6467,The great challenge is to refuse to let the bad things that happen to us do bad things to us. That is the crucial difference between adversity and tragedy.
6468,"God will facilitate, but He will not force."
6469,"When we are unduly impatient with an omniscient God's timing, we really are suggesting that we know what's best. Strange isn't it-we who wear wrist watches seek to counsel Him who oversees cosmic clocks and calendars."
6470,Sometimes the best people... have the worst experiences... because they are ready to learn
6471,"To be cheerful when others are in despair, to keep the faith when others falter, to be true even when we feel forsaken—all of these are deeply desired outcomes during the deliberate, divine tutorials which God gives to us—because He loves us. These learning experiences must not be misread as divine indifference. Instead, such tutorials are a part of the divine unfolding."
6472,
6473,"If you don't go within, you go without."
6474,"If you believe the noises of the world, rather than the silences of your soul, you will be lost."
6475,"Remember always, you are the gift!"
6476,"You think of yourselves as humans searching for a spiritual awakening, when in fact you are spiritual beings attempting to cope with a human awakening. Seeing yourselves from the perspective of the spirit within will help you to remember why you came here and what you came here to do."
6477,"Life is a creation, not a discovery."
6478,The way to move out of judgement is to move into gratitude
6479,"Enlightenment is understanding that there is nowhere to go, nothing to do, and nobody you have to be except exactly who you're being right now."
6480,"Good health is not the absence of symptoms, it is the presence of peace."
6481,"Obstacles are not opposing you, but merely and gently re-routing you. It is important not to view that which stands in your way as your 'enemy.' It can often be your best friend, sending you on a detour that takes you around what would have been your biggest stumbling block."
6482,"Your light is seen, your heart is known, your soul is cherished by more people than you might imagine. If you knew how many others have been touched in wonderful ways by you, you would be astonished. If you knew how many people feel so much for you, you would be shocked. You are far more wonderful than you think you are. Rest with that. Rest easy with that. Breathe again. You are doing fine. More than fine. Better than fine. You’re doin’ great. So relax. And love yourself today."
6483,Do not limit the shape and size in which your miracle can come. Sometimes the smallest keys turn the biggest locks.
6484,"So long as you are still worried about what others think of you, you are owned by them. Only when you require no approval from outside yourself can you own yourself."
6485,The universe is just a big Xerox machine. It simply produces copies of your thoughts.
6486,"Fear is energy which contracts, closes down, draws in, runs, hides, hoards, harms. Love is the energy which expands, opens up, sends out, stays, reveals, shares, HEALS."
6487,"What you resist, persists"
6488,Seek to create change in your life not because something is 'wrong' ? but because it no longer makes an accurate statement of 'who you are'.
6489,"Happiness and joy comes to you when it moves through you. There is no other pathway--and that's the miracle. You will have a number of opportunities in the days just ahead to be a vehicle of happiness and joy for another. Step right into that. Be the source of that. As you bring others to a smile, so, too, will you bring yourself. The method is foolproof."
6490,The biggest commitment you must keep is your commitment to yourself.
6491,"Healing is the process of accepting all, then choosing best."
6492,"Until you decide what something means, it has no meaning at all. You determine what something means."
6493,True vision is the ability to see in another more than they are showing you.
6494,"Nothing happens in life by accident. Nothing occurs by chance. Nothing takes place without producing the opportunity for real and lasting benefit to you. The perfection of every moment may not be apparent to you, yet that will make the moment no less perfect."
6495,There is a divine purpose behind everything - and therefore a divine presence in everything.
6496,A thing is only right or wrong because you say it is. A thing is not right or wrong intrinsically.
6497,
6498,Shoot for the stars but if you happen to miss shoot for the moon instead.
6499,It's a great thing for a man to walk on the moon. But it's a greater thing for God to walk on the earth.
6500,
6501,
6502,I believe that every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine running around doing exercises.
6503,You've got to expect things are going to go wrong. And we always need to prepare ourselves for handling the unexpected.
6504,"The single observation I would offer for your consideration is that some things are beyond your control. You can lose your health to illness or accident. You can lose your wealth to all manner of unpredictable sources. What are not easily stolen from you without your cooperation are your principles and your values. They are your most important possessions and, if carefully selected and nurtured, will well serve you and your fellow man."
6505,"Good luck, Mr. Gorsky!"
6506,Man must understand his universe in order to understand his destiny.
6507,Opportunities will be available to you that you cannot imagine.
6508,"A picture does a great job, but it's not nearly like being there."
6509,"If you don't know who you are, a university is an expensive place to find out."
6510,There are places to go beyond belief.
6511,I think we're going to the moon because it's in the nature of the human being to face challenges. It's by the nature of his deep inner soul... we're required to do these things just as salmon swim upstream.
6512,"The single thing which makes any man happiest is the realization that he has worked up to the limits of his ability, his capacity. It's all the better, of course, if this work has made a contribution to knowledge, or toward moving the human race a little farther forward."
6513,"We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11."
6514,Research is creating new knowledge.
6515,I think if there was anything I learned from our skipper was that it's not how you look; it's how you perform.
6516,"Gliders, sail planes, they're wonderful flying machines. It's the closest you can come to being a bird."
6517,I guess we all like to be recognized not for one piece of fireworks but for the ledger of our daily work.
6518,"The important achievement of Apollo was demonstrating that humanity is not forever chained to this planet, and our visions go rather further than that, and our opportunities are unlimited."
6519,"In flying, the probability of survival is inversely proportional to the angle of arrival."
6520,Geologists have a saying - rocks remember.
6521,The Eagle has landed.
6522,
6523,"May your coming year be filled with magic and dreams and good madness. I hope you read some fine books and kiss someone who thinks you're wonderful, and don't forget to make some art -- write or draw or build or sing or live as only you can. And I hope, somewhere in the next year, you surprise yourself."
6524,"Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten."
6525,"The one thing that you have that nobody else has is you. Your voice, your mind, your story, your vision. So write and draw and build and play and dance and live as only you can."
6526,"The only thing that kept me going was stories. Stories are hope. They take you out of yourself for a bit, and when you get dropped back in, you're different- you're stronger, you've seen more, you've felt more. Stories are like spiritual currency."
6527,"I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're Doing Something."
6528,
6529,"Let's start a new tomorrow, today."
6530,"Google can bring you back 100,000 answers. A librarian can bring you back the right one."
6531,"Fiction gives us empathy: it puts us inside the minds of other people, gives us the gifts of seeing the world through their eyes. Fiction is a lie that tells us true things, over and over."
6532,
6533,"Read. Read anything. Read the things they say are good for you, and the things they claim are junk. You'll find what you need to find. Just read."
6534,"There are lots of artists in the world. But there's only one you. And the only person who has your point of view is you. If you decide not to make things, all you've done is deprive the world of all the stuff that only you could have brought to it."
6535,Sometimes the best way to learn something is by doing it wrong and looking at what you did.
6536,"Well-meaning adults can easily destroy a child’s love of reading: stop them reading what they enjoy, or give them worthy-but-dull books that you like, the 21st-century equivalents of Victorian “improving” literature. You’ll wind up with a generation convinced that reading is uncool and worse, unpleasant."
6537,"Stories you read when you're the right age never quite leave you. You may forget who wrote them or what the story was called. Sometimes you'll forget precisely what happened, but if a story touches you it will stay with you, haunting the places in your mind that you rarely ever visit."
6538,The world always seems brighter when you've just made something that wasn't there before.
6539,I fell for her like a suicide from a bridge.
6540,"I hope you will have a wonderful year, that you'll dream dangerously and outrageously, that you'll make something that didn't exist before you made it, that you will be loved and that you will be liked, and that you will have people to love and to like in return. And, most importantly (because I think there should be more kindness and more wisdom in the world right now), that you will, when you need to be, be wise, and that you will always be kind."
6541,"People think dreams aren't real just because they aren't made of matter, of particles. Dreams are real. But they are made of viewpoints, of images, of memories and puns and lost hopes."
6542,It has been said that civilization is twenty-four hours and two meals away from barbarism.
6543,"I will write in words of fire. I will write them on your skin. I will write about desire. Write beginnings, write of sin. You’re the book I love the best, your skin only holds my truth, you will be a palimpsest lines of age rewriting youth. You will not burn upon the pyre. Or be buried on the shelf. You’re my letter to desire: And you’ll never read yourself. I will trace each word and comma As the final dusk descends, You’re my tale of dreams and drama, Let us find out how it ends."
6544,"Whatever it takes to finish things, finish. You will learn more from a glorious failure than you ever will from something you never finished."
6545,"People who believe they'll be happy if they go and live somewhere else, learn it doesn't work that way. Wherever you go, you take yourself with you."
6546,"She seems so cool, so focused, so quiet, yet her eyes remain fixed upon the horizon. You think you know all there is to know about her immediately upon meeting her, but everything you think you know is wrong. Passion flows through her like a river of blood. She only looked away for a moment, and the mask slipped, and you fell. All your tomorrows start here."
6547,
6548,"In the end, it's the people who are curious who change the world."
6549,The Universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.
6550,
6551,The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it.
6552,"Need a distraction today? Not only does 12 + 1 = 11 + 2, but the letters ""twelve plus one"" rearrange to give you ""eleven plus two."""
6553,"One of the biggest problems with the world today is that we have large groups of people who will accept whatever they hear on the grapevine, just because it suits their worldview—not because it is actually true or because they have evidence to support it. The really striking thing is that it would not take much effort to establish validity in most of these cases… but people prefer reassurance to research."
6554,
6555,"Claiming there is no other life in the universe is like scooping up some water, looking at the cup and claiming there are no whales in the ocean."
6556,"The problem in society is not kids not knowing science. The problem is adults not knowing science. They outnumber kids 5 to 1, they wield power, they write legislation. When you have scientifically illiterate adults, you have undermined the very fabric of what makes a nation wealthy and strong."
6557,"The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when you look for things like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. For me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And along the way, lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you."
6558,"The most successful people recognize that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation."
6559,"I dream of a world where the truth is what shapes people's politics, rather than politics shaping what people think is true."
6560,"When scientifically investigating the natural world, the only thing worse than a blind believer is a seeing denier."
6561,"The molecules that comprise our body are traceable to the crucibles of the centers of stars.These atoms and molecules are in us because, in fact, the universe is in us. And, we are not only figuratively, but literally, stardust."
6562,"People cited violation of the First Amendment when a New Jersey schoolteacher asserted that evolution and the Big Bang are not scientific and that Noah's ark carried dinosaurs. This case is not about the need to separate church and state; it's about the need to separate ignorant, scientifically illiterate people from the ranks of teachers."
6563,"We hunger for significance, for signs that our personal existence is of special meaning to the universe. To that end, we’re all too eager to deceive ourselves and others, to discern a sacred image in a grilled cheese sandwich or find a divine warning in a comet"
6564,It's better to understand something than to memorize something.
6565,Everyone should have their mind blown once a day.
6566,Our nation is turning into an idiocracy.
6567,Perhaps we’ve never been visited by aliens because they have looked upon earth and decided there’s no sign of intelligent life.
6568,"Imagination alone is not enough, because the reality of nature is far more wondrous than anything we can imagine"
6569,"We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically."
6570,To assert that the universe has a purpose implies the universe has intent. And intent implies a desired outcome. But who would do the desiring? And what would a desired outcome be? That carbon-based life is inevitable? Or that sentient primates are life's neurological pinnacle? Are answers to these questions even possible without expressing a profound bias of human sentiment? Of course humans were not around to ask these questions for 99.9999% of cosmic history. So if the purpose of the universe was to create humans then the cosmos was embarrassingly inefficient about it.
6571,No one is dumb who is curious. The people who don't ask questions remain clueless throughout their lives.
6572,
6573,
6574,"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite."
6575,You can never have an impact on society if you have not changed yourself.
6576,"Do not judge me by my success, judge me by how many times I fell down and got back up again."
6577,
6578,It only seems impossible until it's done.
6579,"Living isn't just about doing for yourself,but what you do for others as well."
6580,What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead.
6581,Fools multiply when wise men are silent.
6582,It is not where you start but how high you aim that matters for success.
6583,"Education is the great engine of personal development. It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor, that the son of a mineworker can become the head of the mine, that a child of farm workers can become the president of a great nation. It is what we make out of what we have, not what we are given, that separates one person from another."
6584,Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.
6585,Love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.
6586,
6587,A winner is a dreamer who never gives up
6588,Resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies.
6589,"May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears."
6590,We can change the world and make it a better place. It is in your hands to make a difference.
6591,"Our fear is not that we are inadequate, but that we are powerful beyond measure."
6592,Blaming things on the past does not make them better.
6593,There is nothing more dangerous than a humiliated man.
6594,There is no easy walk to freedom anywhere.
6595,I like friends who have independent minds because they tend to make you see problems from all angles.
6596,Thinking is one of the most important weapons in dealing with problems
6597,
6598,"The present moment contains past and future. The secret of transformation, is in the way we handle this very moment."
6599,"Happiness is not an individual matter. When you are able to bring relief, or bring back the smile to one person, not only that person profits, but you also profit."
6600,Many of us have been running all our lives. Practice stopping.
6601,"When you suffer, you can look deeply at your situation and find the many blessings that are already surrounding you. It is wonderful to sit with a pen and paper and write down all the conditions for happiness that are already there, already available to you right in this moment."
6602,"To be beautiful means to be yourself.You don't need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. When you are born a lotus flower, be a beautiful lotus flower, don't try to be a magnolia flower. If you crave acceptance and recognition and try to change yourself to fit what other people want you to be, you will suffer all your life. True happiness and true power lie in understanding yourself, accepting yourself, having confidence in yourself."
6603,"Our mind is the foundation of all our actions, whether they are actions of body, speech, or mind, i.e., thinking. Whatever we think, say, or do arises from our mind. What our consciousness consumes becomes the substance of our life, so we have to be very careful which nutriments we ingest."
6604,"Silence is essential. We need silence just as much as we need air, just as much as plants need light. If our minds are crowded with words and thoughts, there is no space for us."
6605,"The moment you understand the importance of loving yourself, you will stop hurting others."
6606,"Breathing in, I am aware that I am breathing in.
Breathing out, I am aware that I am breathing out.
Breathing in, I am grateful for this moment.
Breathing out, I smile.
Breathing in, I am aware of the preciousness of this day.
Breathing out, I vow to live deeply in this day."
6607,"When you learn how to suffer, you suffer much less."
6608,"Around us, life bursts with miracles--a glass of water, a ray of sunshine, a leaf, a caterpillar, a flower, laughter, raindrops. If you live in awareness, it is easy to see miracles everywhere. Each human being is a multiplicity of miracles. Eyes that see thousands of colors, shapes, and forms; ears that hear a bee flying or a thunderclap; a brain that ponders a speck of dust as easily as the entire cosmos; a heart that beats in rhythm with the heartbeat of all beings. When we are tired and feel discouraged by life's daily struggles, we may not notice these miracles, but they are always there."
6609,"You are me, and I am you. Isn't it obvious that we ""inter-are""? You cultivate the flower in yourself, so that I will be beautiful. I transform the garbage in myself, so that you will not have to suffer."
6610,You do not suffer because things are impermanent. You suffer because things are impermanent and you think they are permanent.
6611,"In every one of us there are good seeds and bad. We have the seed of brotherhood, love, compassion, insight. But we have also the seed of anger, hate, dissent."
6612,"Breath is the bridge which connects life to consciousness, which unites your body to your thoughts. Whenever your mind becomes scattered, use your breath as the means to take hold of your mind again."
6613,"Letting go gives us freedom, and freedom is the only condition for happiness. If, in our heart, we still cling to anything - anger, anxiety, or possessions - we cannot be free."
6614,No one is more worthy of your kindness and compassion than you are.
6615,In each of us is a seed of understanding. The seed is God.
6616,"When we give ourselves the chance to let go of all our tension, the body's natural capacity to heal itself can begin to work."
6617,You must love in such a way that the person you love feels free.
6618,"In our consciousness, there are many negative seeds and also many positive seeds. The practice is to avoid watering the negative seeds, and to identify and water the positive seeds every day."
6619,"Thanks to impermanence, everything is possible."
6620,"Go back and take care of yourself. Your body needs you, your feelings need you, your perceptions need you. Your suffering needs you to acknowledge it. Go home and be there for all these things."
6621,"Choose to be in touch with what is wonderful, refreshing, and healing within yourself and around you."
6622,
6623,
6624,"It's the possibility that keeps me going, not the guarantee."
6625,You might not believe it...but you make the world a better place when you smile.
6626,Nothing that’s worthwhile is ever easy. Remember that.
6627,"I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough."
6628,"You know, the smallest thing can change a life. In the blink of an eye, something happens by chance - and when you least expect it - since we’re on a course that you could have never planned, into a future you never imagined. Where will it take you? That’s the journey of our lives: our search for the light. But sometimes, finding the light means you must past through the deepest darkness."
6629,How far should a person go in the name of true love?
6630,"I mean, if the relationship can't survive the long term, why on earth would it be worth my time and energy for the short term?"
6631,Love hurts. There is nothing as painful as heartbreak. But in order to learn to love again you must learn to trust again.
6632,I want to wake up with you beside me in the mornings. I want to spend my evenings looking at you across the dinner table. I want to share every mundane detail of my day with you and hear every detail of yours. I want to laugh with you and fall asleep with you in my arms.
6633,"Thank you for coming into my life and giving me joy, thank you for loving me and receiving my love in return. Thank you for the memories I will cherish forever. But most of all, thank you for showing me that there will come a time when I can eventually let you go."
6634,The scariest thing about distance is that you don’t know whether they’ll miss you or forget you.
6635,"She wanted something else, something different, something more. Passion and romance, perhaps, or maybe quiet conversations in candlelit rooms, or perhaps something as simple as not being second."
6636,I dont think that we're meant to understand it all the time. I think that sometimes we just have to have faith.
6637,"The reason it hurts so much to separate is because our souls are connected. Maybe they always have been and will be. Maybe we've lived a thousand lives before this one and in each of them we've found each other. And maybe each time, we've been forced apart for the same reasons. That means that this goodbye is both a goodbye for the past ten thousand years and a prelude to what will come."
6638,"I love you now for what we've already shared, and I love you now in anticipation of all that's to come."
6639,Loving someone and having them love you back is the most precious thing in the world.
6640,It’s never too late to do the right thing.
6641,"What mattered most was knowing that love was mine to give, without strings or expectations."
6642,"If it’s over, then don’t let the past screw up the rest of your life."
6643,Being around someone who accepts and supports you will remind you to accept and support yourself.
6644,"It's possible to go on, no matter how impossible it seems."
6645,"I know that somehow, every step I took since the moment I could walk was a step towards finding you."
6646,"You're going to come across people in your life who will say all the right words at all the right times. But in the end, it's always their actions you should judge them by. It's actions, not words, that matter."
6647,
6648,"If you have the desire and passion to do something, and it's within God's will, you will achieve it."
6649,Just because I don't understand god's plans does not mean that he is not with me.

 ""If we look at our lives and concentrate on things that we don't have or wish to have, that doesn't change the circumstances. The truth is that we have to focus on what we have and make the best out of it."

6659,To wish for change will change nothing; To make the decision to take action right now will change everything.
6660,You can either be angry for what you don't have or thankful for what you do have. Do your best and God will do the rest.

6666,
6667,"The greatest rewards come when you give of yourself. It's about bettering the lives of others, being part of something bigger than yourself, and making a positive difference."
6668,"Often people ask how I manage to be happy despite having no arms and no legs. The quick answer is that I have a choice. I can be angry about not having limbs, or I can be thankful that I have a purpose. I chose gratitude."
6669,It's a lie to think you're not good enough. It's a lie to think you're not worth anything.
6670,"In life you have a choice: Bitter or Better? Choose better, forget bitter."
6671,Fear is a bigger disability than having no arms and no legs.
6672,
6673,Forget the past. You can never predict what the future is going to be. Live for the moment.
6674,Sometimes your mistakes are you biggest virtues. You learn so much from the mistake. Those things that you think are the worst thing that's happening to you can somehow turn around and be the greatest opportunity.
6675,Breathe and don't try to be perfect.
6676,"Whatever you do in life, don't give up on your own dreams."
6677,"Men don't pay you for sex, they pay you to leave after sex."

6679,"No matter how much you're going to be criticized or no matter how big of a risk it is, the boldness is the thing that helps you"
6680,"I always try to push through fear. I won't be crippled by it. People say, ""Oh  you take such risks"", or ""You're brave."" And I'm like, 'Well, if you knew - inside I'm really frightened!' But the way people navigate fear and pain is fascinating... The more you feel, the stronger the pain. And the more you engage in life, the more you have to lose."
6681,"I'm not sure what the future holds but I do know that I'm going to be positive and not wake up feeling desperate. As my dad said 'Nic, it is what it is, it's not what it should have been, not what it could have been, it is what it is.'"
6682,You can't find peace by hiding from life
6683,"Have no regrets. Every relationship leads you to where you're meant to be. Learn to be comfortable with being alone. Learn to be comfortable with saying no to people; we put everybody else before ourselves. Read great literature; don't get all your information from TV. Define your moral code - nobody else is going to give you that. Find it yourself. Keep asking questions, keep challenging. You don't have to conform. Rebellion creates character. And, as my mother always said to me, ""Don't let anyone break your spirit!"""
6684,"If you enter the dark side of life, and come through it, you emerge with more strength and passion."

6695,I like exploring life and its complexities.

6700,"Winners compare their achievements with their goals, while losers compare their achievements with those of other people."
6701,"Are you a thermometer or a thermostat?  A thermometer only reflects the temperature of its  environment, adjusting to the situation. But a thermostat initiates  action to change the temperature in its environment"

6717,Those who are afraid to fail may not deserve to succeed.
6718,Material success may result in the accumulation of possessions: but only spiritual success will enable you to enjoy them.
6719,One of the greatest resources people cannot mobilize themselves is that they try to accomplish great things. Most worthwhile achievements are the result of many little things done in a single direction.
6720,People who invariably put themselves first will find that others tend to put them last.
6721,To acquire balance means to achieve that happy medium between the minimum and the maximum that represents your optimum. The minimum is the least you can get by with.

6737,Peace can only come as a natural consequence of universal enlightenment.
6738,"Alpha waves in the human brain are between 6 and 8 hertz. The wave frequency of the human cavity resonates between 6 and 8 hertz. All biological systems operate in the same frequency range. The human brain's alpha waves function in this range and the electrical resonance of the earth is between 6 and 8 hertz. Thus, our entire biological system - the brain and the earth itself - work on the same frequencies. If we can control that resonate system electronically, we can directly control the entire mental system of humankind."

6747,
6748,
6749,"The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum - even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there's free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate."
6750,Nobody is going to pour truth into your brain. It's something you have to find out for yourself.

6752,He who controls the media controls the minds of the public.
6753,"Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, it’s unlikely you will step up and take responsibility for making it so. If you assume that there’s no hope, you guarantee that there will be no hope. If you assume that there is an instinct for freedom, there are opportunities to change things, there’s a chance you may contribute to making a better world. The choice is yours."
6754,"It takes one minute to tell a lie, and an hour to refute it."

6756,"The key element of social control is the strategy of distraction that is to divert public attention from important issues and changes decided by political and economic elites, through the technique of flood or flooding continuous distractions and insignificant information."
6757,Democratic societies can't force people. Therefore they have to control what they think.
6758,It’s ridiculous to talk about freedom in a society dominated by huge corporations. What kind of freedom is there inside a corporation? They’re totalitarian institutions - you take orders from above and maybe give them to people below you. There’s about as much freedom as under Stalinism.
6759,"That's the standard technique of privatization: defund, make sure things don't work, people get angry, you hand it over to private capital."
6760,"The public is not to see where power lies, how it shapes policy, and for what ends. Rather, people are to hate and fear one another."
6761,"The process of shaping opinion, attitudes, and perceptions was termed the 'engineering of consent' by one of the founders of the modern public relations industry, Edward Bernays."
6762,
6763,"If you assume that there is no hope, you guarantee that there will be no hope. If you assume that there is an instinct for freedom, that there are opportunities to change things, then there is a possibility that you can contribute to making a better world."
6764,"Neoliberal democracy. Instead of citizens, it produces consumers. Instead of communities, it produces shopping malls. The net result is an atomized society of disengaged individuals who feel demoralized and socially powerless. In sum, neoliberalism is the immediate and foremost enemy of genuine participatory democracy, not just in the United States but across the planet, and will be for the foreseeable future."
6765,"The whole educational and professional training system is a very elaborate filter, which just weeds out people who are too independent, and who think for themselves, and who don't know how to be submissive, and so on -- because they're dysfunctional to the institutions."
6766,"If voting could actually change anything, it would be illegal."
6767,"Globalization is the result of powerful governments, especially that of the United States, pushing trade deals and other accords down the throats of the world’s people to make it easier for corporations and the wealthy to dominate the economies of nations around the world without having obligations to the peoples of those nations."
6768,"Jingoism, racism, fear, religious fundamentalism: these are the ways of appealing to people if you're trying to organize a mass base of support for policies that are really intended to crush them."
6769,"The point of public relations slogans like ""Support Our Troops"" is that they don't mean anything ... that's the whole point of good propaganda. You want to create a slogan that nobody is going to be against and I suppose everybody will be for, because nobody knows what it means, because it doesn't mean anything. But its crucial value is that it diverts your attention from a question that does mean something, do you support our policy? And that's the one you're not allowed to talk about."
6770,Nobody should have any illusions. The United States has essentially a one-party system and the ruling party is the business party.
6771,"A language is not just words. It's a culture, a tradition, a unification of a community, a whole history that creates what a community is. It's all embodied in a language."
6772,
6773,"Whatever you choose, however many roads you travel, I hope that you choose not to be a lady. I hope you will find some way to break the rules and make a little trouble out there. And I also hope that you will choose to make some of that trouble on behalf of women."

6777,"You're born, you die. Everything in between is subject to interpretation."
6778,"Reading is everything. Reading makes me feel like I've accomplished something, learned something, become a better person. Reading makes me smarter. Reading gives me something to talk about later on. Reading is the unbelievably healthy way my attention deficit disorder medicates itself. Reading is escape, and the opposite of escape; it's a way to make contact with reality after a day of making things up, and it's a way of making contact with someone else's imagination after a day that's all too real. Reading is grist. Reading is bliss."
6779,"So, twice a week, I go to a beauty salon and have my hair blown dry. It’s cheaper by far than psychoanalysis, and much more uplifting."
6780,And don't be frightened: you can always change your mind. I know: I've had four careers and three husbands.
6781,Most of us live our lives devoid of cinematic moments.
6782,"When I buy a new book, I always read the last page first, that way in case I die before I finish, I know how it ends. That, my friend, is a dark side."
6783,I don't think any day is worth living without thinking about what you're going to eat next at all times.
6784,"Here are some questions I am constantly noodling over: Do you splurge or do you hoard? Do you live every day as if it's your last, or do you save your money on the chance you'll live twenty more years? Is life too short, or is it going to be too long? Do you work as hard as you can, or do you slow down to smell the roses? And where do carbohydrates fit into all this? Are we really all going to spend our last years avoiding bread, especially now that bread in American is so unbelievable delicious? And what about chocolate?"
6785,"When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible."

6787,You can't meet someone until you become what you're becoming.
6788,Never marry a man you wouldn't want to be divorced from.
6789,"You do get to a certain point in life where you have to realistically, I think, understand that the days are getting shorter, and you can't put things off thinking you'll get to them someday. If you really want to do them, you better do them. There are simply too many people getting sick, and sooner or later you will. So I'm very much a believer in knowing what it is that you love doing so you can do a great deal of it."
6790,I'm very much a believer in knowing what it is that you love doing so you can do a great deal of it.
6791,"I think if you're lucky enough to find a voice in whatever you do, that voice will come sneaking out no matter what."
6792,Take notes. Everything is copy.
6793,"Everyone always asks, was he mad at you for writing the book? and I have to say, Yes, yes, he was. He still is. It is one of the most fascinating things to me about the whole episode: he cheated on me, and then got to behave as if he was the one who had been wronged because I wrote about it! I mean, it's not as if I wasn't a writer. It's not as if I hadn't often written about myself. I'd even written about him. What did he think was going to happen? That I would take a vow of silence for the first time in my life? """
6794,"Oh, how I regret not having worn a bikini for the entire year I was twenty-six. If anyone young is reading this, go, right this minute, put on a bikini, and don't take it off until you're thirty-four."
6795,"Reading is escape, and the opposite of escape."
6796,"And so, Thanksgiving. Its the most amazing holiday. Just think about it — it's a miracle that once a year so many millions of Americans sit down to exactly the same meal as one another, exactly the same meal they grew up eating, and exactly the same meal they ate a year earlier. The turkey. The sweet potatoes. The stuffing. The pumpkin pie. Is there anything else we all can agree so vehemently about? I don't think so."
6797,
6798,"There's no reward without work, no victory without effort, no battle won without risk."
6799,"know what you want, work to get it, then value it once you have it."

6816,"You spend your life getting walked on, you learn to recognize the tread."
6817,"Do you know how many ways love can hit you? So it makes you happy, or miserable? It makes you sick in the belly or hurt in the heart. It makes everything brighter and sharper, or it blurs all the edges. It makes you feel like a king or a fool. Every way love can hit you, it's hit me when it comes to you."
6818,You have to believe in it to get it.
6819,Good fiction creates its own reality.

6822,"Be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind. Talk health, happiness, and prosperity to every person you meet. Make all your friends feel there is something special in them. Look at the sunny side of everything. Think only the best, be as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. Forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future. Give everyone a smile. Spend so much time improving yourself that you have no time left to criticize others. Be too big for worry and too noble for anger."
6823,A positive thinker does not refuse to recognize the negative; he refuses to dwell on it. Positive thinking is a form of thought which habitually looks for the best results from the worst conditions
6824,A peaceful mind generates power.

6828,
6829,Dwelling on negative thoughts is like fertilizing weeds.
6830,"One of the most powerful concepts, one which is a sure cure for lack of confidence, is the thought that God is with you and helping you. This is one of the simplest teachings in religion, namely, that Almighty God will be your companion, will stand by you, help you, and see you through. No other idea is so powerful in developing self-confidence as this simple belief when practiced. To practice it simply affirm ""God is with me; God is helping me; God is guiding me."" Spend several minutes each day visualizing his presence. Then practice believing that affirmation."

 your power to change things."

You have to have a marriage so awesome that you don’t have to look at the character of a movie or a play and say ‘i wish i had a marriage like this’, your marriage should be better than that because otherwise, Sheytan will come to each one of you and say ‘man i wonder, is there anything better out there, why am I stuck in this?’ Both husband and wife have to work hard to make their relationship work not for yourselves but for your eeman!"

6853,Sabr is not remaining quiet and allowing anger to build up inside you. Sabr is to talk about what's bothering you without losing control of your emotions.
6854,"Every single success you experience is a combination of two things: your effort and Allah's help. When you don't put in enough effort, Allah does not give His barakah. And sometimes you might put in a lot of effort but you may not see the result you expected. That, also, is Allah's barakah."

6866,"It is not true that if we had true faith we would not be sad. Prophets (as), and righteous people experienced a great deal of sadness. The Quran is full of stories in which the central theme is sadness. Sadness is a reality of life. The Quran is not there to eliminate sadness, but to navigate it. Sadness is one of the tests of life, just as happiness, and anger are tests."
6867,"When you find yourself in a position to help someone, be happy because Allah is answering that person’s prayer through you."
6868,"Forget bad deeds, even the good we do are full of mistakes."
6869,The real Da'wah to Islam is the character of a Muslim.
6870,"Every single night our soul is taken, and every single night the Angel asks before bringing it back, ""Ya Allah what about this one?"" ""Do You want to send it back?"" Do You want to pull the plug or should we keep the Ruh (soul)?"" And every night Allah gives permission to the Angel to let us live one more time."""

 have is what ALLAH wants."

6873,"The Mexican...is familiar with death. [He] jokes about it, caresses it, sleeps with it, celebrates it. It is one of his favorite toys and his most steadfast love."
6874,"A flower without a stem, is beauty waiting to die. A heart without love, is a tear waiting to cry."
6875,"What sets worlds in motion is the interplay of differences, their attractions and repulsions. Life is plurality, death is uniformity. By suppressing differences and pecularities, by eliminating different civilizations and cultures, progress weakens life and favors death. The ideal of a single civilization for everyone, implicit in the cult of progress and technique, impoverishes and mutilates us. Every view of the world that becomes extinct, every culture that disappears, diminishes a possibility of life"
6876,Deserve your dream.
6877,Love is not a desire for beauty; it is a yearning for completion.
6878,Solitude is the profoundest fact of the human condition. Man is the only being who knows he is alone.
6879,"The supreme value is not the future but the present. The future is a deceitful time that always says to us, 'Not Yet,' and thus denies us... Whoever builds a house for future happiness builds a prison for the present."
6880,A civilization that denies death ends by denying life.
6881,Light is time thinking about itself.
6882,"Reality is a staircase going neither up nor down, we don't move; today is today, always is today."
6883,"To love is to battle, to open doors, to cease to be a ghost with a number forever in chains, forever condemned by a faceless master; the world changes if two look at each other and see."
6884,The purpose of poetry is to restore to mankind the possibility to wonder.
6885,To read a poem is to hear it with our eyes; to hear it is to see it with our ears.
6886,"Beyond happiness or unhappiness, though it is both things, love is intensity; it does not give us eternity but life, that second in which the doors of time and space open just a crack: here is there and now is always."
6887,To love is to undress our names.
6888,To fight evil is to fight ourselves.
6889,Believing ourselves to be possessors of absolute truth degrades us: we regard every person whose way of thinking is different from ours as a monster and a threat and by so doing turn our own selves into monsters and threats to our fellows.
6890,"Love is an attempt at penetrating another being, but it can only succeed if the surrender is mutual."
6891,Every moment is nothing without end.
6892,"Eroticism is first and foremost a thirst for otherness. And the supernatural is the supreme otherness. This is perhaps the most noble aim of poetry, to attach ourselves to the world around us, to turn desire into love, to embrace, finally what always evades us, what is beyond, but what is always there – the unspoken, the spirit, the soul."
6893,Modern man likes to pretend that his thinking is wide-awake. But this wide-awake thinking has led us into the mazes of a nightmare in which the torture chambers are endlessly repeated in the mirrors of reason.
6894,"Distraction is our habitual state. Not the distraction of the person who withdraws from the world in order to shut himself up in the secret and ever-changing land of his fantasy, but the distraction of the person who is always outside himself, lost in the trivial, senseless, turmoil of everyday life."
6895,"My body, plowed by your body, will turn into a field where one is sown and a hundred reaped."
6896,The world is born when two people kiss
6897,
6898,"Realize that true happiness lies within you. Waste no time and effort searching for peace and contentment and joy in the world outside. Remember that there is no happiness in having or in getting, but only in giving. Reach out. Share. Smile. Hug. Happiness is a perfume you cannot pour on others without getting a few drops on yourself."
6899,"Your only limitations are those you set up in your mind, or permit others to set up for you."
6900,I will greet this day with love in my heart. And how will I do this? Henceforth will I look on all things with love and be born again. I will love the sun for it warms my bones; yet I will love the rain for it cleanses my spirit. I will love the light for it shows me the way; yet I will love the darkness for it shows me the stars. I will welcome happiness as it enlarges my heart; yet I will endure sadness for it opens my soul. I will acknowledge rewards for they are my due; yet I will welcome obstacles for they are my challenge.
6901,"Beginning today, treat everyone you meet as if they were going to be dead by midnight. Extend to them all the care, kindness and understanding you can muster, and do it with no thought of any reward. Your life will never be the same again."
6902,"Count your blessings. Once you realize how valuable you are and how much you have going for you, the smiles will return, the sun will break out, the music will play, and you will finally be able to move forward the life that God intended for you with grace, strength, courage, and confidence."
6903,Victory comes only after many struggles and countless defeats.
6904,"Never allow anyone to rain on your parade and thus cast a pall of gloom and defeat on the entire day. Remember that no talent, no self-denial, no brains, no character, are required to set up in the fault-finding business. Nothing external can have any power over you unless you permit it. Your time is too precious to be sacrificed in wasted days combating the menial forces of hate, jealously, and envy. Guard your fragile life carefully. Only God can shape a flower, but any foolish child can pull it to pieces."
6905,"Remember that the most difficult tasks are consummated, not by a single explosive burst of energy or effort, but by the constant daily application of the best you have within you."
6906,Shake off your blunders. How will you know your limits without an occasional failure? Never quit. Your turn will come.
6907,"Take the attitude of a student, never be too big to ask questions, never know too much to learn something new."
6908,I will welcome happiness for it enlarges my heart; Yet I will endure sadness for it opens my soul. I will acknowledge rewards for they are my due; Yet I will welcome obstacles for they are my challenge.
6909,
6910,All the gold in the world cannot buy a dying man one more breath--so what does that make today worth?
6911,"So long as I can laugh, never will I be poor."
6912,"The only certain means of success is to render more and better service than is expected of you, no matter what the task may be. This is a habit followed by all successful people since the beginning of time. Therefore I saith the surest way to doom yourself to mediocrity is to perform only the work for which you are paid."
6913,"Welcome every morning with a smile. Look on the new day as another special gift from your Creator, another golden opportunity to complete what you were unable to finish yesterday. Be a self-starter. Let your first hour set the theme of success and positive action that is certain to echo through your entire day. Today will never happen again. Don't waste it with a false start or no start at all. You were not born to fail."
6914,"Always do your best. What you plant now, you will harvest later."

6918,"What is past is past. You can do nothing about yesterday and last month and the failures of last year, but you can do everything toward making tomorrow and the rest of your life what you always dreamed it could be."
6919,"Whenever you make a mistake or get knocked down by life, don't look back at it too long. Mistakes are life's way of teaching you. Your capacity for occasional blunders is inseparable from your capacity to reach your goals. No one wins them all, and your failures, when they happen, are just part of your growth. Shake off your blunders. How will you know your limits without an occasional failure? Never quit. Your turn will come."
6920,"I will persist until I succeed. Always will I take another step. If that is of no avail I will take another, and yet another. In truth, one step at a time is not too difficult... I know that small attempts, repeated, will complete any undertaking."
6921,"I am here for a purpose and that purpose is to grow into a mountain, not to shrink to a grain of sand."
6922,
6923,"Whenever you're wrong, admit it; Whenever you're right, shut up."
6924,The door of a bigoted mind opens outwards so that the only result of the pressure of facts upon it is to close it more snugly.
6925,
6926,"Some tortures are physical And some are mental, But the one that is both Is dental."
6927,God in His wisdom made the fly And then forgot to tell us why.
6928,"Among other things I think humor is a shield, a weapon, a survival kit. So here we are several billion of us, crowded into our global concentration camp for the duration. How are we to survive? Solemnity is not the answer, any more than witless and irresponsible frivolity is. I think our best chance lies in humor, which in this case means a wry acceptance of our predicament. We don't have to like it but we can at least recognize its ridiculous aspects, one of which is ourselves."
6929,One thing about the past. It's likely to last.
6930,"Marriage is the alliance of two people, one of whom never remembers birthdays and the other who never forgets them."

Fell through the parlor floor today."

6941,I believe that people believe what they believe they believe.
6942,"Abracadabra, thus we learn
The more you create, the less you earn.
The less you earn, the more you're given,
The less you lead, the more you're driven,
The more destroyed, the more they feed,
The more you pay, the more they need,
The more you earn, the less you keep,
And now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to take
If the tax-collector hasn't got it before I wake."
6943,Too much Chablis can make you whablis.
6944,"The truth I do not stretch or shove
 When I state the dog is full of love.
 I've also proved, by actual test,
 A wet dog is the lovingest."

6947,
6948,"The Spirit of prayer makes us so intimate with God that we scarcely pass through an experience before we speak to Him about it, either in supplication, in sighing, in pouring out our woes before Him, in fervent requests, or in thanksgiving and adoration."
6949,"To pray is to let God into our lives. He knocks and seeks admittance, not only in the solemn hours of secret prayer. He knocks in the midst of your daily work, your daily struggles, your daily grind. That is when you need Him most."

At such times it is wonderful to say to God, ""May I be in Thy presence, Lord? I have nothing more to say to Thee, but I do love to be in Thy presence."""
6953,"See to it, night and day, that you pray for your children. Then you will leave them a great legacy of answers to prayer, which will follow them all the days of their life. Then you may calmly and with a good conscience depart from them, even though you may not leave them a great deal of material wealth."
6954,"Begin to realize more and more that prayer is the most important thing you do. You can use your time to no better advantage than to pray whenever you have an opportunity to do so, either alone or with others; while at work, while at rest, or while walking down the street. Anywhere!"
6955,"It is God's will not only to hear our prayer, but to give us the best and the richest answer which He, the almighty and omniscient God, can devise. He will send us the answer when it will benefit us and His cause the most."
6956,"Notice carefully every word here. It is not our prayer which draws Jesus into our hearts. Nor is it our prayer which moves Jesus to come in to us. All He needs is access. He enters in of His own accord, because He desires to come in. To pray is nothing more involved than to let Jesus into our needs, and permitting Him to exercise His own power in dealing with them. And that requires no strength. It is only a question of our wills. Will we give Jesus access to our needs?."
6957,"Jesus is not made of stone. He is moved to happiness every time He sees that you appreciate what He has done for you. Grip His pierced hand and say to Him, ""I thank Thee, Savior , because Thou hast died for me."" Thank Him likewise for all the other blessings He has showered upon you from day to day."
6958,Be sure to remember that nothing in your daily life is so insignificant and so inconsequential that the Lord will not help you by answering your prayer.
6959,"Our prayer life will become restful when it really dawns upon us that we have done all we are supposed to do when we have spoken to Him about it. From the moment we have left it with Him, it is His responsi-bility."

6963,Only he who is helpless can truly pray.
6964,"Pray a little each day in a childlike way for the Spirit of prayer. If you feel that you know, as yet, very little concerning the deep things of prayer and what prayer really is, then pray for the Spirit of prayer. There is nothing He would rather do than unveil to you the grace of prayer."
6965,We need to learn to know Him so well that we feel safe when we have left our difficulties with Him. To know in that way is a prerequisite of all true prayer.
6966,"A humble and contrite heart knows that it can merit nothing before God, and that all that is necessary is to be reconciled to one's helplessness and let our holy and almighty God care for us, just as an infant surrenders himself to his mother's care."
6967,Helplessness is your best prayer. It calls from your heart to the heart of God with greater effect than all your uttered pleas.
6968,"As impossible as it is for us to take a breath in the morning large enough to last us until noon, so impossible is it to pray in the morning in such a way as to last us until noon. Let your prayers ascend to Him constantly, audibly or silently, as circumstances throughout the day permit."
6969,"My praying friend, continue to make known your desires to God in all things. ... Let Him decide whether you are to receive what you ask for or not."

6974,
6975,"Music can move us to the heights or depths of emotion. It can persuade us to buy something, or remind us of our first date. It can lift us out of depression when nothing else can. It can get us dancing to its beat. But the power of music goes much, much further. Indeed, music occupies more areas of our brain than language does-humans are a musical species."
6976,"In examining disease, we gain wisdom about anatomy and physiology and biology. In examining the person with disease, we gain wisdom about life."
6977,"To live on a day-to-day basis is insufficient; we need to transcend, transport, escape; we need meaning, understanding, and explanation; we need to see over-all patterns in our lives. We need hope, the sense of a future; the freedom to get beyond ourselves...in states of mind that allow us to rise above our immediate surroundings and see the beauty and value of the world we live in."
6978,The power of music to integrate and cure. . . is quite fundamental. It is the profoundest nonchemical medication.
6979,"We see with the eyes, but we see with the brain as well. And seeing with the brain is often called imagination."
6980,"Above all, I have been a sentient being, a thinking animal, on this beautiful planet, and that in itself has been an enormous privilege and adventure."
6981,"If we wish to know about a man, we ask 'what is his story--his real, inmost story?'--for each of us is a biography, a story. Each of us is a singular narrative, which is constructed, continually, unconsciously, by, through, and in us--through our perceptions, our feelings, our thoughts, our actions; and, not least, our discourse, our spoken narrations. Biologically, physiologically, we are not so different from each other; historically, as narratives--we are each of us unique."
6982,"Every act of perception, is to some degree an act of creation, and every act of memory is to some degree an act of imagination."
6983,My religion is nature. That’s what arouses those feelings of wonder and mysticism and gratitude in me.
6984,"Music can lift us out of depression or move us to tears - it is a remedy, a tonic, orange juice for the ear. But for many of my neurological patients, music is even more - it can provide access, even when no medication can, to movement, to speech, to life. For them, music is not a luxury, but a necessity."
6985,"People will make a life in their own terms, whether they are deaf or colorblind or autistic or whatever. And their world will be quite as rich and interesting and full as our world."
6986,"We speak not only to tell other people what we think, but to tell ourselves what we think. Speech is a part of thought."
6987,"The brain is more than an assemblage of autonomous modules, each crucial for a specific mental function. Every one of these functionally specialized areas must interact with dozens or hundreds of others, their total integration creating something like a vastly complicated orchestra with thousands of instruments, an orchestra that conducts itself, with an ever-changing score and repertoire."
6988,Much more of the brain is devoted to movement than to language. Language is only a little thing sitting on top of this huge ocean of movement.
6989,There is only one cardinal rule: One must always listen to the patient.
6990,"If a man has lost a leg or an eye, he knows he has lost a leg or an eye; but if he has lost a self—himself—he cannot know it, because he is no longer there to know it."

6993,"Music has a bonding power, it's primal social cement"
6994,I regard music therapy as a tool of great power in many neurological disorders -- Parkinson's and Alzheimer's -- because of its unique capacity to organize or reorganize cerebral function when it has been damaged.
6995,"Music, uniquely among the arts, is both completely abstract and profoundly emotional. It has no power to represent anything particular or external, but it has a unique power to express inner states or feelings. Music can pierce the heart directly; it needs no mediation."
6996,"To be ourselves we must have ourselves – possess, if need be re-possess, our life-stories. We must “recollect” ourselves, recollect the inner drama, the narrative, of ourselves. A man needs such a narrative, a continuous inner narrative, to maintain his identity, his self."
6997,"Creativity involves the depth of a mind, and many, many depths of unconsciousness."
6998,"There is no one part of the brain which recognizes or responds emotionally to music. Instead, there are many different parts responding to different aspects of music: to pitch, to frequency, to timbre, to tonal intervals, to consonance, to dissonance, to rhythm, to melodic contour, to harmony."

7019,"We are all tattooed in our cradles with the beliefs of our tribe; the record may seem superficial, but it is indelible. You cannot educate a man wholly out of the superstitious fears which were early implanted in his imagination; no matter how utterly his reason may reject them..."
7020,A moment's insight is sometimes worth a life's experience.
7021,Civilization is the process of reducing the infinite to the finite.

7028,"Success. Is not the position where you are standing, but which direction you are going."
7029,"I find the great thing in this world is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are moving: To reach the port of heaven, we must sail sometimes with the wind and sometimes against it, but we must sail, and not drift, nor lie at anchor."
7030,The mark of a civilized man is his willingness to re-examine his most cherished beliefs.
7031,"This is a court of law, not a court of justice."
7032,"If there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the principle of free thought, not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate."
7033,"Certitude leads to violence. This is a proposition that has an easy application and a difficult one. The easy application is to ideoologues, dogmatists, and bullies--people who think that their rigtness justifies them in imposing on anyone who does not happen to suscribe to their particular ideology, dogma or notion of turf. If the conviction of rightness is powerful enough, resistance to it will be met, sooner or later by force. There are people like this in every sphere of life, and it is natural to feel that the world would be a better place without them!"
7034,Even a dog distinguishes between being stumbled over and being kicked.
7035,"I like to pay taxes. With them, I buy civilization."
7036,"The history of intellectual growth and discovery clearly demonstrates the need for unfettered freedom, the right to think the unthinkable, discuss the unmentionable, and challenge the unchallengeable. To curtail free expression strikes twice at intellectual freedom, for whoever deprives another of the right to state unpopular views necessarily also deprives others of the right to listen to those views."
7037,Taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society.
7038,"Young men know the rules, but old men know the exceptions."

7060,"Dependability, integrity, the characteristic of never knowingly doing anything wrong, that you would never cheat anyone, that you would give everybody a fair deal. Character is a sort of an all-inclusive thing. If a man has character, everyone has confidence in him."
7061,"The smell of death overwhelmed us even before we passed through the stockade. More than 3200 naked, emaciated bodies had been flung into shallow graves. Others lay in the streets where they had fallen. ... Eisenhower's face whitened into a mask. Patton walked over to a corner and sickened. I was too revolted to speak. For here death had been so fouled by degradation that it both stunned and numbed us."

People will turn out to be the opposite of what you thought. Allah is perfect. His Messenger (peace be upon him) is a perfect example, and the religion is a perfect methodology.

7081,Wake up knowing that Allah is greater than any obstacle you may face today.
7082,One thing I've always struggled with in life is loving people too much. It's painful when that love is not reciprocated.

7097,Sometimes Allah gives you bitterness in this life so that you can further enjoy the sweetness of the hereafter.
7098,"Don't go into Ramadan having hurt anyone without seeking their forgiveness. The last thing you'd want on the day of judgment is to find that your entire Ramadan with all of its quran recitation, fasting, taraweeh prayers, laylatul qadr, etc. went completely to waste because your pride stopped you from saying “I'm sorry”. With that being said, I'm sorry if I've written, said, or done anything to offend you. Please find it in your heart to forgive and make dua that Allah grants me guidance and sincerity."

7128,"Your faith begins to move, to act, when the power of God supernaturally empties you of doubt and fills you with a knowing. You come into a state of knowing that you know that you know. In that instant you cannot doubt."

7173,"A lobster, when left high and dry among the rock, does not have the sense enough to work his way back to the sea, but waits for the sea to come to him. If it does not come, he remains where he is and dies, although the slightest effort would enable him to reach the waves, which are perhaps within a yard of him. The world is full of human lobsters; people stranded on the rocks of indecision and procrastination, who, instead of putting forth their own energies, are waiting for some grand billow of good fortune to set them afloat."
7174,Opportunities? They are all around us ... There is power lying latent everywhere waiting for the observant eye to discover it.

7179,"If you want to enlarge your life, you must first enlarge your thought of it and of yourself."
7180,"Self-Control is the very essence of character. To be able to look a man straight in the eye, calmly and deliberately, without the slightest ruffle of temper under extreme provocation, gives a sense of power which nothing else can give. To feel that you are always, not sometimes, master of yourself, gives a dignity and strength to character, buttresses it, supports it on every side, as nothing else can. This is the culmination of thought mastery."
7181,We lift ourselves by our own thought; we climb upon our vision of ourselves.
7182,Believe with all your heart that you will do what you were made to do.
7183,Obstacles will look large or small to you according to whether you are large or small.

7202,"My theory is that everything went to hell with Prohibition, because it was a law nobody could obey. So the whole concept of the rule of law was corrupted at that moment. Then came Vietnam, and marijuana, which clearly shouldn't be illegal, but is. If you go to jail for ten years in Texas when you light up a joint, who are you? You're a lawbreaker. It's just like Prohibition was. When people accept breaking the law as normal, something happens to the whole society, you see?"

7204,When you are down and out something always turns up - and it is usually the noses of your friends.

7264,"God is not concerned about our plans; He doesn’t ask, “Do you want to go through this loss of a loved one, this difficulty, or this defeat?” No, He allows these things for His own purpose. The things we are going through are either making us sweeter, better, and nobler men and women, or they are making us more critical and fault-finding, and more insistent on our own way.

7273,"Leave the Irreparable Past in His hands, and step out into the Irresistible Future with Him."
7274,"God brings you to places, among people, and into certain conditions to accomplish a definite purpose through the intercession of the Spirit in you. Your part in intercessory prayer is not to agonize over how to intercede, but to use the everyday circumstances and people God puts around you by His providence to bring them before His throne, and to allow the Spirit in you the opportunity to intercede for them. In this way God is going to touch the whole world with His saints."
7275,"Get into the habit of dealing with God about everything. Unless in the first waking moment of the day you learn to fling the door wide back and let God in, you will work on a wrong level all day; but swing the door wide open and pray to your Father in secret, and every public thing will be stamped with the presence of God."
7276,"God never forces a person's will into surrender, and He never begs. He patiently waits until that person willingly yields to Him. True surrender is a matter of being 'united together [with Jesus] in the likeness of His death' (Romans 6:5) until nothing ever appeals to you that did not appeal to Him. And after you surrender--then what? Your entire life should be characterized by an eagerness to maintain unbroken fellowship and oneness with God."

7278,"Spiritual maturity is not reached by the passing of the years, but by obedience to the will of God. Some people mature into an understanding of God’s will more quickly than others because they obey more readily; they more readily sacrifice the life of nature to the will of God."

7287,"Oh my friends, we are loaded with countless church activities, while the real work of the church, that of evangelizing and winning the lost is almost entirely neglected."
7288,"I am perfectly confident that the man who does not spend hours alone with God will never know the anointing of the Holy Spirit. The world must be left outside until God alone fills the vision...God has promised to answer prayer. It is not that He is unwilling, for the fact is, He is more willing to give than we are to receive. But the trouble is, we are not ready..."
7289,"Oh, to realize that souls, precious, never dying souls, are perishing all around us, going out into the blackness of darkness and despair, eternally lost, and yet to feel no anguish, shed no tears, know no travail! How little we know of the compassion of Jesus!"
7290,"It matters not how spiritual a church may profess to be, if souls are not saved, something is radically wrong, and the professed spirituality is simply a false 
 experience, a delusion of the devil. People who are 
 satisfied to meet together simply to have a good time 
 among themselves are far away from God. Real 
 spirituality always has an outcome."
7291,The supreme task of the church is the evangelization of the world. No one has the right to hear the gospel twice until everyone has had an opportunity to hear it at least once.
7292,"Oh, how few find time for prayer! There is time for everything else, time to sleep and time to eat, time to read the newspaper and the novel, time to visit friends, time for everything else under the sun, but-no time for prayer, the most important of all things, the one great essential!"
7293,The church that does not evangelize will fossilize.
7294,"I want Thy plan, O God, for my life. May I be happy and contented whether in the homeland or on the foreign field; whether married or alone, in happiness or sorrow, health or sickness, prosperity or adversity -- I want Thy plan, O God, for my life. I want it; oh, I want it."
7295,The light that shines the farthest will shine the brightest at home.
7296,"The heart of the human problem, is the problem of the human heart."
7297,Our work is to preach the gospel and we must not be sidetracked.
7298,"The Lord did not tell us to build beautiful churches, but to evangelize the world"
7299,The mission of the church is missions.
7300,"In the Irish Revival of 1859, people became so weak that they 
could not get back to their homes. Men and women would fall by 
the wayside and would be found hours later pleading with God to 
save their souls. They felt that they were slipping into hell and that 
nothing else in life mattered but to get right with God... To them 
eternity meant everything. Nothing else was of any consequence. 
They felt that if God did not have mercy on them and save them, 
they were doomed for all time to come."
7301,"No one has the right to hear the gospel twice, while there remains someone who has not heard it once."
7302,"We all want to do the will of God, and we know that there is nothing nearer to His heart than the evangelization of the world."
7303,The only generation that can reach this generation is our generation.
7304,"Let me say that it is not a question of us getting more of the Holy Spirit, but rather of the Holy Spirit getting more of us."

7306,He who would preach powerfully must pray effectively.
7307,You must go or send a substitute.

7334,
7335,
7336,
7337,"I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close."
7338,"Love is not about property, diamonds and gifts. It is about sharing your very self with the world around you."
7339,
7340,"He who does not travel, who does not read, 
 who does not listen to music, 
 who does not find grace in himself, 
 she who does not find grace in herself, 
 dies slowly."
7341,"There is no insurmountable solitude. All paths lead to the same goal: to convey to others what we are. And we must pass through solitude and difficulty, isolation and silence in order to reach forth to the enchanted place where we can dance our clumsy dance and sing our sorrowful song - but in this dance or in this song there are fulfilled the most ancient rites of our conscience in the awareness of being human and of believing in a common destiny."
7342,In you is the illusion of each day. You arrive like the dew to the cupped flowers. You undermine the horizon with your absence. Eternally in flight like the wave.
7343,"In one kiss, you'll know all I haven't said."
7344,
7345,Every day you play with the light of the universe.
7346,"If each day falls 
 inside each night, 
 there exists a well 
 where clarity is imprisoned. 

 We need to sit on the rim 
 of the well of darkness 
 and fish for fallen light 
 with patience."
7347,"Of everything I have seen, it's you I want to go on seeing: of everything I've touched, it's your flesh I want to go on touching. I love your orange laughter. I am moved by the sight of you sleeping. What am I to do, love, loved one? I don't know how others love or how people loved in the past. I live, watching you, loving you. Being in love is my nature."
7348,"I love you between shadow and soul. I love you as the plant that hasn't bloomed yet, and carries hidden within itself the light of flowers. I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. Because of you, the dense fragrance that rises from the earth lives in my body, rioting with hunger for the eternity of our victorious kisses."
7349,Only a burning patience will lead to the attainment of a splendid happiness.
7350,so I wait for you like a lonely house till you will see me again and live in me. Till then my windows ache.
7351,As if you were on fire from within. The moon lives in the lining of your skin.
7352,Laughter is the language of the soul.
7353,"I have named you queen. There are taller than you, taller. There are purer than you, purer. There are lovelier than you, lovelier. But you are the queen."
7354,Your wide eyes are the only light I know from extinguished constellations.

7359,
7360,
7361,"Learn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist."
7362,The first half of life is learning to be an adult-the second half is learning to be a child.
7363,Everything you can imagine is real.
7364,Why do you try to understand art? Do you try to understand the song of a bird?
7365,
7366,"To know what you're going to draw, you have to begin drawing."
7367,Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.
7368,
7369,"If you know exactly what you're going to do, what's the good in doing 
 it?"
7370,Go and do the things you can't. That is how you get to do them.
7371,Art is lies that tell the truth.
7372,A plagiarist steals from one person. A true artist steals from everybody.
7373,"Our goals can only be reached through a vehicle of a plan, in which we must fervently believe, and upon which we must vigorously act. There is no other route to success."
7374,"I like all paintings. I always look at the paintings, good or bad, in barbershops, furniture stores, provincial hotels. I'm like a drinker who needs wine. As long as it is wine, it doesn't matter which wine."
7375,"...why did Plato say that poets should be chased out of the republic?  Precisely because every poet and every artist is an antisocial being.  He's not that way because he wants to be; he can't be any other way.... and if he really is an artist it is in his nature not to want to be admitted, because if he is admitted it can only mean he is doing something which is understood, approved, and therefore old hat - worthless.  Anything new, anything worth doing, can't be recognized."
7376,Computers are useless - all they can give you are answers.
7377,Without great solitude no serious work is possible.

7380,Music and art are the guiding lights of the world.
7381,"...art is something subversive.  It's something that should not be free.  Art and liberty, like the fire of Prometheus, are things that one must steal, to be used against the established order."
7382,Others have seen what is and asked why. I have seen what could be and asked why not.
7383,
7384,"Don't depend on death to liberate you from your imperfections. You are exactly the same after death as you were before. Nothing changes; you only give up the body. If you are a thief or a liar or a cheater before death, you don't become an angel merely by dying. If such were possible, then let us all go and jump in the ocean now and become angels at once! Whatever you have made of yourself thus far, so will you be hereafter. And when you reincarnate, you will bring that same nature with you. To change, you have to make the effort. This world is the place to do it."
7385,Change yourself and you have done your part in changing the world
7386,"If you want to be sad, no one in the world can make you happy. But if you make up your mind to be happy, no one and nothing on earth can take that happiness from you."
7387,"Millions of people never analyze themselves. Mentally they are mechanical products of the factory of their environment, preoccupied with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, working and sleeping, and going here and there to be entertained. They don't know what or why they are seeking, nor why they never realize complete happiness and lasting satisfaction. By evading self-analysis, people go on being robots, conditioned by their environment. True self-analysis is the greatest art of progress."
7388,"The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, worry about the future, or anticipate troubles, but to live in the present moment wisely and earnestly. . . Live each moment completely and the future will take care of itself. Fully enjoy the wonder and beauty of each moment."

7397,"Mind is the creator of everything. You should therefore guide it to create only good. If you cling to a certain thought with dynamic will power, it finally assumes a tangible outward form. When you are able to employ your will always for constructive purposes, you become the controller of your destiny."
7398,"Most of the world is like a mental hospital. Some persons are sick with jealousy, others with anger, hatred, passion. They are victims of their habits and emotions. But you can make your home a place of peace."
7399,"It is not your passing thoughts or brilliant ideas so much as your plain everyday habits that control your life....Live simply. Don’t get caught in the machine of the world— it is too exacting. By the time you get what you are seeking your nerves are gone, the heart is damaged, and the bones are aching. Resolve to develop your spiritual powers more earnestly from now on. Learn the art of right living. If you have joy you have everything,so learn to be glad and contented....Have happiness now."

 the romance of divine love has begun."

7415,"You have no choices about how you lose, but you do have a choice about how you come back and prepare to win again."

7417,Great players and great teams want to be driven. They want to be pushed to the edge. They don't want to be cheated. Ordinary players and average teams want it to be easy
7418,"All of us have at least one great voice deep inside. People are products of their environment. A lucky few are born into situations in which positive messages abound. Others grow up hearing messages of fear and failure, which they must block out so the positive can be heard. But the positive and courageous voice will always emerge, somewhere, sometime, for all of us. Listen for it, and your breakthroughs will come."
7419,"The most DIFFICULT thing for individuals to do when they become part of a team is to sacrifice, it is much EASIER to be selfish."
7420,The key to success is to learn to do something right and then do it right every time.
7421,Don't let other people tell you what you want.
7422,"I've learned to keep things simple.  Look at your choices, pick the best one, then go to work with all your heart."
7423,Being a part of success is more important than being personally indispensable.
7424,Any team can be a miracle team.  The catch is that you have got to go out and work for your miracles.  Effort is what ultimately separates great teams from ordinary teams.
7425,"In every adversity, there is a seed of equivalent benefit."
7426,The true warrior understands and seizes that moment by giving an effort so intense and so intuitive that it could only be called one from the heart.
7427,Great teamwork is the only way we create the breakthroughs that define our careers.
7428,"When you're playing against a stacked deck, compete even harder."
7429,We sometimes need adversity to fathom our true depths.
7430,Am I a control freak? No. Do I believe in organization? You bet. In discipline? In being on time and making sure everything at the hotel is ready and right? Definitely. I don't control players. I try to control the environment around the players so they can flourish.
7431,Management must speak with one voice. When it doesn't management itself becomes a peripheral opponent to the team's mission.
7432,It's what you get from games you lose that is extremely important.
7433,You can only receive what you're willing to give.
7434,"Bad men cannot make good citizens. It is when a people forget God that tyrants forge their chains. A vitiated state of morals, a corrupted public conscience, is incompatible with freedom. No free government, or the blessings of liberty, can be preserved to any people but by a firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue; and by a frequent recurrence to fundamental principles."
7435,
7436,"It is when a people forget God, that tyrants forge their chains."
7437,The militia is our ultimate safety. We can have no security without it. The great object is that every man be armed.
7438,
7439,[Our Constitution] is an instrument for the people to restrain the government.
7440,"Power is the great evil with which we are contending. We have divided power between three branches of government and erected checks and balances to prevent abuse of power. However, where is the check on the power of the judiciary? If we fail to check the power of the judiciary, I predict that we will eventually live under judicial tyranny."
7441,"My most cherished possession I wish I could leave you is my faith in Jesus Christ, for with Him and nothing else you can be happy, but without Him and with all else you'll never be happy."

7443,"Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings."
7444,"It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, “Peace! Peace!” — but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!"

7446,"Are we at last brought to such humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our defense? Where is the difference between having our arms in possession and under our direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?"
7447,"I know not what others may choose but, as for me, give me liberty or give me death."
7448,Fear is the passion of slaves.
7449,Human nature will never part with power. Look for an example of a voluntary relinquishment of power from one end of the globe to another - you will find none.
7450,"Show me that age and country where the rights and liberties of the people were placed on the sole chance of their rulers being good men, without a consequent loss of liberty?"
7451,The Bible is worth all the other books which have ever been printed.
7452,"Were my soul trembling on the wing of eternity, were this hand freezing to death, were my voice choking with the last struggle, I would still, with the last gasp of that voice, implore you to remember the truth: God has given America to be free."
7453,"If you have given up your militia, and Congress shall refuse to arm them, you have lost every thing. Your existence will be precarious, because you depend on others, whose interests are not affected by your infelicity."
7454,"The officers of Congress, may come upon you now, fortified with all the terrors of paramount federal authority. Excisemen taxmen may come in multitudes; for the limitation of their numbers no man knows. They may, unless the general government be restrained ... go into your cellars and rooms, and search, ransack, and measure, everything you eat, drink, and wear."
7455,The people have a right to keep and bear arms.
7456,"Bad men cannot make good citizens. A vitiated state of morals, a corrupted public conscience are incompatible with freedom."

7463,Certain things are so important that they need to be discovered  alone.

7465,"If you are honest, people may cheat you. Be honest anyway."
7466,"But in the end all religions point to the same light. In between the light and us, sometimes there are too many rules. The light is here and there are no rules to follow this light."
7467,"In order to have faith in his own path, he does not need to prove that someone else's path is wrong."
7468,A life without a cause is a life without effect.
7469,"Our life is a constant journey, from birth to death. The landscape changes, the people change, our needs change, but the train keeps moving. Life is the train, not the station."
7470,
7471,You are not defeated when you lose. You are defeated when you quit.
7472,"We must struggle for our dreams, but when certain paths prove impossible, it would be best to save our energies in order to travel other roads."
7473,"May love fill your heart, compassion guide your mind, faith rule your soul."
7474,Never save the best for later. You don't know what tomorrow holds.

7479,"If you don't care about what people think, you already passed the first step of success."
7480,Impossible is just an opinion.
7481,"Certainly. But take this into consideration: of every ten problems we have, nine are created by our own selves - through guilt, self-punishment, self-pity. However, from time to time a great obstacle appears in our path, which was put there by God, and which is there for a reason. The reason is: to give us the opportunity to change everything, to move forwards."
7482,"Love is an act of faith, not an exchange"
7483,"Of all the ways we have found to hurt ourselves, the worse has been through love. We are always suffering because of someone who doesn't love us, or someone who has left us, or someone who won't leave us. If we are alone, it is because no one wants us."
7484,
7485,Many people lose the small joys in the hope for the big happiness.
7486,To find joy in work is to discover the fountain of youth.
7487,"Love cannot be forced, love cannot be coaxed and teased. It comes out of heaven, unasked and unsought."
7488,Exclusion is always dangerous. Inclusion is the only safety if we are to have a peaceful world.
7489,"You cannot make yourself feel something you do not feel, but you can make yourself do right in spite of your feelings."
7490,
7491,"When good people in any country cease their vigilance and struggle, then evil men prevail."

7494,"Only the brave should teach....Teaching is a vocation. It is as sacred as priesthood; as innate a desire, as inescapable as the genius which compels a great artist. If he has not the concern for humanity, the love of living creatures, the vision of the priest and the artist, he must not teach."
7495,"All things are possible until they are proved impossible - and even the impossible may only be so, as of now."
7496,"The truly creative mind in any field is no more than this: A human creature born abnormally, inhumanly sensitive. To him... a touch is a blow, a sound is a noise, a misfortune is a tragedy, a joy is an ecstasy, a friend is a lover, a lover is a god, and failure is death."

7503,Some of the biggest failures I ever had were successes.

7505,You can judge your age by the amount of pain you feel when you come in contact with a new idea.
7506,"I do not believe in a child world. It is a fantasy world. I believe the child should be taught from the very first that the whole world is his world, that adult and child share one world, that all generations are needed."
7507,It is good to know our universe. What is new is only new to us.
7508,A foreigner is a friend I have yet to meet.

7513,There is always someone out there getting better than you by training harder than you.
7514,"Great teams are not made up of many well-rounded players. Great teams are made up of a variety of players, each having their own strengths."
7515,A team is not made up of isolated individuals. Always stay in the game. Don't be passive. Football is a team game. No one plays alone. Success depends on your whole team being a single unit.
7516,
7517,"A lot of people, when a guy scores a lot of goals, think, 'He's a great player', because a goal is very important, but a great player is a player who can do everything on the field. He can do assists, encourage his colleagues, give them confidence to go forward. It is someone who, when a team does not do well, becomes one of the leaders."
7518,The head talks to the heart and the heart talks to the feet.
7519,"I love people. I wanted to be with the people. I wanted to give something back what I get from football, because God gave everything to me."

7526,"Everything on earth is a game. A passing thing. We all end up dead. We all end up the same, don't we?"
7527,"Football is like a religion to me. I worship the ball, and I treat it like a god. Too many players think of a football as something to kick. They should be taught to caress it and to treat it like a precious gem."
7528,Enthusiasm is everything. It must be taut and vibrating like a guitar string.
7529,"I think the kids always they look forward to be always the big stars. Not only football, any profession. They want to be the best, singer, they want to be the best political, only the stars. But I think sometime the life give you opportunity, and long to be a big star, but you don't need to be a big star, you need to be beautiful, excellent man. Human being. This is the first."
7530,I want to do my best to make the people happy. I play with my heart for the sport.

7532,When you control the ball you control the score
7533,"When you play against dirty players or very tough players, it's easy to escape because you know what they're going to do. But when the player is tough but intelligent, it's much more difficult."
7534,
7535,It's a transformative experience to simply pause instead of immediately filling up space.
7536,Loving kindness towards ourselves doesn't mean getting rid of anything. It means we can still be crazy after all these years. We can still be angry after all these years. We can still be timid or jealous or full of feelings of unworthiness. The point is not to try to throw ourselves away and become something better. It's about befriending who we are already.
7537,Be kinder to yourself. And then let your kindness flood the world.
7538,You are the sky. Everything else - it’s just the weather.
7539,"The next time you lose heart and you can’t bear to experience what you’re feeling, you might recall this instruction: change the way you see it and lean in. Instead of blaming our discomfort on outer circumstances or on our own weakness, we can choose to stay present and awake to our experience, not rejecting it, not grasping it, not buying the stories that we relentlessly tell ourselves. This is priceless advice that addresses the true cause of suffering—yours, mine, and that of all living beings."
7540,Let your curiosity be greater than your fear.
7541,"Not causing harm requires staying awake. Part of being awake is slowing down enough to notice what we say and do. The more we witness our emotional chain reactions and understand how they work, the easier it is to refrain. It becomes a way of life to stay awake, slow down, and notice."
7542,"I can't overestimate the importance of accepting ourselves exactly as we are right now, not as we wish we were or think we ought to be."
7543,All you need to know is that the future is wide open and you are about to create it by what you do.
7544,"Times are difficult globally; awakening is no longer a luxury or an ideal. It’s becoming critical. We don’t need to add more depression, more discouragement, or more anger to what’s already here. It’s becoming essential that we learn how to relate sanely with difficult times. The earth seems to be beseeching us to connect with joy and discover our innermost essence. This is the best way that we can benefit others."
7545,It isn't what happens to us that causes us to suffer; it's what we say to ourselves about what happens.
7546,One of the deepest habitual patterns that we have is to feel that now is not enough.
7547,"Each time you stay present with fear and uncertainty, you're letting go of a habitual way of finding security and comfort."
7548,"Difficult things provoke all your irritations and bring your habitual patterns to the surface.  And that becomes the moment of truth.  You have the choice to launch into your lousy habitual patterns, or to stay with the rawness and discomfort of the situation and let it transform you."
7549,"What you do for yourself, any gesture of kindness, any gesture of gentleness, any gesture of honesty and clear seeing toward yourself, will affect how you experience your world. In fact, it will transform how you experience the world. What you do for yourself, you’re doing for others, and what you do for others, you’re doing for yourself."
7550,"Deep down in the human spirit, there is a reservoir of courage. It is always available, always waiting to be discovered."
7551,"This moving away from comfort and security, this stepping out into what is unknown, uncharted and shaky - that's called liberation."

7557,"Whatever happens in your life, joyful or painful, do not be swept away by reactivity. Be patient with yourself and don't lose your sense of perspective."

7559,
7560,Songs are funny things. They can slip across borders. Proliferate in prisons. Penetrate hard shells. I always believed that the right song at the right moment could change history.
7561,It's a very important thing to learn to talk to people you disagree with.
7562,Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't.
7563,"And when one person taps out a beat, while another leads into the melody, or when three people discover a harmony they never knew existed, or a crowd joins in on a chorus as though to raise the ceiling a few feet higher, then they also know there is hope for the world."

7568,The first step in solving a problem is admitting there is a problem to be solved.
7569,"I feel most spiritual when I'm out in the woods. I feel part of nature. Or looking up at the stars. [I used to say] I was an atheist. Now I say, it's all according to your definition of God. According to my definition of God, I'm not an atheist. Because I think God is everything. Whenever I open my eyes I'm looking at God."
7570,"I tell kids, don't trust the media. The media with their emphasis on fame is helping to destroy this country, helping destroy the human race. It's the plug-in drug."
7571,"If there's a world here in a hundred years, it's going to be saved by tens of millions of little things.  The powers-that-be can break up any big thing they want.  They can corrupt it or co-opt it from the inside, or they can attack it from the outside.  But what are they going to do about 10 million little things?  They break up two of them, and three more like them spring up!"
7572,"Shh. Listen to the sounds that surround you. Notice the pitches, the volume, the timbre, the many lines of counterpoint. As light taught Monet to paint, the earth may be teaching you music."
7573,"Every time I'm in the woods, i feel like I'm in church."
7574,The easiest way to avoid wrong notes is to never open your mouth and sing. What a mistake that would be.

7578,"I still call myself a communist, because communism is no more what Russia made of it than Christianity is what the churches make of it."
7579,"And there's a wonderful parable in the New Testament: The sower scatters seeds. Some seeds fall in the pathway and get stamped on, and they don't grow. Some fall on the rocks, and they don't grow. But some seeds fall on fallow ground, and they grow and multiply a thousandfold. Who knows where some good little thing that you've done may bring results years later that you never dreamed of?"

7596,There is nothing worse than doing the wrong thing well.
7597,"The leaders who work most effectively, it seems to me, never say ""I."" And that's not because they have trained themselves not to say ""I."" They don't think ""I."" They think ""we""; they think ""team."" They understand their job to be to make the team function. They accept responsibility and don't sidestep it, but ""we"" gets the credit. This is what creates trust, what enables you to get the task done."
7598,Doing the right thing is more important than doing the thing right.
7599,Most leaders don't need to learn what to do. They need to learn what to stop.

7607,"One cannot buy, rent or hire more time. The supply of time is totally inelastic. No matter how high the demand, the supply will not go up. There is no price for it. Time is totally perishable and cannot be stored. Yesterday's time is gone forever, and will never come back. Time is always in short supply. There is no substitute for time. Everything requires time. All work takes place in, and uses up time. Yet most people take for granted this unique, irreplaceable and necessary resource."
7608,The only real difference between one organization and another is the performance of its people.
7609,
7610,

He knows the shoals and the sand banks, the rocks and the reefs, He will steer you safely into that celestial harbor where your anchor will be cast for eternity.

7619,Most of us know perfectly well what we ought to do; our trouble is that we do not want to do it.
7620,"No tabloid will ever print the startling news that the mummified body of Jesus of Nazareth has been discovered in old Jerusalem.

We all believe in the God of the heroic. What we need most these days is the God of the humdrum, the commonplace, the everyday."
7624,"Above all, we should question the consumer ethic, which uses up non-renewable resources, creates inequality and injustice, generates pollution, destroys other species and upsets the balance of nature. The consumer ethic not only defiles the environment by creating undesirable change in the biosphere but also corrupts the mind and body by defining pleasure in terms of ownership and absorption. Waste itself is a human concept; everything in nature is eventually used. If human beings carry on in their present ways, they will one day be recycled along with the dinosaurs."
7625,It is better to fail in a cause that will ultimately succeed than to succeed in a cause that will ultimately fail.
7626,"God hasn't given up on you. He can still do great things for you, in you, and through you. God is ready and waiting and able. What about you, and me?"
7627,The proof of how real Jesus knew hell to be is that He came to earth to save us from it.
7628,"We pray Thee, O Christ, to keep us under the spell of immortality. My we never again think and act as if Thou were dead. Let us more and more come to know Thee as a living Lord who hath promised to them that believe: ""Because I live, ye shall live also."" Help us to remember that we are praying to the Conqueror of Death, that we may no longer be afraid nor dismayed by the world's problems and threats, since Thou hast overcome the world. In Thy strong name, we ask for Thy living presence and Thy victorious power. Amen."
7629,"The modern challenge to motherhood is the eternal challenge--that of being a godly woman. The very phrase sounds strange in our ears. We never hear it now. We hear about every other type of women: beautiful women, smart women, sophisticated women, career women, talented women, divorced women. But so seldom to we hear of a godly woman--or of a godly man either, for that matter. I believe women come nearer to fulfilling their God-given function in the home than anywhere else."

7631,Give according to your income lest God make your income according to your giving.

7634,
7635,"Two of the central ingredients to our family are food and faith, so sitting down together and thanking God for the food He's provided means everything to us. Prayer is a natural part of our lives - not only around the dinner table but all day long."

7641,Jesus Christ was the most perfect being to ever walk this planet and he was persecuted and nailed to the cross … so please don’t be surprised when we get a little static.
7642,"I myself am a product of the 60s; I centered my life around sex, drugs and rock and roll until I hit rock bottom and accepted Jesus as my Savior. My mission today is to go forth and tell people about why I follow Christ and also what the Bible teaches, and part of that teaching is that women and men are meant to be together. However, I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me. We are all created by the Almighty and like Him, I love all of humanity. We would all be better off if we loved God and loved each other."
7643,I guess the GOP may be more desperate than I thought to call somebody like me.
7644,"If you provide the drive, dream, and vision, with God’s help, you can accomplish anything."

7649,"We never, ever judge someone on who's going to heaven, hell. That's the Almighty's job."
7650,"Everything is blurred on what's right and what's wrong ... Sin becomes fine. Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men. Don't be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers - they won't inherit the kingdom of God."

I'm with the blacks, because we're white trash. We're going across the field.... They're singing and happy.

7968,"Mainstream people dislike homosexuality because they can't help concentrating on what homosexual men do to one another. And when you contemplate what people do, you think of yourself doing it.

7969,I lost the love of all the homosexuals in the world by saying that Princess Diana was trash and got what she deserved. She could have been Queen of England - and she was swanning about Paris with Arabs. What disgraceful behavior. Going about saying she wanted to be the queen of hearts.

So, I became a prototype of the effeminate man, because I was conspicuously effeminate. But camp is not something I do, it's something I am."
7974,The trouble with children is that they're not returnable.
7975,To live in the past is to miss today's opportunities and tomorrow's blessings.

7991,Some build their sense of personal worth by comparing themselves to others. That approach can lead to feelings of inadequacy or superiority. It is preferable to look directly to our Father for our sense of self-worth.
7992,Live by faith and not by fear.
7993,"Our women are not incredible because they have managed to avoid the difficulties of life—quite the opposite. They are incredible because of the way they face the trials of life. Despite the challenges and tests life has to offer—from marriage or lack of marriage, children’s choices, poor health, lack of opportunities, and many other problems—they remain remarkably strong and immovable and true to the faith.

8016,The good ideas will survive.
8017,"I steal from every single movie ever made. I love it - if my work has anything it's that I'm taking this from this and that from that and mixing them together. If people don't like that, then tough titty, don't go and see it, all right? I steal from everything. Great artists steal; they don't do homages."

8026,"Music is very, very important in my movies. In some ways the most important stage, whether it ends up being in the movie or not, is just when I come up with the idea itself before I have actually sat down and started writing. I go into my record room... I have a big vinyl collection and I have a room kind of set up like a used record store and I just dive into my music, whether it be rock music, or lyric music, or my soundtrack collection. What I'm looking for is the spirit of the movie, the beat that the movie will play with."

I didnt have to search for answers. The answers lay no further than the bell of my trumpet and my scrawled, pencilled scores. Music made me full, strong, popular, self-reliant and cool."

8049,"There’s nothing in the world worse than having an opportunity that you’re not prepared for. Good luck usually follows the collision of opportunity and preparation - it’s a result of that collision. You’ve got to be prepared. So, make your mistakes now and make them quickly.

8060,"Most of the homeschooled children I know have about the same amount of after-school peer time as the rest of the population but, obviously, without that school day together, they do spend less time with their peers. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing is still open to debate."
8061,"All the homeschooling parents I know meet on a regular basis with other families. They organize field trips, cooking classes, reading clubs and Scout troops. Their children tend to be happy, confident and socially engaged."
8062,"The process of socialization is nowhere near complete at age five or six, when modern children start spending up to half their waking hours taking their cues from other people's children.

8164,"You've been somebody long enough. You spent the first half of your life becoming somebody. Now you can work on becoming nobody, which is really somebody. For when you become nobody there is no tension, no pretense, no one trying to be anyone or anything. The natural state of the mind shines through unobstructed - and the natural state of the mind is pure love."
8165,"Watch how your mind judges. Judgment comes, in part, out of your own fear. You judge other people because you're not comfortable in your own being. By judging, you find out where you stand in relation to other people. The judging mind is very divisive. It separates. Separation closes your heart. If you close your heart to someone, you are perpetuating your suffering and theirs. Shifting out of judgment means learning to appreciate your predicament and their predicament with an open heart instead of judging. Then you can allow yourself and others to just be, without separation."
8166,"Our journey is about being more deeply involved in life, and yet less attached to it."

8169,Don’t compare your path with anybody else’s. Your path is unique to you.
8170,Witness your thoughts. Your thoughts are attachments.
8171,"Souls love. That’s what souls do. Egos don’t, but souls do. Become a soul, look around, and you’ll be amazed-all the beings around you are souls. Be one, see one. When many people have this heart connection, then we will know that we are all one, we human beings all over the planet. We will be one. One love. And don’t leave out the animals, and trees, and clouds, and galaxies-it’s all one. It’s one energy."
8172,Be patient. You'll know when it's time for you to wake up and move ahead.
8173,Nature is really important because it's a manifestation of love that hasn't been run through human minds.
8174,Treat everyone you meet like God in drag.
8175,"The final awakening is the embracing of the darkness into the light. That means embracing our humanity as well as our divinity. What we go from is being born into our humanity, sleep walking for a long time, until we awaken and start to taste our divinity. And then want to finally get free. 
 We see as long as we grab at our divinity and push away our humanity we aren’t free. If you want to be free, you can’t push away anything. You have to embrace it all. It’s all God."

8178,The resistance to the unpleasant situation is the root of suffering.
8179,"The dark night of the soul is when you have lost the flavor of life but have not yet gained the fullness of divinity. So it is that we must weather that dark time, the period of transformation when what is familiar has been taken away and the new richness is not yet ours."
8180,"I would like my life to be a statement of love and compassion--and where it isn't, that's where my work lies."
8181,"The heart surrenders everything to the moment. The mind judges and holds back. 

 In most of our human relationships, we spend much of our time reassuring one another that our costumes of identity are on straight. 

 When we see the Beloved in each person, it's like walking through a garden, watching flowers bloom all around us."
8182,"This is the pathless path - returning to where you were initially before you got lost. The deepest truth in you is where the journey leads - shedding, like taking off layers of an onion, until you come to your essence. The key to the spiritual journey is not acquiring something outside of yourself. Rather it is shedding the veils to come back to the deepest truth of your being."
8183,"It's very hard to grow, because it's difficult to let go of the models of ourselves in which we've invested so heavily."
8184,All spiritual practices are illusions created by illusionists to escape illusion.
8185,Information is just bits of data. Knowledge is putting them together. Wisdom is transcending them.
8186,One of the ego's favorite paths of resistance is to fill you with doubt.
8187,Every religion is the product of the conceptual mind attempting to describe the mystery.
8188,
8189,"I'm interested in having fun with ideas, throwing them up in the air like confetti and then running under them."
8190,"I hate all politics. I don't like either political party. One should not belong to them - one should be an individual, standing in the middle. Anyone that belongs to a party stops thinking."
8191,You don't have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them.
8192,
8193,Life is about trying things to see if they work.
8194,"The television, that insidious beast, that Medusa which freezes a billion people to stone every night, staring fixedly, that Siren which called and sang and promised so much and gave, after all, so little."

8196,You have to learn to take rejection not as an indication of personal failing but as a wrong address.
8197,"Looking back over a lifetime, you see that love was the answer to everything."

8200,"Treasure this day and Treasure yourself, truly, neither will ever happen again."
8201,Sometimes I think I understand everything. Then I regain consciousness
8202,"I spent three days a week for 10 years educating myself in the public library, and it's better than college. People should educate themselves - you can get a complete education for no money. At the end of 10 years, I had read every book in the library and I'd written a thousand stories."
8203,Love is the answer to everything. It's the only reason to do anything.

8211,"If you stuff yourself full of poems, essays, plays, stories, novels, films, comic strips, magazines, music, you automatically explode every morning like Old Faithful. I have never had a dry spell in my life, mainly because I feed myself well, to the point of bursting. I wake early and hear my morning voices leaping around in my head like jumping beans. I get out of bed to trap them before they escape."
8212,A book is a loaded gun.

 To change your world all you have to do is manage your thoughts and feelings on the inside of you, and then your whole world changes."
8218,"Never let a day pass without looking for the good, feeling the good within you, praising, appreciating, blessing, and being grateful. Make it your life commitment, and you will stand in utter awe of what happens in your life."

8226,"Do not worry at all about negative thoughts, and do not try to control them. All you have to do is begin to think good thoughts each day. Plant as many good thoughts as you can in each day. As you begin to think good thoughts you will attract more and more good thoughts, and eventually the good thoughts will wipe out the negative thoughts altogether."
8227,"Be aware of everything around you, because you are receiving the answers to your questions in every moment of the day."
8228,What you are thinking now is creating your future life.

8231,"You are a genius beyond description, so start telling yourself that and become aware of who you really are."
8232,"No matter who you are, no matter where you are, no matter what your circumstances or desires, if you make a gratitude list every day of the things you’re grateful for, you will see your life take off! GRATITUDE is your MAGIC WAND! Whatever you point gratitude at increases, expands, and escalates, but you have to pick up that magic wand, and use it! Got it?"
8233,"The purpose of life is joy! When you're in joy, you attract the highest and best in every area of your life. Joy increases to the exact degree that you deliberately increase your good thoughts, good words, and good actions. I've found in my life that the easiest way to increase my joy is to religiously practice gratitude until I'm a gratitude machine!"

8237,"There are two words that, when spoken, have the most unfathomable power to completely change your life. Two words which, when they pass your lips, will be the cause of bringing absolute joy and happiness to you. Two words that will create miracles in your life. Two words that will wipe out negativity. Two words that will bring you abundance in all things. Two words which, when uttered and sincerely felt, will summon all the forces and vibrations in the Universe to move all things for you. The only thing standing between you, happiness, and the life of your dreams is two words THANK YOU!"
8238,
8239,Every real teacher is myself in disguise.
8240,"Have you ever felt so at one with the world, with the universe, with everything that is, that you were overcome with love? That is reality. That is the truth. What we make of it is up to us, as the painting of the sunrise is up to the artist. In our world humanity has strayed from that love. It lives hatred and power struggles and manipulations of the earth itself for its own narrow reasons. Continue and no one will see the sunrise. The sunrise will always exist, of course, but people on earth will know nothing of it and finally even stories of its beauty will fade from our knowing."
8241,"Everything of this life as a mortal is fiction. It seems real, but..."
8242,Why? What is so wonderful about mass murder that nobody in the history of the world has ever fond any smarter solution to problems than killing everybody who doesn’t agree? Is that the limit of human intelligence?
8243,No one does anything uncharacteristic of who they are.
8244,Not being known doesn't stop the truth from being true.
8245,All of us are called by something in this world that attracts us. And it doesn't matter what it is - you can be an engine mechanic or an aviator or you can be someone who loves their flower garden or the world of commerce or sailboats.
8246,"In order to win, you must expect to win."
8247,Thought plus belief equals manifestation.
8248,"When we put up with any situation we don’t have to put up with, it’s not because we’re dumb. We put up with it, because we want the lesson only that situation can teach, and we want it more than freedom myself."
8249,"How can we resent the life we've created for ourselves? Who's to blame, who's to credit, but us? Who can change it, any time we wish, but us?"
8250,"Allow the world to live as it chooses, and allow yourself to live as you choose."
8251,"We design our lives through the power of our choices. We feel most helpless when we've made choices by default, when we haven't designed our lives on our own."
8252,"To fly as fast as thought, to anywhere that is, you must begin by knowing that you have already arrived."
8253,Boredom between two people doesn't come from being together physically. It comes from being apart mentally and spiritually.

8255,Hate is love without enough data.
8256,"We choose our next world through what we learn in this one. Learn nothing, and the next world is the same as this one, all the same limitations and lead weights to overcome."
8257,How can a deer tell when a leaf falls silent in the forest? She hears it breathing differently.
8258,We magnetize into our lives whatever we hold in our thought.
8259,You're never given a dream without the power to make it true.
8260,Mistakes - call them unexpected learning experiences.
8261,"A soulmate is someone who has locks that fit our keys, and keys to fit our locks. When we feel safe enough to open the locks, our truest selves step out and we can be completely and honestly who we are; we can be loved for who we are and not for who we're pretending to be. Each unveils the best part of the other. No matter what else goes wrong around us, with that one person we're safe in our own paradise."
8262,Your conscience is the measure of the honesty of your selfishness. Listen to it carefully.
8263,
8264,
8265,"If somebody offers you an amazing opportunity but you are not sure you can do it, say yes-then learn how to do it later!"
8266,Listen more than you talk. Nobody learned anything by hearing themselves speak.
8267,"If people are crazy enough to dare, impossible things happen."
8268,"Every success story is a tale of constant adaption, revision and change."
8269,
8270,"If people aren't calling you crazy, you aren't thinking big enough."
8271,Your employees are your company’s real competitive advantage. They’re the ones making the magic happen-so long as their needs are being met.
8272,"Success cannot be measured in wealth, fame or power, but by whether you have made a positive difference for others."

8276,

8278,Confidence breeds confidence and negativity breeds negativity. Treat those around you with respect and dignity and they will thrive.

 Think yes not no. 
 Live life to the full. 
 Never give up."

8283,The best way of learning about anything is by doing.
8284,"If you aim higher than you expect, you could reach higher than you dreamed."
8285,"Colleagues should take care of each other, have fun, celebrate success, learn by failure, look for reasons to praise not to criticize, communicate freely and respect each other."
8286,Tough times are inevitable in life and in business. But how you compose yourself during those times defines your spirit and will define your future.

8288,
8289,You can't grow strong without resistance.
8290,"If you always feel comfortable reading God's Word, you're either not reading ALL of it, or you aren't letting it sink in."
8291,You are loved by the One who knows you best. God's love will never disappoint you and never give up on you.
8292,The ultimate test of faith is not how loudly you praise God in happy times but how deeply you trust him in dark times.
8293,"Great opportunities may come once in a lifetime, but small opportunities surround us every day."
8294,Your wisest moments will be those when you say yes to God.
8295,"When pressure builds up, don't panic. Pray! Prayer is a tremendous stress reliever. It can be your safety valve."
8296,"A lie doesn't become truth, wrong doesn't become right and evil doesn't become good, just because it's accepted by a majority."
8297,"When you give someone your time, you are giving them a portion of your life that you'll never get back.Your time is your life. That is why the greatest gift you can give someone is your time"

8301,The first step to becoming what God made you to be is to stop worrying about what others want you to be.
8302,Living by faith isn't living with certainty. It's trusting God in spite of unanswered questions and unresolved doubts.
8303,Life is a school and problems are the curriculum.

8323,
8324,Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
8325,"Don't be afraid to be yourself just because you're not like everybody else in class.

8336,I am never satisfied; I always want more. I always want to get better. I always want to climb another step.

8338,
8339,
8340,

8349,There is no place I know that compares to pure imagination.
8350,"I began to realize how important it was to be an enthusiast in life. He taught me that if you are interested in something, no matter what it is, go at it at full speed ahead. Embrace it with both arms, hug it, love it and above all become passionate about it. Lukewarm is no good. Hot is no good either. White hot and passionate is the only thing to be"

8354,You'll never get anywhere if you go about what-iffing like that.
8355,"I was glad my father was an eye-smiler. It meant he never gave me a fake smile, because it's impossible to make your eyes twinkle if you aren't feeling twinkly yourself. A mouth-smile is different. You can fake a mouth-smile any time you want, simply by moving your lips. I've also learned that a real mouth-smile always has an eye-smile to go with it, so watch out, I say, when someone smiles at you with his mouth but the eyes stay the same. It's sure to be bogus."

8362,"No book ever ends, when it's full of your friends."
8363,"Secrecy is the keystone to all tyranny. Not force, but secrecy and censorship. When any government or church for that matter, undertakes to say to its subjects, ""This you may not read, this you must not know,"" the end result is tyranny and oppression, no matter how holy the motives. Mighty little force is needed to control a man who has been hoodwinked in this fashion; contrariwise, no amount of force can control a free man, whose mind is free. No, not the rack nor the atomic bomb, not anything. You can't conquer a free man; the most you can do is kill him."
8364,"A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects."
8365,"[T]here seems to have been an actual decline in rational thinking. The United States had become a place where entertainers and professional athletes were mistaken for people of importance. They were idolized and treated as leaders; their opinions were sought on everything and they took themselves just as seriously-after all, if an athlete is paid a million or more a year, he knows he is important ... so his opinions of foreign affairs and domestic policies must be important, too, even though he proves himself to be ignorant and subliterate every time he opens his mouth."
8366,You can sway a thousand men by appealing to their prejudices quicker than you can convince one man by logic.
8367,"It is a bad sign when the people of a country stop identifying themselves with the country and start identifying with a group. A racial group. Or a religion. Or a language. Anything, as long as it isn't the whole population."
8368,"I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do."
8369,"Political tags - such as royalist, communist, democrat, populist, fascist, liberal, conservative, and so forth - are never basic criteria. The human race divides politically into those who want people to be controlled and those who have no such desire."
8370,"Love your country, but never trust its government."
8371,Democracy can survive anything except Democrats
8372,"Ignorance is curable, stupid is forever."
8373,"A dying culture invariably exhibits personal rudeness. Bad manners. Lack of consideration for others in minor matters. A loss of politeness, of gentle manners, is more significant than is a riot."
8374,Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity. Never underestimate the power of human stupidity.
8375,The lessons of history teach us - if the lessons of history teach us anything - that nobody learns the lessons that history teaches us.
8376,"Patriotism is not 'my country right or wrong'; patriotism means loving the ideals for which America stands and having the courage to speak up when these ideals are distorted for personal or political gain. The American government was instituted to be the servant of the people, not our master."
8377,No statement should be believed because it is made by an authority.
8378,"At least once every human should have to run for his life, to teach him that milk does not come from supermarkets, that safety does not come from policemen, that 'news' is not something that happens to other people. He might learn how his ancestors lived and that he himself is no different--in the crunch his life depends on his agility, alertness, and personal resourcefulness."
8379,"Anyone who clings to the historically untrue-and thoroughly immoral-doctrine that, 'violence never settles anything' I would advise to conjure the ghosts of Napoleon Bonaparte and the Duke of Wellington and let them debate it. The ghost of Hitler could referee, and the jury might well be the Dodo, the Great Auk and the Passenger Pigeon. Violence, naked force, has settled more issues in history than has any other factor, and the contrary opinion is wishful thinking at its worst. Breeds that forget this basic truth have always paid for it with their lives and freedom."
8380,There are no dangerous weapons; there are only dangerous men.
8381,Never underestimate the power of human stupidity.
8382,Progress isn't made by early risers. It's made by lazy men trying to find easier ways to do something.

8386,"A fool cannot be protected from his folly. If you attempt to do so, you will not only arouse his animosity but also you will be attempting to deprive him of whatever benefit he is capable of deriving from experience. Never attempt to teach a pig to sing; it wastes your time and annoys the pig."
8387,"The police of a state should never be stronger or better armed than the citizenry. An armed citizenry, willing to fight, is the foundation of civil freedom. That's a personal evaluation, of course."

8417,You know how many seeds are in an apple. But you don't know how many apples are in a seed.
8418,Impossible situations can become possible miracles.
8419,"In difficult times, people too often lose the ability to face the future optimistically. They begin to think about their tomorrow's negatively. They forget that the tough times will pass. They concentrate on the problems of today rather than on the opportunities of tomorrow. In so doing, they not only lose the potential of today, they also throw away the beauty of tomorrow."
8420,"Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future."
8421,"If you listen to your fears, you will die never knowing what a great person you might have been."
8422,"When faced with a mountain, I WILL NOT QUIT! I will keep on striving until I climb over, find a pass through, tunnel underneath, or simply stay and turn the mountain into a gold mine with God's help!"
8423,Faith is reacting positively to a negative situation.
8424,The good news is that the bad news can be turned into good news when you change your attitude.
8425,"Again and again, the impossible problem is solved when we see that the problem is only a tough decision waiting to be made."
8426,I'd rather attempt to do something great and fail than to attempt to do nothing and succeed.
8427,"Lord, make my life A window for Your light To shine through And a mirror to reflect Your love To all I meet. Amen."
8428,I see the invisible. I believe the incredible. I attempt the impossible.
8429,"Never sell tomorrow short. There's plenty to get excited about. Be filled with expectation, hope and confidence. Believe something good is going to happen - and it usually will."
8430,The truth of the matter is that you always know the right thing to do. The hard part is doing it.
8431,"If you are creative enough to imagine a problem, you're clever enough to discover a solution."
8432,God's delays are not God's denials.
8433,Every problem has a limited life span.
8434,I will! I am! I can! I will actualize my dream. I will press ahead. I will settle down and see it through. I will solve the problems. I will pay the price. I will never walk away from my dream until I see my dream walk away: Alert! Alive! Achieved!
8435,When you are in your worst moods. Wait. Be patient. The storm will pass. The spring will come
8436,The only place where your dream becomes impossible is in your own thinking.
8437,"Problems are guidelines, not stop signs!"

8441,You won't learn if you think you already know everything.
8442,"Inside each of you is a rich person, a poor person & a middle class person. It is up to you to decide which person you become."
8443,The main reason people struggle financially is because they have spent years in school but learned nothing about money. The result is that people learn to work for money...but never learn to have money work for them.
8444,"Before you invest in something, invest the time to understand it"
8445,The philosophy of the rich and the poor is this: the rich invest their money and spend what is left. The poor spend their money and invest what is left.
8446,Great opportunities are not seen with your eyes. They are seen with your mind.

8449,"Action first, mistakes second, lessons third."
8450,"Remember, your mind is your greatest asset, so be careful what you put into it."

8452,Losers quit when they fail. Winners fail until they succeed.

8461,People don't like the idea of thinking long term. Many are desperately seeking short term answers because they have money problems to be solved today.
8462,"If you want to be rich, be friends with people who have the same mindset as you, or who at least won't try to change your mindset to be more like theirs. Life is too short to spend time with people who don't help you move forward."

8507,I have learnt to be even more patient.

8509,"Previously I always thought it was just tactical and technique, but every match has become almost mental and physical - I try to push myself to move well. I try to push myself not to get upset and stay positive, and that's what my biggest improvement is over all those years. Under pressure I can see things very clear."
8510,"I enjoyed the position I was in as a tennis player. I was to blame when I lost. I was to blame when I won. And I really like that, because I played soccer a lot too, and I couldn't stand it when I had to blame it on the goalkeeper."
8511,You can be stubborn and successful or you can give it up a bit and change things around. For me it's important to have a bit of both.

8513,
8514,
8515,"No single person, including the President of the United States, should ever be given the power to make a medical decision for potentially millions of Americans. Freedom over one's physical person is the most basic freedom of all, and people in a free society should be sovereign over their own bodies. When we give government the power to make medical decisions for us, we in essence accept that the state owns our bodies."
8516,One thing is clear: The Founding Fathers never intended a nation where citizens would pay nearly half of everything they earn to the government.
8517,"In a free society, we are supposed to know the truth. In a society where truth becomes treason, we are in big trouble."
8518,It is a dangerous notion that we need a government to protect us from ourselves.
8519,"Freedom is not defined by safety. Freedom is defined by the ability of citizens to live without government interference. Government cannot create a world without risks, nor would we really wish to live in such a fictional place. Only a totalitarian society would even claim absolute safety as a worthy ideal, because it would require total state control over its citizens’ lives. Liberty has meaning only if we still believe in it when terrible things happen and a false government security blanket beckons."
8520,
8521,
8522,"If we stuck to the Constitution as written, we would have:  no federal meddling in our schools;  no Federal Reserve;  no U.S. membership in the UN;  no gun control;  and no foreign aid.  We would have no welfare for big corporations, or the ""poor"";   no American troops in 100 foreign countries;  no NAFTA, GAT, or ""fast-track"";  no arrogant federal judges usurping states rights;  no attacks on private property;  no income tax.  We could get rid of most of the agencies, and most of the budget.  The government would be small, frugal, and limited."
8523,"The problem is that democracy is not freedom. Democracy is simply majoritarianism, which is inherently incompatible with real freedom. Our founding fathers clearly understood this."
8524,The Founders warned that a free society depends on a virtuous and moral people. The current crisis reflects that their concerns were justified.
8525,"The most sinister of all taxes is the inflation tax and it is the most regressive. It hits the poor and the middle class. When you destroy a currency by creating money out of thin air to pay the bills, the value of the dollar goes down, and people get hit with a higher cost of living. It's the middle class that's being wiped out. It is most evil of all taxes."
8526,The Federal Reserve System is nothing more than legalized counterfeit.
8527,"Why is patriotism thought to be blind loyalty to the government and the politicians who run it, rather than loyalty to the principles of liberty and support for the people? Real patriotism is a willingness to challenge the government when it's wrong."
8528,"The moral and constitutional obligations of our representatives in Washington are to protect our liberty, not coddle the world, precipitating no-win wars, while bringing bankruptcy and economic turmoil to our people."
8529,Don't steal - the government hates competition!
8530,We don't have the freedom of speech to talk about the weather. We have the first amendment so we can say some very controversial things.

8532,The original American patriots were those individuals brave enough to resist with force the oppressive power of King George... Patriotism is more closely linked to dissent than it is to conformity and a blind desire for safety and security.
8533,"If you sacrifice liberty for security, you will lose both."
8534,It is no coincidence that the century of total war coincided with the century of central banking.
8535,The federal government cannot maintain a budget surplus any more than an alcoholic can leave a fresh bottle of whiskey untouched in the cupboard.
8536,"Libertarians are incapable of being a racist, because racism is a collectivist idea."
8537,"Speak up, speak often and don’t worry about those that at this point cannot understand as they can never un-hear what we tell them."
8538,
8539,
8540,
8541,"Government is not a solution to our problem, government is the problem. ... Government does not solve problems; it subsidizes them. Government's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. If it stops moving, subsidize it. ... The problem is not that people are taxed too little, the problem is that government spends too much."
8542,"Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same."

8544,
8545,"The nine most terrifying words in the English language are ""I'm from the government, and I'm here to help."""
8546,"We must never remain silent in the face of bigotry. We must condemn those who seek to divide us. In all quarters and at all times, we must teach tolerance and denounce racism, anti-Semitism and all ethnic or religious bigotry wherever they exist as unacceptable evils. We have no place for haters in America -- none, whatsoever."
8547,"It's not that liberals aren't smart, it's just that so much of what they know isn't so"
8548,"When a business or an individual spends more than it makes, it goes bankrupt. When government does it, it sends you the bill. And when government does it for 40 years, the bill comes in two ways: higher taxes and inflation. Make no mistake about it, inflation is a tax and not by accident."
8549,A nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation.
8550,"We must reject the idea that every time a law's broken, society is guilty rather than the lawbreaker. It is time to restore the American precept that each individual is accountable for his actions."
8551,The greatest leader is not necessarily the one who does the greatest things. He is the one that gets the people to do the greatest things.
8552,"Now back in 1927 an American socialist, Norman Thomas, six times candidate for president on the Socialist Party ticket, said the American people would never vote for socialism. But he said under the name of liberalism the American people will adopt every fragment of the socialist program."
8553,"If we lose freedom here, there is no place to escape to. This is the last stand on earth."
8554,I've noticed that everyone who is for abortion has already been born.
8555,"Freedom is a fragile thing and is never more than one generation away from extinction. It is not ours by inheritance; it must be fought for and defended constantly by each generation, for it comes only once to a people. Those who have known freedom, and then lost it, have never known it again."
8556,One of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a people has been by way of medicine.
8557,The most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
8558,Evil is powerless if the good are unafraid.
8559,"If more government is the answer, then it was a really stupid question."
8560,"We could say the government spend like drunken sailors, but that would be unfair to drunken sailors, because the sailors are spending their own money."
8561,Almost all the worlds' constitutions are documents in which governments tell the people what their privileges are. Our Constitution is a document in which We the People tell the government what it is allowed to do. We the People are free.
8562,"Because you won't get gun control by disarming law abiding citizens. There's only one way to get real gun control: Disarm the thugs and the criminals, lock them up, and if you don't actually throw away the key, at least lose it for a long time."
8563,
8564,"The Inspiration You Seek 
 Is Already Within You. 
 Be Silent And Listen."

8569,
8570,"When I run after what I think I want, my days are a furnace of stress and anxiety; if I sit in my own place of patience, what I need flows to me, and without pain. From this I understand that what I want also wants me, is looking for me and attracting me. There is a great secret here for anyone who can grasp it."
8571,Try not to resist the changes that come your way. Instead let life live through you. And do not worry that your life is turning upside down. How do you know that the side you are used to is better than the one to come?

8580,The desire to know your own soul will end all other desires.
8581,I looked for God. I went to a temple and I didn't find him there. Then I went to a church and I didn't find him there. The I went to a mosque and I didn't find him there. Then finally I looked in my heart and there he was.

8590,"If I marry: He must be so tall that when he is on his knees, as one has said he reaches all the way to heaven. His shoulders must be broad enough to bear the burden of a family. His lips must be strong enough to smile, firm enough to say no, and tender enough to kiss. Love must be so deep that it takes its stand in Christ and so wide that it takes the whole lost world in. He must be active enough to save souls. He must be big enough to be gentle and great enough to be thoughtful. His arms must be strong enough to carry a little child."
8591,"If our children have the background of a godly, happy home and this unshakable faith that the Bible is indeed the Word of God, they will have a foundation that the forces of hell cannot shake."
8592,Worship and worry cannot live in the same heart: they are mutually exclusive.
8593,"It is a foolish woman who expects her husband to be to her that which only Jesus Christ Himself can be: always ready to forgive, totally understanding, unendingly patient, invariably tender and loving, unfailing in every area, anticipating every need, and making more than adequate provision. Such expectations put a man under an impossible strain"
8594,"God has not always answered my prayers. If He had, I would have married the wrong man -- several times!"
8595,A successful marriage is made up of two good forgivers.
8596,We cannot pray and remain the same.
8597,Just pray for a tough hide and a tender heart.
8598,"Dear God, I prayed, all unafraid (as we're inclined to do), I do not need a handsome man but let him be like You; I do not need one big and strong nor yet so very tall, nor need he be some genius, or wealthy, Lord, at all; but let his head be high, dear God, and let his eye be clear, his shoulders straight, whate'er his state, whate'er his earthly sphere; and let his face have character, a ruggedness if soul, and let his whole life show, dear God, a singleness of goal; then when he comes (as he will come) with quiet eyes aglow, I'll understand that he's the man I prayed for long ago."
8599,Temptation and testing (or a trial) are two sides of the same coin. Satan uses an occasion or a person to tempt us to fall; God uses the same to try us and make us stronger.
8600,"If I cannot give my children a perfect mother I can at least give them more of the one they've got--and make that one more loving. I will be available. I will take time to listen, time to play, time to be home when they arrive from school, time to counsel and encouerage."
8601,"I think losing a loved one must be a little like losing a leg. First there is the shock, then the anesthetic, and the painkillers; the attention of doctors and nurses, flowers and cards and visits from friends. But sooner or later you have to learn to walk without it."

8610,"Death - Death can be faced, dealt with, adjusted to, outlived. It's the not knowing that destroys interminably... This being suspended in suspense; waiting - weightless, How does one face the faceless, adjust to nothing? Waiting implies something to wait for. Is there? There is One. One who knows... I rest my soul on that."

8810,"Our ""life education"" has not necessarily taught us a satisfying way to live. We suffer from a vague sense that there must be something more, some deeper meaning. We must return to kindergarten and start to learn a way of life that is contrary to the way we approached things before-a way of life based on trust of our own inner truth. We can rediscover the child-like innocence and wisdom that knows that anything is possible."
8811,"My primary relationship is with myself- all others are mirrors of it. As I learn to love myself, I automatically receive the love and appreciation that I desire from others.

8854,"We must be careful not to choose, but to let God's Holy Spirit manage our lives; not to smooth down and explain away, but to stir up the gift and allow God's Spirit to disturb us and disturb us and disturb us until we yield and yield and yield and the possibility in God's mind for us becomes an established fact in our lives, with the rivers in evidence meeting the need of a dying world."
8855,I can't understand God by feelings. I can't understand the Lord Jesus Christ by feelings. I can only understand God the Father and Jesus Christ by what the Word says about them. God is everything the Word says He is. We need to get acquainted with Him through the Word.

8867,"Most people, including ourselves, live in a world of relative ignorance. We are even comfortable with that ignorance, because it is all we know. When we first start facing truth, the process may be frightening, and many people run back to their old lives. But if you continue to seek truth, you will eventually be able to handle it better. In fact, you want more! It's true that many people around you now may think you are weird or even a danger to society, but you don't care. Once you've tasted the truth, you won't ever want to go back to being ignorant"
8868,In every person there is a sun. Just let them shine.

8902,
8903,"Don't cry over spilled milk. By this time tomorrow, it'll be free yogurt."

8908,Thirty seconds is the exact amount of time Americans can tolerate something they don't understand.
8909,"Remember, you cannot be both young and wise. Young people who pretend to be wise to the ways of the world are mostly just cynics. Cynicism masquerades as wisdom, but it is the farthest thing from it. Because cynics don’t learn anything. Because cynicism is a self-imposed blindness, a rejection of the world because we are afraid it will hurt us or disappoint us. Cynics always say no. But saying “yes” begins things. Saying “yes” is how things grow. Saying “yes” leads to knowledge. “Yes” is for young people. So for as long as you have the strength to, say “yes'."

8922,"Happiness, like unhappiness, is a proactive choice."
8923,The most effective way I know to begin with the end in mind is to develop a personal mission statement or philosophy or creed. It focused on what you want to be (character) and to do (contributions and achievements) and on the values or principles upon which being and doing are based.

8928,Peace of mind comes when your life is in harmony with true principles and values and in no other way.

Their behavior is a product of their own conscious choice, based on values, rather than a product of their conditions, based on feeling."

8934,"When parents see their children's problems as opportunities to build the relationship instead of as negative, burdensome irritations, it totally changes the nature of parent-child interaction.

9107,"I can never read all the books I want; I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want. I can never train myself in all the skills I want. And why do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in life. And I am horribly limited."
9108,I desire the things that will destroy me in the end.
9109,"Perhaps when we find ourselves wanting everything, it is because we are dangerously close to wanting nothing."
9110,"It is a feeling that no matter what the ideas or conduct of others, there is a unique rightness and beauty to life which can be shared in openness, in wind and sunlight, with a fellow human being who believes in the same basic principles."
9111,"So many people are shut up tight inside themselves like boxes, yet they would open up, unfolding quite wonderfully, if only you were interested in them."

9130,How do rich people think and act?
9131,"If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is too. Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself. You are better than you think."

9135,"In every forest, on every farm, in every orchard on earth, it's what's under the ground that creates what's above the ground. That's why placing your attention on the fruits that you have already grown is futile. You cannot change the fruits that are already hanging on the tree. You can, however, change tomorrow's fruits. But to do so, you will have to dig below the ground and strengthen the roots."
9136,"If you want to fly with the eagles, don’t swim with the ducks!"
9137,

9141,"If we really want to pray we must first learn to listen, for in the silence of the heart God speaks."
9142,"The tendency of liberals is to create bodies of men and women-of all classes-detached from tradition, alienated from religion, and susceptible to mass suggestion-mob rule. And a mob will be no less a mob if it is well fed, well clothed, well housed, and well disciplined."

9159,"Whatever you think, be sure it is what you think; whatever you want, be sure that is what you want; whatever you feel, be sure that is what you feel."
9160,We die to each other daily. What we know of other people is only our memory of the moments during which we knew them. And they have changed since then. To pretend that they and we are the same is a useful and convenient social convention which must sometimes be broken. We must also remember that at every meeting we are meeting a stranger.
9161,Those who arrive at the end of the journey are not those who began.
9162,
9163,
9164,"This is the problem we have with many Muslim leaders: They claim to differentiate between domestic and foreign issues and they are obsessed with being accepted, at sitting at the table of power in order to talk (or rather to listen) and to be tolerated. This is the starting point of our weakness. It is in our minds because we do not realize we are part of the system."

9172,To be courageous is to be a voice for the voiceless
9173,"I am not a politician. I have often been approached in this regard, but I have always declined these sorts of offers. I view myself as an independent, critical intellectual, as someone who tries to stimulate thought on the left and the right, to encourage intellectual evolution."

9175,"For Muslims, the source of everything we do is based in the belief that there is one God, and this one God is revealing to us there is one humanity with equal dignity for each, beyond faith, color and social status.

9180,"We are in a world that is connected, but is not communicating."
9181,"The very essence of the Sufi spiritual tradition requires you to purify your heart, to liberate yourself from your ego and to be courageous in facing any corrupt power, injustice and oppression.

9186,Your sensitivity is power. Don't let people transform your qualities into weaknesses.
9187,"Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering its a feather bed."
9188,
9189,"You are a divine being. You matter, you count. You come from realms of unimaginable power and light, and you will return to those realms."
9190,Psychedelics are illegal not because a loving government is concerned that you may jump out of a third story window. Psychedelics are illegal because they dissolve opinion structures and culturally laid down models of behaviour and information processing. They open you up to the possibility that everything you know is wrong.
9191,"It is now very clear that techniques of machine-human interfacing, pharmacology of the synthetic variety, all kinds of manipulative techniques, all kinds of data storage, imaging and retrieval techniques - all of this is coalescing toward the potential of a truly demonic or angelic kind of self-imaging of our culture... And the people who are on the demonic side are fully aware of this and hurrying full-tilt forward with their plans to capture everyone as a 100% believing consumer inside some kind of a beige furnished fascism that won't even raise a ripple."
9192,"Capitalism is going to deal itself out of existence, but before it does that, you're gonna pay $50 for a latte, because inflation is going impoverish all of us before people get pissed off enough to realize that all of the last hundred years of economic progress was actually a shell game to create billionaires, while the great masses of people saw their standard of living eroded and destroyed."
9193,"The tension in the world is the tension between the ego and the feminine, not between the masculine and the feminine."
9194,The most beautiful things in the universe are inside the human mind.
9195,The Imagination is the golden pathway to everywhere.
9196,"This is the message of your life and my life - it’s that nothing lasts. Heraclitus said it: Panta Rhei. All flows, nothing lasts. Not your enemies, not your fortune, not who you sleep with at night, not the books, not the house in Saint-Tropez, not even the children - nothing lasts. To the degree that you avert your gaze from this truth, you build the potential for pain into your life. Everything is this act of embracing the present moment, the felt presence of experience, and then moving on to the next felt moment of experience. It’s literally psychological nomadism is what it is."

9202,Life must be a preparation for the transition to another dimension.
9203,"We are told No, you're unimportant, you're peripheral - get a degree, get a job, get a this, get that, and then you're a player. You don't even want to play that game. You want to reclaim your mind and get it out of the hands of the cultural engineers who want to turn you into a half-baked moron consuming all this trash that's being manufactured out of the bones of a dying world."
9204,"For all we know, we know nothing."
9205,"The problem is not to find the answer, it's to face the answer"
9206,Our ability to destroy ourselves is the mirror image of our ability to save ourselves.
9207,"The cost of sanity in this society, is a certain level﻿ of alienation"
9208,"Knowledge, or verbal facility, is no proof that you know what you're talking about."
9209,Science does not deal with subjective experience... Well that's too bad because that is all any of us ever have.
9210,"The real secret of magic is that the world is made of words, and that if you know the words that the world is made of you can make of it whatever you wish."
9211,"Claim your place in the sun and go forward into the light. The tools are there; the path is known; you simply have to turn your back on a culture that has gone sterile and dead, and get with the programme of a living world and a re-empowerment of the imagination."
9212,
9213,There is but one answer to terrorism and it is best delivered with a Winchester rifle.
9214,
9215,"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly."

9217,"What a man does for himself, dies with him. What a man does for his community lives long after he's gone."
9218,"Patriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the president or any other public official, save exactly to the degree in which he himself stands by the country. It is patriotic to support him insofar as he efficiently serves the country. It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent that by inefficiency or otherwise he fails in his duty to stand by the country. In either event, it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth, whether about the president or anyone else."
9219,Nothing worth having was ever achieved without effort.
9220,"Do what you can, with what you have, where you are."
9221,"There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn't an American at all. We have room for but one flag, the American flag...We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language...and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people."
9222,"In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing."
9223,"Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible government, to befoul the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of today."
9224,"Do Something Now. If not you, who? If not here, where? If not now, when?"

9233,"When they call the roll in the Senate, the Senators do not know whether to answer 'Present' or 'Not guilty.'"
9234,He who makes no mistakes makes no progress.
9235,"There is no room in this country for hyphenated Americanism. The one absolutely certain way of bringing this nation to ruin, of preventing all possibility of its continuing to be a nation at all, would be to permit it to become a tangle of squabbling nationalities."
9236,A thorough knowledge of the Bible is worth more than a college education.
9237,
9238,
9239,A genius is a talented person who does his homework.

9315,"When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty."
9316,"I think myself that we have more machinery of government than is necessary, too many parasites living on the labor of the industrious.

And I hope I have that desire in all that I am doing."

9343,"To be grateful is to recognize the Love of God in everything He has given us - and He has given us everything. Every breath we draw is a gift of His love, every moment of existence is a grace, for it brings with it immense graces from Him. Gratitude therefore takes nothing for granted, is never unresponsive, is constantly awakening to new wonder and to praise of the goodness of God. For the grateful person knows that God is good, not by hearsay but by experience. And that is what makes all the difference."
9344,Nothing has ever been said about God that hasn't already been said better by the wind in the pine trees.
9345,"The rush and pressure of modern life are a form, perhaps the most common form, of contemporary violence. To allow oneself to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting concerns, to surrender to too many demands, to commit oneself to too many projects, to want to help everyone in everything, is to succumb to violence. The frenzy of our activity neutralizes our work for peace. It destroys our own inner capacity for peace. It destroys the fruitfulness of our own work, because it kills the root of inner wisdom which makes work fruitful."

It is only when we are detached from ourselves that we can be at peace with ourselves."
9349,"When you see God in everyone, then they see God in you."
9350,"Instead of hating the people you think are war-makers, hate the appetites and disorder in your own soul, which are the causes of war. If you love peace, then hate injustice, hate tyranny, hate greed - but hate these things in yourself, not in another."
9351,"The deepest level of communication is not communication, but communion. It is wordless. It is beyond words, and it is beyond speech, and it is beyond concept. Not that we discover a new unity. We discover an older unity. My dear Brothers [and Sisters], we are already one. But we imagine that we are not. And what we have to recover is our original unity. What we have to be is what we are."
9352,Let us come alive to the splendor that is all around us and see the beauty in ordinary things.
9353,"Love in fact is the spiritual life, and without it all the other exercises of the spirit, however lofty, are emptied of content and become mere illusions."
9354,"In the devil's theology, the important thing is to be absolutely right and to prove that everybody else is absolutely wrong."
9355,Do not be too quick to assume your enemy is a savage just because he is your enemy. Perhaps he is your enemy because he thinks you are a savage. Or perhaps he is afraid of you because he feels that you are afraid of him.  And perhaps if he believed you are capable of loving him he would no longer be your enemy.
9356,"Do not look for rest in any pleasure, because you were not created for pleasure: you were created for joy. And if you do not know the difference between pleasure and joy you have not yet begun to live."
9357,"True encounter with Christ liberates something in us, a power we did not know we had, a hope, a capacity for life, a resilience, an ability to bounce back when we thought we were completely defeated, a capacity to grow and change, a power of creative transformation."
9358,Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone - we find it with another.
9359,"Everything in modern city life is calculated to keep man from entering into himself and thinking about spiritual things. Even with the best of intentions a spiritual man finds himself exhausted and deadened and debased by the constant noise of machines and loudspeakers, the dead air and the glaring lights of offices and shops, the everlasting suggestion of advertising and propaganda. The whole mechanism of modern life is geared for a flight from God and from the spirit into the wilderness of neurosis."
9360,"Prayer is not so much a way to find God as a way of resting in him...who loves us, who is near to us."
9361,"To say that I am made in the image of God is to say that love is the reason for my existence, for God is love. Love is my true identity. Selflessness is my true self. Love is my true character. Love is my name."

9365,The greatest tyrannies are always perpetuated in the name of the noblest causes.
9366,
9367,"No country can be called free which is governed by an absolute power; and it matters not whether it be an absolute royal power or an absolute legislative power, as the consequences will be the same to the people."
9368,You cannot undermine police authority and then complain about rising crime.
9369,"A constitution defines and limits the powers of the government it creates. It therefore follows, as a natural and also a logical result, that the governmental exercise of any power not authorized by the constitution is an assumed power, and therefore illegal."
9370,"When all other rights are taken away, the right of rebellion is made perfect."
9371,"These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands it NOW, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman."
9372,Reason obeys itself; and ignorance submits to whatever is dictated to it.
9373,"Our greatest enemies, the ones we must fight most often, are within."
9374,"I prefer peace. But if trouble must come, let it come in my time, so that my children can live in peace."
9375,The slavery of fear had made men afraid to think.
9376,"Taxes were not raised to carry on wars, but that wars were raised to carry on taxes."
9377,"Men who look upon themselves born to reign, and others to obey, soon grow insolent; selected from the rest of mankind their minds are early poisoned by importance; and the world they act in differs so materially from the world at large, that they have but little opportunity of knowing its true interests, and when they succeed to the government are frequently the most ignorant and unfit of any throughout the dominions."
9378,"The real man smiles in trouble, gathers strength from distress, and grows brave by reflection."
9379,"A constitution is not the act of a government, but of a people constituting a government; and government without a constitution is power without a right. All power exercised over a nation, must have some beginning. It must be either delegated, or assumed. There are not other sources. All delegated power is trust, and all assumed power is usurpation. Time does not alter the nature and quality of either."
9380,A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong gives it a superficial appearance of being right.
9381,Government is best which governs least
9382,"[A]ll churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Muslim, are simply human inventions. They use fear to enslave us. They are a monopoly for power and profit."
9383,"He that would make his own liberty secure, must guard even his enemy from oppression; for if he violates this duty, he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself."
9384,"It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies."
9385,"Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property... Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them."
9386,"If I do not believe as you believe, it proves that you do not believe as I believe, and that is all that it proves."
9387,
9388,Everyone can be discontented if he ignores his blessings and looks only at his burdens.

9391,"Stand for right, even if you stand alone."
9392,Happiness comes when we stop complaining about the troubles we have and offer thanks for all the troubles we don't have.
9393,"You can share your testimony in many ways, by the words you speak, by the example you set, by the manner in which you live your life."
9394,"Your Heavenly Father loves you-each of you. That love never changes. It is not influenced by your appearance, by your possessions, or by the amount of money you have in your bank account. It is not changed by your talents and abilities. It is simply there. It is there for you when you are sad or happy, discouraged or hopeful. God's love is there for you whether or not you feel you deserve love. It is simply always there."
9395,One day each of us will run out of tomorrows. Let us not put off what is important.
9396,Don’t limit yourself and don’t let others convince you that you are limited in what you can do. Believe in yourself and then live so as to reach your possibilities. You can achieve what you believe you can. Trust and believe and have faith.
9397,"It’s not enough to wish, it’s not enough to dream, it’s not enough to promise. We must do."

9401,A woman needs to be told she is beautiful. She needs to be told she is valued. She needs to be told she is worthwhile.
9402,So much in life depends on our attitude. The way we choose to see things and respond to others makes all the difference.
9403,"God left the world unfinished for man to work his skill upon. He left the electricity in the cloud, the oil in the earth. He left the rivers unbridged and the forests unfelled and the cities unbuilt. God gives to man the challenge of raw materials, not the ease of finished things. He leaves the pictures unpainted and the music unsung and the problems unsolved, that man might know the joys and glories of creation."
9404,"Family prayer is the greatest deterrent to sin, and hence the most beneficent provider of joy and happiness. The old saying is yet true: 'The family that prays together stays together.'"
9405,"As we arise each morning, let us determine to respond with love and kindness to whatever might come our way."
9406,Often we live side by side but do not communicate heart to heart.
9407,Charity is having patience with someone who has let us down. It is resisting the impulse to become offended easily. It is accepting weaknesses and shortcomings. It is accepting people as they truly are. It is looking beyond physical appearances to attributes that will not dim through time. It is resisting the impulse to categorize others.
9408,"We are reminded that anger doesn't solve anything. It builds nothing, but it can destroy everything."
9409,We are never alone when we stand with our Father in Heaven.
9410,"Raising children, be aware that the piles and piles of laundry will disappear all too soon and that you will, to your surprise, miss them profoundly."
9411,"There is really no way we can know the heart, the intentions, or the circumstances of someone who might say or do something we find reason to criticize. Thus the commandment: 'Judge not.'"

9413,
9414,"The next time some academics tell you how important diversity is, ask how many Republicans there are in their sociology department."
9415,"Racism is not dead, but it is on life support -- kept alive by politicians, race hustlers and people who get a sense of superiority by denouncing others as 'racists'"
9416,What do you call it when someone steals someone else's money secretly? Theft. What do you call it when someone takes someone else's money openly by force? Robbery. What do you call it when a politician takes someone else's money in taxes and gives it to someone who is more likely to vote for him? Social Justice.
9417,"When you want to help people, you tell them the truth. When you want to help yourself, you tell them what they want to hear."
9418,The problem isn't that Johnny can't read. The problem isn't even that Johnny can't think. The problem is that Johnny doesn't know what thinking is; he confuses it with feeling.
9419,Government's power to bully people who have broken no law is dangerous to all of us.
9420,"You cannot take any people, of any color, and exempt them from the requirements of civilization - including work, behavioral standards, personal responsibility, and all the other basic things that the clever intelligentsia disdain - without ruinous consequences to them and to society at large."
9421,"Not since the days of the Hitler Youth have young people been subjected to more propaganda on more politically correct issues.  At one time, educators boasted that their role was not to teach students what to think but how to think.  Today, their role is far too often to teach students what to think on everything from immigration to global warming to the new sacred trinity of 'race, class and gender.'"
9422,"Just as any moron can destroy a priceless Ming vase, so the shallow and ill-educated people who run our schools can undermine and destroy from within a great civilization that took centuries of dedicated effort to create and maintain."
9423,It is bad enough that so many people believe things without any evidence. What is worse is that some people have no conception of evidence and regard facts as just someone else's opinion.
9424,"You may have the right to live anyway you like, but you don't have a right to have other people like it. Respect it or pay for it."
9425,"One of the most important reasons for studying history is that virtually every stupid idea that is in vogue today has been tried before and proved disastrous before, time and again."
9426,"The welfare state has always been judged by its good intentions, rather than its bad results."
9427,"Blacks were not enslaved because they were black but because they were available. Slavery has existed in the world for thousands of years. Whites enslaved other whites in Europe for centuries before the first black was brought to the Western hemisphere. Asians enslaved Europeans. Asians enslaved other Asians. Africans enslaved other Africans, and indeed even today in North Africa, blacks continue to enslave blacks."
9428,"In a democracy, we have always had to worry about the ignorance of the uneducated.  Today we have to worry about the ignorance of people with college degrees."
9429,"The welfare state is the oldest con game in the world. First you take people's money away quietly, and then you give some of it back to them flamboyantly."
9430,"One of the sad signs of our times is that we have demonized those who produce, subsidized those who refuse to produce, and canonized those who complain."
9431,"If you believe in equal rights, then what do “women’s rights,” “gay rights,” etc., mean? Either they are redundant or they are violations of the principle of equal rights for all."
9432,What exactly is your 'fair share' of what 'someone else' has worked for?
9433,"Activism is a way for useless people to feel important, even if the consequences of their activism are counterproductive for those they claim to be helping and damaging to the fabric of society as a whole."
9434,"The reason so many people misunderstand so many issues is not that these issues are so complex, but that people do not want a factual or analytical explanation that leaves them emotionally unsatisfied. They want villains to hate and heroes to cheer - and they don't want explanations that do not give them that."
9435,"A friend from India told me that a countryman of his said: ""I want to go to America. I want to see a country where poor people are fat."""
9436,"One of the painful signs of years of dumbed-down education is how many people are unable to make a coherent argument. They can vent their emotions, question other people's motives, make bold assertions, repeat slogans-- anything except reason."
9437,
9438,"If you don't have time, the truth is, you don't have priorities. Think harder; don't work harder."
9439,It isn't enough to think outside the box. Thinking is passive. Get used to acting outside the box.
9440,"Tomorrow becomes never. No matter how small the task, take the first step now!"
9441,"One can steal ideas, but no one can steal execution or passion."
9442,There are two components that are fundamental to enjoy life and feel good about yourself: continual learning and service.
9443,Being busy is a form of laziness - lazy thinking and indiscriminate action. Being busy is most often used as a guise for avoiding the few critically important but uncomfortable actions.

9445,"The best way to improve mental performance, is to improve physical performance"

9447,"To do the impossible, you need to ignore the popular."
9448,Money doesn't change you; it reveals who you are when you no longer have to be nice.
9449,Lack of time is actually lack of priorities.
9450,"But you are the average of the five people you associate with most, so do not underestimate the effects of your pessimistic, unambitious, or disorganized friends. If someone isn't making you stronger, they're making you weaker."
9451,The most important actions are never comfortable.
9452,"An entrepreneur isn't someone who owns a business, it's someone who makes things happen."
9453,"Luxury, to me, is not owning a lot of stuff. Luxury, to me, is feeling unrushed."
9454,"The question you should be asking isn't, ""What do I want?"" or ""What are my goals?"" but ""What would excite me?"
9455,What you do is infinitely more important than how you do it.
9456,"There are tons of things in your home and life that you don't use, need, or even particularly want. They just came into your life as impulsive flotsam and jetsam and never found a good exit. Whether you're aware of it or not, this clutter creates indecision and distractions."
9457,"Believe it or not, it is not only possible to accomplish more by doing less, it is mandatory. Enter the world of elimination."
9458,"For all of the most important things, the timing always sucks. Waiting for a good time to quit your job? The stars will never align and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the same time. The universe doesn't conspire against you, but it doesn't go out of its way to line up the pins either. Conditions are never perfect. ""Someday"" is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it's important to you and you want to do it ""eventually,"" just do it and correct course along the way."
9459,Slow down and remember this: Most things make no difference. Being busy is a form of mental laziness-lazy thinking and indiscriminate action.
9460,Slow down and remember this: Most things make no difference.
9461,Being selective-doing less-is the path of the productive. Focus on the important few and ignore the rest.
9462,
9463,"The only love that won’t disappoint you is one that can’t change, that can’t be lost, that is not based on the ups and downs of life or of how well you live. It is something that not even death can take away from you. God’s love is the only thing like that."
9464,"The gospel is this: We are more sinful and flawed in ourselves than we ever dared believe, yet at the very same time we are more loved and accepted in Jesus Christ than we ever dared hope."
9465,"Jesus Christ did not suffer so that you would not suffer. He suffered so that when you suffer, you’ll become more like him. The gospel does not promise you better life circumstances; it promises you a better life."
9466,"Like a baby learning language, we learn how to communicate with God by listening to His words first."
9467,"Religion says earn your life. Secular society says create your life. Jesus says, 'My life for your life."
9468,Putting our faith in Christ is not about trying harder; it means transferring our trust away from ourselves and resting in him.
9469,How do you change your behavior? Change what you worship
9470,"Legalistic remorse says, ""I broke God's rules,"" while real repentance says, ""I broke God's heart."""
9471,The Gospel is good news not good advice. Advice = what we should do. News = report of what was done for us.
9472,"Worry is not believing God will get it right, and bitterness is believing God got it wrong."
9473,Suffering can refine us rather than destroy us because God himself walks with us in the fire.
9474,The only person who dares wake up a king at 3:00 AM for a glass of water is a child. We have that kind of access
9475,"If God is not at the center of your life, something else is."
9476,"Jesus didn't come to tell us the answers to the questions of life, he came to be the answer."
9477,"The Bible’s purpose is not so much to show you how to live a good life. The Bible’s purpose is to show you how God’s grace breaks into your life against your will and saves you from the sin and brokenness otherwise you would never be able to overcome… religion is ‘if you obey, then you will be accepted’. But the Gospel is, ‘if you are absolutely accepted, and sure you’re accepted, only then will you ever begin to obey’. Those are two utterly different things. Every page of the Bible shows the difference."
9478,"God looks at the anxious and says, I tore my Son to shreds for you, and you're afraid I will not give you what you need?"
9479,"The basic purpose of prayer is not to bend God's will to mine, but to mold my will into His."
9480,"The Christian Gospel is that I am so flawed that Jesus had to die for me, yet I am so loved and valued that Jesus was glad to die for me. This leads to deep humility and deep confidence at the same time. It undermines both swaggering and sniveling. I cannot feel superior to anyone, and yet I have nothing to prove to anyone. I do not think more of myself nor less of myself. Instead, I think of myself less."
9481,Every single emotion you have should be processed in prayer.
9482,"Success and suffering will either darken your heart or make you wise, but they won't leave you where you were."
9483,How does Satan accuse us? By causing us to look at our sin rather than our Savior.

9492,Life is improvisation.
9493,Confidence is 10 percent hard work and 90 percent delusion.
9494,Don't waste your energy trying to educate or change opinions... Do your thing and don't care if they like it.
9495,Why are my arms so weak? It's like I did that push-up last year for nothing!
9496,"You can’t be that kid standing at the top of the waterslide, overthinking it. You have to go down the chute."
9497,"You go through big chunks of time where you're just thinking, 'this is impossible - oh,this is impossible'. And then you just keep going and keep going, and you sort of do the impossible."
9498,"Now every girl is expected to have: Caucasian blue eyes, full Spanish lips, a classic button nose, hairless Asian skin with a California tan, a Jamaican dance hall ass, long Swedish legs, small Japanese feet, the abs of a lesbian gym owner, the hips of a nine-year-old boy, the arms of Michelle Obama, and doll tits. The person closest to actually achieving this look is Kim Kardashian, who, as we know, was made by Russian scientists to sabotage our athletes."
9499,Whatever the problem - be part of the solution
9500,Just say yes and you'll figure it out afterwards.

9503,"A Harvard Medical School study has determined that rectal thermometers are still the best way to tell a baby's temperature. Plus, it really teaches the baby who's boss."

9505,"It was reported that Guy Ritchie has cast his wife Madonna in a small walk-on role in his new movie, Revolver. Madonna will play the part of the woman who ruins the film."
9506,"Photoshop is just like makeup. When it’s done well it looks great, and when it’s overdone you look like a crazy asshole."
9507,And I can see Russia from my house.
9508,"If you retain nothing else, always remember the most important Rule of Beauty. “Who cares?”"
9509,"In a study, scientists report that drinking beer can be good for the liver. I'm sorry, did I say 'scientists'? I meant Irish people."
9510,I want to thank my parents for somehow raising me to have confidence that is disproportionate with my looks and abilities.
9511,"In order to feel safer on his private jet, actor John Travolta has purchased a bomb-sniffing dog. Unfortunately for the actor, the dog came six movies too late."
9512,
9513,"There is no time for despair, no place for self-pity, no need for silence, no room for fear. We speak, we write, we do language. That is how civilizations heal."
9514,"I tell my students, 'When you get these jobs that you have been so brilliantly trained for, just remember that your real job is that if you are free, you need to free somebody else. If you have some power, then your job is to empower somebody else. This is not just a grab-bag candy game."
9515,"I know the world is bruised and bleeding, and though it is important not to ignore its pain, it is also critical to refuse to succumb to its malevolence. Like failure, chaos contains information that can lead to knowledge - even wisdom. Like art."
9516,The function of freedom is to free someone else.
9517,"There is no such thing as race. None. There is just a human race - scientifically, anthropologically. Racism is a construct, a social construct... it has a social function, racism."
9518,"From my point of view, your life is already a miracle of chance waiting for you to shape its destiny."
9519,"If there's a book you really want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it."

9521,Make a difference about something other than yourselves.
9522,All important things are hard.
9523,
9524,"It's important, therefore, to know who the real enemy is, and to know the function, the very serious function of racism, which is distraction. It keeps you from doing your work. It keeps you explaining over and over again, your reason for being. Somebody says you have no language and so you spend 20 years proving that you do. Somebody says your head isn't shaped properly so you have scientists working on the fact that it is. Someone says you have no art so you dredge that up. Somebody says you have no kingdoms and so you dredge that up. None of that is necessary. There will always be one more thing."
9525,A friend gathers all the pieces and gives them back in the right order.
9526,"Racism will disappear when it's no longer profitable, and no longer psychologically useful. And when that happens, it'll be gone. But at the moment, people make a lot of money off of it, pro and con."

9530,The peace I am thinking of is the dance of an open mind when it engages another equally open one.
9531,"I am a writer and my faith in the world of art is intense, but not irrational, nor naïve - because art takes us and makes us take a journey beyond price, beyond cost, into bearing witness to the world as it is and as it should be. Art invites us to know beauty and to solicit it, summon it, from even the most tragic of circumstances."
9532,Let your face speak what's in your heart.
9533,"Please don't settle for happiness. It's not good enough. Of course you deserve it, but if that's all you have in mind - happiness - I want to suggest to you that personal success devoid of meaningfulness, free of a steady commitment to social justice - that's more than a barren life. It's a trivial one."
9534,"Your life is already artful-waiting, just waiting, for you to make it art."
9535,Liberation means you don't have to be silenced.
9536,"Definitions belong to the definers, not the defined."
9537,
9538,It's not about the goal. It's about becoming the type of person that can accomplish the goal.

9548,"If you are going to succeed, you must deal with what caused you to fail"
9549,"It's not about your resources, it's about your resourcefulness ."
9550,"Where focus goes, energy flows. And where energy flows, whatever you're focusing on grows. In other words, your life is controlled by what you focus on. That's why you need to focus on where you want to go, not on what you fear. When you next find yourself in a state of uncertainty, resist your fear. Shift your focus toward where you want to go and your actions will take you in that direction."
9551,"If you want anything to change, you've got to change it. If you want things to get better, you've got to get better. And the only way to really do well in life is to find more value than anybody."
9552,"Most people aren't really happy, but they aren't unhappy enough to do anything about it. That's a dangerous place to be."

9558,"It is your decisions, and not your conditions, that determine your destiny."
9559,Love is not a business. It's not a transaction. It's not an exchange or something you get for doing something it's not a trade. It's a gift!
9560,
9561,Expect change. Analyze the landscape. Take the opportunities. Stop being the chess piece; become the player. It's your move.
9562,
9563,"Sometimes you just have to turn the page to realize there's more to your book of life than the page you're stuck on. Stop being afraid to move on. Close this chapter of hurt, and never re-read it. It's time to get what your life deserves, and move on from the things that don't deserve you. Don't try to fix what's been broken in your past, let your future create something better."
9564,"Everybody isn't your friend. Just because they hang around you and laugh with you doesn't mean they're for you.

At the end of the day real situations expose fake people so pay attention."

9566,"A relationship means you come together to make each other better. It’s not all about you, and it’s not all about them. Its all about the relationship.

9615,"The law of love and compassion for all living creatures is again a doctrine to which we are all too ready to pay slip service. However, if it is to become a reality, it requires a process of education, a veritable mental renaissance. Once it has become a reality, national as well as international problems will fall into perspectives and become easier to solve. Wars and conflicts, too, will then become a thing of the past, because wars begin in the minds of men, and in those minds love and compassion would have built the defenses of peace."

And the same question will be here in another 20 years, I guarantee you. Until you stop asking that question. When that question is not there, you are there.

9628,"I have searched everywhere to find an answer to my question, 'Is there enlightenment?' but have never questioned the search itself. Because I have assumed that goal of enlightenment exists, I have had to search. It is the search itself which has been choking me and keeping me out of my natural state. There is no such thing as spiritual or psychological enlightenment because there is no such thing as spirit or psyche at all. I have been a damn fool all my life, searching for something which does not exist. My search is at an end."

Once that hits you, the whole mechanism of the body that is controlled by this thought is shattered. What is left is the tremendous living organism with an intelligence of its own. What you are left with is the pulse, the beat and the throb of life."
9630,*Only if you reject all the other paths can you discover your own path.
9631,"You think when you don't want to do anything. Thinking is a poor alternative to acting. Your thinking is consuming all your energy. Act, don't think!"
9632,"All your experiences, all your meditations, all your prayer, all that you do, is self-centred. It is strengthening the self, adding momentum, gathering momentum, so it is taking you in the opposite direction. Whatever you do to be free from the self also is a self-centred activity."

9649,"When you paint success pictures in your mind, you initiate an inner process whereby your attitudes, hopes, aspirations, and enthusiasm are elevated in response to an image of a more promising future. Every person who aspires must first sell themselves hope, the promise of a better life."
9650,Pessimists are second rate people. They do not believe in life. ... All they want to do is drag you down and appease their own feelings of mediocrity and fear.

9772,"Given that there are seven billion people living on this earth, there is a consistent quantity of imbecile or idiot, okay. Previously, these people could express themselves only with their friends or at the bar after two or three glasses of something, and they said every silliness, and people laughed. Now they have the possibility to show up on the internet. And so, on the internet, along with the messages of a lot of interesting and important people - even the Pope is writing on Twitter - we have a great quantity of idiots."
9773,"To survive, you must tell stories."
9774,"All the blogs, Facebook, Twitter are made by people who want to show their own private affairs at the price of making fakes, to try to appear such as they are not, to construct another personality, which is a veritable loss of identity."
9775,"I believe that what we become depends on what our fathers teach us at odd moments, when they aren't trying to teach us. We are formed by little scraps of wisdom."
9776,"Poetry is not a matter of feelings, it is a matter of language. It is language which creates feelings."
9777,"The problem with the Internet is that it gives you everything - reliable material and crazy material. So the problem becomes, how do you discriminate?"
9778,"Never affirm, always allude: allusions are made to test the spirit and probe the heart."
9779,"I have come to believe that the whole world is an enigma, a harmless enigma that is made terrible by our own mad attempt to interpret it as though it had an underlying truth."
9780,Love is wiser than wisdom.
9781,"Originality and creativity are nothing but the result of the wise management of combinations. The creative genius combines more rapidly, and with a greater critical sense of what gets tossed out and what gets saved, the same material that the failed genius has to work with."
9782,"We are always remaking history. Our memory is always an interpretive reconstruction of the past, so is perspective."
9783,What is life if not the shadow of a fleeting dream?
9784,We are formed by little scraps of wisdom.
9785,I always assume that a good book is more intelligent than its author. It can say things that the writer is not aware of.
9786,"We have a limit, a very discouraging, humiliating limit: death. That's why we like all the things that we assume have no limits and, therefore, no end. It's a way of escaping thoughts about death. We like lists because we don't want to die."
9787,I love the smell of book ink in the morning.
9788,I have lost the freedom of not having an opinion.
9789,
9790,"It is foolish to be convinced without evidence, but it is equally foolish to refuse to be convinced by real evidence."
9791,"You don't have to be satisfied with America as you find it. You can change it. I didn't like the way I found America some sixty years ago, and I've been trying to change it ever since."
9792,One of the necessary accompaniments of capitalism in a democracy is political corruption.
9793,"I don't know whether anyone will care to examine my heart, but if they do, they will find two words there- 'social justice.' For that is what I have believed in and fought for."
9794,"I aimed at the public's heart, and by accident I hit it in the stomach."
9795,"Journalism is one of the devices whereby industrial autocracy keeps its control over political democracy; it is the day-by-day, between-elections propaganda, whereby the minds of the people are kept in a state of acquiescence, so that when the crisis of an election comes, they go to the polls and cast their ballots for either one of the two candidates of their exploiters."
9796,"The American People will take Socialism, but they won't take the label. I certainly proved it in the case of EPIC [End Poverty in California]. Running on the Socialist ticket I got 60,000 votes, and running on the slogan to 'End Poverty in California' I got 879,000. I think we simply have to recognize the fact that our enemies have succeeded in spreading the Big Lie. There is no use attacking it by a front attack, it is much better to out-flank them."
9797,The private control of credit is the modern form of slavery.
9798,You can't make somebody understand something if their salary depends upon them not understanding it.
9799,Fascism is capitalism plus murder.
9800,"When the masters of industry pay such sums for a newspaper, they buy not merely the building and the presses and the name; they buy what they call the ""good-will""- that is, they buy you. And they proceed to change your whole psychology - everything that you believe about life. You might object to it, if you knew; but they do their work so subtly that you never guess what is happening to you!"
9801,"The supreme crime of the church to-day is that everywhere and in all its operations and influences it is on the side of sloth of mind; that it banishes brains, it sanctifies stupidity, it canonizes incompetence."
9802,"American journalism is a class institution, serving the rich and spurning the poor."
9803,"There is one kind of prison where the man is behind bars, and everything that he desires is outside; and there is another kind where the things are behind the bars, and the man is outside."
9804,"Can you blame me if I am pursued by the thought of how much we could do to remedy social evils, if only we had an honest and disinterested press?"
9805,They use everything about the hog except the squeal.
9806,"Man is an evasive beast, given to cultivating strange notions about himself."
9807,"Into this wild-beast tangle these men had been born without their consent, they had taken part in it because they could not help it; that they were in jail was no disgrace to them, for the game had never been fair, the dice were loaded. They were swindlers and thieves of pennies and dimes, and they had been trapped and put out of the way by the swindlers and thieves of millions of dollars."
9808,"Consider Christmas - could Satan in his most malignant mood have devised a worse combination of graft plus bunkum than the system whereby several hundred million people get a billion or so gifts for which they have no use, and some thousands of shop clerks die of exhaustion while selling them, and every other child in the Western world is made ill from overeating - all in the name of the lowly Jesus?"
9809,"The first thing brought forth by the study of any religion, ancient or modern, is that it is based upon Fear, born of it, fed by it — and that it cultivates the source from which its nourishment is derived."
9810,"I have not only found good health, but perfect health; I have found a new state of being, a potentiality of life; a sense of lightness and cleanness and joyfulness, such as I did not know could exist in the human body."
9811,"Through fasting. . .I have found a perfect health, a new state of existence, a feeling of purity and happiness, something unknown to humans."
9812,"But I have a conscience and a religious faith, and I know that our liberties were not won without suffering, and may be lost again through our cowardice. I intend to do my duty to my
 country."
9813,I am sustained by a sense of the worthwhileness of what I am doing; a trust in the good faith of the process which created and sustains me. That process I call God.
9814,
9815,"Do what you love. When you love your work, you become the best worker in the world."
9816,I was sued by a woman who claimed that she became pregnant because she watched me on television and I bent her contraceptive coil.
9817,I believe that we're all connected to each other with an invisible spiritual thread through which we can transmit energy emissions and positive thinking. I want you to use your visualization techniques.
9818,"If you're brilliant and open-minded, you can start at the top."
9819,I don't fear death because I believe it is a transition. Our souls can't be destroyed. I know we are going to live in another life.
9820,I no longer want to be rich because I am rich.
9821,"Our meaning is to make our little planet Earth a better place to live, to stop wars, disarm nuclear missiles, to stop diseases, AIDS, plague, cancer and to stop pollution."
9822,"I was about five years old when I was eating soup in our kitchen, and as I was lifting the spoon towards my mouth, it bent and broke in half."
9823,I'll no longer say that I have supernatural powers. I am an entertainer. I want to do a good show. My entire character has changed.
9824,"Nowadays even presidents, vice-presidents, and heads of big agencies are opening their minds to accept psychic phenomena, because they know it works."
9825,"Either the phone is so seriously thin and flimsy that it is bendable with mere physical force, which I cannot believe given the extensive tests Apple would have done. Or -- and this is far more plausible -- somehow the energy and excitement of the 10 million people who purchased iPhones has awakened their mind powers and caused the phones to bend."
9826,"The lnternet is turning economics inside-out. For example, everybody on the internet now wants stuff for free and there are so many free services available."
9827,"We're all brilliant at something. I discovered my powers when I was four years old. When you're young you're more in touch with your real talents, but so often the 30 year slog knocks it out of people."
9828,"I think I usually have quite ordinary dreams. Sometimes my dreams take me to other dimensions. I can travel in my mind especially when I'm dreaming I focus my mind on what I want to dream. If I want to fly, I focus on flying."
9829,"Larry Geller’s Leaves of Elvis’ Garden is by far the best book I have ever read about Elvis.  It is emotional, revealing and spiritual, and offers the most amazing insight into the king.  I highly recommend this dynamic book."
9830,"I believe in past lives but I know nothing about mine and I don't want to know. I live in the present, taking one day at a time."
9831,"I sought a great performer who would deeply impress me, and I found Lior Suchard."
9832,I'm a religious man. I am Jewish but I believe in all religions. I believe in God and see him as an old man with a big white beard and pray to him every day for a few minutes.
9833,"I've stopped caring about skeptics, but if they libel or defame me they will end up in court."
9834,Ive just taught thousands of people over the radio in the USA how to mend broken watches and broken house appliances. I am a catalyst or trigger to access these powers.
9835,"So, I am independently well-off and don't have to do anything, but I still do. I write books, lecture around the world, work with scientists and governments."
9836,"I've seen lights in the sky, I've seen UFOs, I've even seen something on the ground that I can't explain, but I've never actually seen a being. I wish I had."
9837,"Scientists want full proof under laboratory conditions. And the answer is very simple: When Im put under pressure, I cant perform. Even the phenomenon Im most known for. When Im on stage, Im not under pressure and it happens. In other important places, it happens. But in a laboratory where I really want it to happen, its very hard for me."
9838,"I don't take myself seriously all the time; I have to do quirky things, such as helping football teams, moving the ball away from McAllister's foot, getting into The Sun and The Star - because, you know, I like sensationalism, it's a part of what I do."
9839,
9840,Every child needs at least one adult who is irrationally crazy about him or her.
9841,"Turning on the television set can turn off the process that transforms children into people... It is primarily through observing, playing, and working with others older and younger than himself that a child discovers both what he can do and who he can become — that he develops both his ability and his identity."
9842,"No society can long sustain itself unless its members have learned the sensitivities, motivations and skills involved in assisting and caring for other human beings."
9843,"If the children and youth of a nation are afforded opportunity to develop their capacities to the fullest, if they are given the knowledge to understand the world and the wisdom to change it, then the prospects for the future are bright. In contrast, a society which neglects its children, however well it may function in other respects, risks eventual disorganization and demise."
9844,"Development, it turns out, occurs through this process of progressively more complex exchange between a child and somebody else- especially somebody who’s crazy about that child"
9845,"There is no more critical indicator of the future of a society than the character, competence, and integrity of its youth."
9846,Particular attention should be given to the opportunities which the environment presents or precludes for involvement of children with persons both older and younger than themselves.
9847,"We as a nation need to be reeducated about the necessary and sufficient conditions for making human beings human. We need to be reeducated not as parents--but as workers, neighbors, and friends; and as members of the organizations, committees, boards--and, especially, the informal networks that control our social institutions and thereby determine the conditions of life for our families and their children."
9848,"The primary danger of the television screen lies not so much in the behavior it produces as the behavior it prevents-the talks, the games, the family activities and the arguments through which much of the child's learning takes place and his character is formed."
9849,"Witness the American ideal: the Self-Made Man. But there is no such person. If we can stand on our own two feet, it is because others have raised us up. If, as adults, we can lay claim to competence and compassion, it only means that other human beings have been willing and enabled to commit their competence and compassion to us--through infancy, childhood, and adolescence, right up to this very moment."
9850,"In today's world parents find themselves at the mercy of a society which imposes pressures and priorities that allow neither timenor place for meaningful activities and relations between children and adults, which downgrade the role of parents and the functions of parenthood, and which prevent the parent from doing things he wants to do as a guide, friend, and companion to his children."
9851,"In the United States, it is now possible for a person eighteen years of age, female as well as male, to graduate from high school, college, or university without ever having cared for, or even held, a baby; without ever having looked after someone who was old, ill, or lonely; or without ever having comforted or assisted another human being who really needed help... No society can long sustain itself unless its members have learned the sensitivities, motivations, and skills involved in assisting and caring for other human beings."
9852,"In the planning and designing of new communities, housing projects, and urban renewal, the planners both private and public, need to give explicit consideration to the kind of world that is being created for the children who will be growing up in these settings. Particular attention should be given to the opportunities which the environment presents or precludes for involvement of children both older and younger than themselves."
9853,"Thus if we know a child has had sufficient opportunity to observe and acquire a behavioural sequence, and we know he is physically capable of performng the act but does not do so, tehn it is reasonable to assume that it is motivation which is lacking"
9854,"Like the sorcerer of old, the television set casts its magic spell, freezing speech and action and turning the living into silent statues so long as the enchantment lasts. The primary danger of the television screen lies not so much in the behavior it produces as the behavior it prevents — the talks, the games, the family festivities and arguments."
9855,"One of the most significant effects of age-segregation in our society has been the isolation of children from the world of work. Whereas in the past children not only saw what their parents did for a living but even shared substantially in the task, many children nowadays have only a vague notion of the nature of the parent's job, and have had little or no opportunity to observe the parent, or for that matter any other adult, when he is fully engaged in his work."
9856,"Thus if we know a child has had sufficient opportunity to observe and acquire a behavioral sequence, and we know he is physically capable of performing the act but does not do so, then it is reasonable to assume that it is motivation which is lacking. The appropriate countermeasure then involves increasing the subjective value of the desired act relative to any competing response tendencies he might have, rather than having the model senselessly repeat an already redundant sequence of behavior."
9857,"If the Russians have gone too far in subjecting the child and his peer group to conformity to a single set of values imposed by the adult society, perhaps we have reached the point of diminishing returns in allowing excessive autonomy and in failing to utilize the constructive potential of the peer group in developing social responsibility and consideration for others."
9858,
9859,I don't have time to think about age. There are so many things to do.
9860,"Even if you have $20,000 to buy an item, you still try to get a good price at antique stores. I collect furniture, rugs, paintings, frames. It's my hobby to go around to shops and markets."
9861,I take care of my flowers and my cats. And enjoy food. And that's living.
9862,I love everything that's beautiful. A lot of things.
9863,"Everything is a piece of me, a moment of my life."
9864,"I don't use my body to seduce, no. I just stand there."
9865,"I suddenly find out that I'm 60, and I get shocked by the number, because I feel like I'm 20."
9866,"If I don't have room for an item, I put it in warehouses."
9867,"They offered me one cover about 10 years ago, and I said, no, I can't do it. I'm happy to cover up now."
9868,I wanted to be a decorator. I wanted to interior design homes and do everything myself.
9869,"If the role demands it, then naturally I will remove my clothes."
9870,"It's going to be over soon, so I don't really have time to get busy."
9871,I hate the word sexy.
9872,Collecting is my joy; it gives me great satisfaction.
9873,"When I go to a country, I go to flea markets, antique stores. I am always looking for something."
9874,"I hate to look at myself in a mirror, and I never go and see films."
9875,I couldn't live up to it. So I chose to run away.
9876,"I fell from the sky. I'm a parachutist, and I missed my mark."
9877,I mostly gave away what I had from the James Bond movie.
9878,Don't take anything from me because I'll track it down.
9879,Collecting is my passion.
9880,I never went to school. I never went to acting school because I was so scared.
9881,I'm always shocked when I see myself because I don't recognize myself.
9882,"Elvis and I continued to be friends, and I saw him once or twice a year. But he was a troubled person."
9883,
9884,Go to bed; tired is stupid.
9885,"We live in capitalism, its power seems inescapable - but then, so did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art. Very often in our art, the art of words."
9886,"Change is freedom, change is life. It's always easier not to think for oneself. Find a nice safe hierarchy and settle in. Don't make changes, don't risk disapproval, don't upset your syndics. It's always easiest to let yourself be governed. There's a point, around age twenty, when you have to choose whether to be like everybody else the rest of your life, or to make a virtue of your peculiarities. Those who build walls are their own prisoners. I'm going to go fulfil my proper function in the social organism. I'm going to go unbuild walls."
9887,People who deny the existence of dragons are often eaten by dragons. From within.
9888,"No darkness lasts forever. And even there, there are stars."
9889,"You cannot buy the revolution. You cannot make the revolution. You can only be the revolution. It is in your spirit, or it is nowhere."
9890,"The only thing that makes life possible is permanent, intolerable uncertainty; not knowing what comes next."
9891,The worst walls are never the ones you find in your way. The worst walls are the ones you put there .
9892,To have a choice at all is to be privileged.
9893,"We read books to find out who we are. What other people, real or imaginary, do and think and feel... is an essential guide to our understanding of what we ourselves are and may become."
9894,"Capitalism’s grow-or-die imperative stands radically at odds with ecology’s imperative of interdependence and limit. The two imperatives can no longer coexist with each other; nor can any society founded on the myth that they can be reconciled hope to survive. Either we will establish an ecological society or society will go under for everyone, irrespective of his or her status."
9895,"Injustice makes the rules, and courage breaks them."
9896,To see that your life is a story while you're in the middle of living it may be a help to living it well.
9897,"A writer is a person who cares what words mean, what they say, how they say it. Writers know words are their way towards truth and freedom, and so they use them with care, with thought, with fear, with delight. By using words well they strengthen their souls. Story-tellers and poets spend their lives learning that skill and art of using words well. And their words make the souls of their readers stronger, brighter, deeper."
9898,What sane person could live in this world and not be crazy?
9899,What goes too long unchanged destroys itself.
9900,The only questions that really matter are the ones you ask yourself.
9901,
9902,"If you evade suffering, you also evade the chance of joy."
9903,"To hear, one must be silent."
9904,"This is. And thou art. There is no safety. There is no end. The word must be heard in silence. There must be darkness to see the stars. The dance is always danced above the hollow place, above the terrible abyss."
9905,A dangerous book will always be in danger from those it threatens with the demand that they question their assumptions. They'd rather hang on to the assumptions and ban the book.
9906,You can go home again...so long as you understand that home is a place where you have never been.
9907,"To be oneself is a rare thing, and a great one."
9908,
9909,Emotion combined with an artist's discipline is the rarest thing in the world.
9910,"The creative artist is the one wanting to make order out of chaos. The rest of us just accept disorder -if we even recognize it- and get a bang out of our five beautiful senses, if we’re lucky."
9911,The grave's a fine and quiet place but none I think do finish their books from there.
9912,
9913,
9914,"Don't think about the start of the race, think about the ending."
9915,Believe in your dreams and that anything is possible.
9916,
9917,"I just imagine all the other runners are big spiders, and then I get super scared."
9918,"I think sometimes, when you're on top and all you do is win, win, win, win, win, you get lazy and lose focus. When you lose it opens your eyes and you get serious. There is always a time when it is good to lose, at the right time for you."
9919,
9920,"I know what I can do, so I never doubt myself."
9921,I want to thank GOD for everything he as done for me cause without him none of this wouldn't be possible.
9922,"No matter who you are, no matter what you're doing, no matter how focus you are, no matter how ready you think you? are, you're not gonna catch me"
9923,"For me, I'm focused on what I want to do. I know what I need to do to be a champion, so I'm working on it."
9924,"I have just accepted certain things and it makes it easier. I accept I will get injured. I accept I cannot win every race. I work hard to decrease the chances of those things happening but I accept they will happen. A lot of people don't accept it. They get injured, they go crazy."
9925,I don't think limits.
9926,You have to get to the worst to get better.
9927,I stopped worrying about the start. The end is what's important.
9928,I just want to push the barriers and see what I can do and how far I can go. I am just determined and driven.
9929,I know what I can do so it doesn't bother me what other people think or their opinion on the situation.
9930,"Each training session I'm getting better and better. I have no other duties now, no worries, it's all about training, eating and sleeping. I have a lot more time and can put a lot more effort into training. I'm feeling better every day. As long as I'm feeling myself I'm definitely in no doubt I can go to the Olympics and win."
9931,"I work hard, and I do good, and I'm going to enjoy myself. I'm not going to let you restrict me."
9932,Repeating is harder than anything else.
9933,I never single out any one competitor. I treat all my rivals equally.
9934,"Manners is the key thing. Say, for instance, when you're growing up, you're walking down the street, you've got to tell everybody good morning. Everybody. You can't pass one person."
9935,"Cristiano is better than Messi, without a doubt. He's more of an all-round player"
9936,"For me, time is everything, because from the time you wake up you have to have your heart and soul in this. You have to work through the day, you have to go to the gym, you have to eat, and yet you have to work as fast as possible to get home and get rest before the next day begins again."
9937,
9938,Success is all about having the confidence to shoot for something even if it seems impossible.
9939,
9940,
9941,Learn from the mistakes of others. You can't make them all yourself.
9942,"You are who you are, and in the end, If you don't believe it then no one will."
9943,"There's always that one person, That will always have your heart. That one person for me is you."
9944,You either evolve or dissolve.
9945,"For a woman to be able to dominate and also be feminine and soft, that's a talent. And its not all about appearance. A woman who has a brain, who is street-smart and book-smart, that woman is very, very sexy to me."
9946,
9947,Success is measured by personal happiness.
9948,Giving a child an education is by far one of the most important investments we can make.

9955,"Breaking up is a natural evolution when you try to figure out what you want in life. If you're with an individual who isn't moving in the same direction and at the same rate that you are, it ain't going to work."
9956,"You are my superstar. I'm your number one fan, give me your autograph, sign it right here on my heart. Girl, I'll be your groupie, baby."
9957,Sleeping is forbidden at the age of 22. It's all work and no play.
9958,"I think it's important for us to believe in one another's capabilities. If I didn't have someone to believe in me, I wouldn't be the individual I am today. Neither would I strive for new territory or new direction or to believe in myself."
9959,"The first time I got a chance to meet Michael was onstage at Madison Square Garden. There were tons of people on the stage, and I just remember losing my mind. Like, Oh my God, that's Michael Jackson right there. I was just over his right shoulder. And then when I finally got a chance to get on the stage with him, I was just shut down. He had the type of magic that you just bowed to. I just said, ""I love you, and I know you've heard it a million and one times from fans all over the world, but you've meant so much to me as an entertainer, and I love you, and I've admired you all these years."
9960,Down time is not the name of the game.

9962,
9963,"The knowledge that every day there is something more to learn, something higher to reach for, something new to make for others, makes each day infinitely precious"
9964,All tedious research is worth one inspired moment.
9965,We must overcome the notion that we must be regular... it robs you of the chance to be extraordinary and leads you to the mediocre.
9966,"Theoretically, the actor ought to be more sound in mind and body than other people, since he learns to understand the psychological problems of human beings when putting his own passions, his loves, fears, and rages to work in the service of the characters he plays. He will learn to face himself, to hide nothing from himself- and to do so takes AN INSATIABLE CURIOSITY ABOUT THE HUMAN CONDITION"
9967,"The actor must know that since he, himself, is the instrument, he must play on it to serve the character with the same effortless dexterity with which the violinist makes music on his. Just because he doesn't look like a violin is no reason to assume his techniques should be thought of as less difficult."
9968,"Talent is an amalgam of high sensitivity; easy vulnerability; high sensory equipment (seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, tasting intensely); a vivid imagination as well as a grip on reality; the desire to communicate one's own experience and sensations, to make one's self heard and seen."
9969,"Since the time of the ancient Greeks a democracy has depended on its philosophers and creative artists. It can only flourish by continuous probing, prodding, and questioning of the social conditions under which man exists and tries to better himself. One of the first moves of a dictatorship is to stifle the artists and thinkers who have the ability to stir up dissent from any prescribed dogma which might enslave them. Because the artist can arouse the curiosity and conscience of his community, he becomes a threat to those who have taken power."
9970,To rebel or revolt against the status quo is in the very nature of an artist.
9971,"Thoughts and feelings are suspended in a vacuum unless they instigate and feed the selected actions, and it is the characters actions which reveal the character in the play."
9972,One cannot demand of art that it pay you in any other way than in the satisfaction of the work itself.
9973,"For some strange reason, we believe that anyone who lived before we were born was in some peculiar way a different kind of human being from any we have come in contact with in our own lifetime. This concept must be changed; we must realize in our bones that almost everything in time and history has changed except the human being."
9974,"If you want a bourgeois existence, you shouldn't be an actor. You're in the wrong profession."
9975,"Once in a while, there's stuff that makes me say, That's what theatre's about. It has to be a human event on the stage, and that doesn't happen very often."
9976,Keep pace with the present. Take a trip to the moon. envision the future.
9977,The need to be loved and protected is at a peak when we feel abandoned and are particularly vulnerable to difficult circumstances.
9978,"We were not allowed to say, Screw, but we could say, Hump the hostess, because hump is in Shakespeare."
9979,I love going to the movies; I love watching good movie actors. They must know something I don't.
9980,"It must be noted that it is often the colleague or direct disciple of a new thinker who gets stuck in literal interpretations of the work, tending to freeze the new ideas and language into an inflexible, static condition."
9981,I love playing Chekhov. That's the hardest; that's why I love it most.
9982,We had a relationship that lasted 44 years. Herbert and I lived together 10 years before we were married. He always gave me a little heart for whatever anniversary.
9983,I have disassociated myself from that book.
9984,"I think, by and large, the level of acting is mediocre. When I go to the theatre, I get so angry. I don't go."

9986,I won't go to England because they won't let my dog in.
9987,"You are about to be told one more time that you are America's most valuable natural resource. Have you seen what they do to valuable natural resources?! Have you seen a strip mine? Have you seen a clear cut in the forest? Have you seen a polluted river? Don't ever let them call you a valuable natural resource! They're going to strip mine your soul. They're going to clear cut your best thoughts for the sake of profit unless you learn to resist, because the profit system follows the path of least resistance and following the path of least resistance is what makes the river crooked!"
9988,The Earth is not dying-it is being killed. And the people who are killing it have names and addresses.
9989,"Kids don't have a little brother working in the coal mine, they don't have a little sister coughing her lungs out in the looms of the big mill towns of the Northeast. Why? Because we organized; we broke the back of the sweatshops in this country; we have child labor laws. Those were not benevolent gifts from enlightened management. They were fought for, they were bled for, they were died for by working people, by people like us. Kids ought to know that."
9990,"The state can't give you freedom, and the state can't take it away. You're born with it, like your eyes, like your ears. Freedom is something you assume, then you wait for someone to try to take it away. The degree to which you resist is the degree to which you are free."
9991,The degree to which you resist is the degree to which you are free.
9992,"Time is an enormous, long river, and I’m standing in it, just as you’re standing in it. My elders are the tributaries, and everything they thought and every struggle they went through and everything they gave their lives to, and every song they created, and every poem that they laid down flows down to me – and if I take the time to ask, and if I take the time to see, and if I take the time to reach out, I can build that bridge between my world and theirs. I can reach down into that river and take out what I need to get through this world"
9993,"I said, ""OK, Ammon [Hennacy], I will try that."" He said, ""You came into the world armed to the teeth. With an arsenal of weapons, weapons of privilege, economic privilege, sexual privilege, racial privilege. You want to be a pacifist, you're not just going to have to give up guns, knives, clubs, hard, angry words, you are going to have lay down the weapons of privilege and go into the world completely disarmed."""
9994,The most un-American thing you can do is to stifle dissent
9995,Every good educator knows that true teaching is to teach kids how to ask the right questions.
9996,"Children, be worried when they call you America's most valuable natural resource. Have you seen what they've done to the other natural resources?"
9997,"I'm here to change the world, and if I am not, I am probably wasting my time."
9998,"When I went to high school - that's about as far as I got - reading my U.S. history textbook, well, I got the history of the ruling class.  I got the history of the generals and the industrialists and the presidents that didn't get caught.  How 'bout you?  I got all of the history of the people who owned the wealth of the country, but none of the history of the people that created it."
9999,"But if it’s true that the only true life I had was the life of my brain, what sense does it make to hand that brain to somebody for eight hours a day for their particular use on the presumption that, at the end of the day, they will give it back in an unmutilated condition? Fat chance!"

Which is to say, if you want something done, don't come to me to do it for you; you got to get together and figure out how to do it yourselves. Is that a deal?"
10003,"My pacifism came after I joined the army and was shipped over to Korea. There was a little one-room orphanage there called Song-do. There were 180 babies in there, and they were GI babies. The U.S. government would not acknowledge this, and the Korean government had nothing to do with them. They were living on a 100-pound bag of rice a month. Some of those kids, when they were old enough, would go out and shine shoes. They would show up at the gate of our compound to shine shoes, and you'd swear they were looking for their fathers."
10004,"They're going to clear cut your best thoughts for the sake of profit unless you learn to resist, because the profit system follows the path of least resistance and following the path of least resistance is what makes the river crooked!"
10005,"Folk music isn't owned by anybody. It is owned by everybody, like the national parks, the postal system, and the school system. It's our common property. There is nobody's name on it. Nobody can make money on it. It's not copywritten."
10006,Chris Chandler is the best performance poet I have ever seen.

10017,If anyone stumbles then he must repent. If anyone errs then he must repent. And no one must insist on (the path of) destruction. If anyone insists on tyranny then he is far away from the path
10018,Take note of the fact that I am a follower (of the religion) and not an innovator.
10019,"If our hearts were truly pure, we would never have our fill of the words of your Lord"

10021,
10022,"In nature's economy the currency is not money, it is life."
10023,"We share this planet, our home, with millions of species. Justice and sustainability both demand that we do not use more resources than we need."
10024,"I do not allow myself to be overcome by hopelessness, no matter how tough the situation. I believe that if you just do your little bit without thinking of the bigness of what you stand against, if you turn to the enlargement of your own capacities, just that itself creates new potential."
10025,"Diversity creates harmony, and harmony creates beauty, balance, bounty and peace in nature and society, in agriculture and culture, in science and in politics."
10026,Uniformity is not nature's way; diversity is nature's way.

10030,"The liberation of the earth, the liberation of women, the liberation of all humanity is the next step of freedom we need to work for, and it's the next step of peace that we need to create."
10031,"An organic farmer is the best peacemaker today, because there is more violence, more death, more destruction, more wars, through a violent industrial agricultural system. And to shift away from that into an agriculture of peace is what organic farming is doing."
10032,It is not an investment if it destroys the planet
10033,"I think the American people should see that the corporations abandoned them long ago. That people will have to build their own economies and rebuild democracy as a living democracy. The corporations belong to no land, no country, no people. They have no loyalty to anything apart from the base-line - their profits. And the profits today are on an unimaginable scale; it has become illegitimate, criminal profit - profits extracted at the cost of life."
10034,"We've moved from wisdom to knowledge, and now we're moving from knowledge to information, and that information is so partial – that we're creating incomplete human beings."
10035,You are not Atlas carrying the world on your shoulder. It is good to remember that the planet is carrying you.
10036,I think what we owe each other is a celebration of life and to replace fear and hopelessness with fearlessness and joy.
10037,Nature shrinks as capital grows. The growth of the market cannot solve the very crisis it creates.
10038,"Genetic engineering has never been about saving the world, it's about controlling the world."
10039,"A single, one-dimensional way of thinking has created a monoculture of the mind. And the monoculture of the mind has become a self-fulfilling prophecy. This is the root of why we have pitted equity against ecology and sustainability against justice."
10040,"The primary threat to nature and people today comes from centralising and monopolising power and control. Not until diversity is made the logic of production will there be a chance for sustainability, justice and peace. Cultivating and conserving diversity is no luxury in our times: it is a survival imperative."
10041,"In traditional agriculture, the soil is the mother. She's the mother who gives, to whom you must give back."
10042,"I believe that we will see a lot of destruction, but I believe that if we can see the right patterns and draw the right lessons from that destruction, we might be able to rebuild before it's too late. And then I have that ultimate optimism that even if we can't, life will rebuild itself. In a way, the global economy might collapse, but Gaia won't, and people's ingenuity won't. We will rebuild society, we will rebuild local economies, we will rebuild human aspirations."
10043,"Earth Democracy connects people in circles of care, cooperation, and compassion instead of dividing them through competition and conflict, fear and hatred."
10044,"In the seed and the soil, we find the answers to every one of the crises we face. The crises of violence and war. The crises of hunger and disease. The crisis of the destruction of democracy."
10045,"When the forest is destroyed, when the river is dammed, when the biodiversity is stolen, when fields are waterlogged or turned saline because of economic activities, it is a question of survival for these people. So our environmental movements have been justice movements."
10046,

10050,"When you have a passion for something then you tend not only to be better at it, but you work harder at it too."

10052,"When you love something, every day goes by in 10 minutes."
10053,I never thought I'd be successful. It seems in my own mind that in everything I've undertaken I've never quite made the mark. But I've always been able to put disappointments aside. Success isn't about the end result; it's about what you learn along the way.
10054,"The key is falling in love with something, anything. If your heart's attached to it, then your mind will be attached to it."
10055,It's a remarkable exercise to sit and look at your own work over the years.
10056,"Every woman hates her own body. I don't know a woman who doesn't . . . well, I do know a few who love themselves but in the case of most women it's like, ""ugh."" And when I dress a woman, my design intention is to give them an attitude or a grace, no matter whether it's a wedding gown or ready-to-wear."

10059,Fashion offers no greater challenge than finding what works for night without looking like you are wearing a costume.
10060,"Fashion to me has become very disposable; I wanted to get back to craft, to clothes that could last."
10061,A bride should look at everything she possibly can...just so she can experiment and see what makes her really feel beautiful or glamorous or classical or whatever she desires to be on that particular day.
10062,I've always tried to push myself technically and to push myself visually. That's been part of the journey.
10063,"I see myself as a true modernist. Even when I do a traditional gown, I give it a modern twist. I go to the past for research. I need to know what came before so I can break the rules."
10064,I love a black wedding dress.
10065,I see myself as an arbiter of taste.
10066,It's hard to balance everything. It's always challenging.
10067,"When I design a wedding dress with a bustle, it has to be one the bride can dance in. I love the idea that something is practical and still looks great."
10068,"Although in skating you compete with other people, anyone who achieves a certain level of success is first and foremost competing against themselves. And for me the idea that I could always do better, learn more, learn faster, is something that came from skating. But I carried that with me for the rest of my life."
10069,I am not the sort of woman who would wear high heels with a bathing suit. Let's get that straight right now.

10078,
10079,"You cannot stop destructive actions by others, but you can stop your own destructive reactions to them"
10080,"We never get upset over what happens. Never. We get upset because of preconceived ideas as to what we think should happen, what we want to happen. When our preference clashes with the reality, we get hurt. Rid yourself of all preconceived ideas as to what should happen. You are then at peace whatever happens."
10081,"Do not be impatient with your seemingly slow progress. Do not try to run faster than you presently can. If you are studying, reflecting and trying, you are making progress whether you are aware of it or not. A traveler walking the road in the darkness of night is still going forward. Someday, some way, everything will break open, like the natural unfolding of a rosebud."
10082,Our freedom can be measured by the number of things we can walk away from.
10083,"It is a thousand times more sensible to climb one foot up the 
 mountainside than to chatter for years about the mountaintop."
10084,"No one on earth can hurt you, unless you accept the hurt in your own mind. . . The problem is not other people; it is your reaction."
10085,How would you feel if you had no fear? Feel like that. How would you behave toward other people if you realized their powerlessness to hurt you? Behave like that. How would your react to so-called misfortune if you saw its inability to bother you? React like that. How would you think toward yourself if you knew you were really all right? Think like that.
10086,See human nonsense as nonsense and save years of trying to make sense out of it.
10087,Be teachable. That is the whole secret.

10089,A truly strong person does not need the approval of others any more than a lion needs the approval of sheep.
10090,"Anger or bitterness toward those who have hurt you will block your path to higher ground. You can have anger toward people or you can have freedom from people, but you can't have both."
10091,Happiness is not the acquisition of anything; it's the understanding of something.
10092,You can not escape a prison if you do not know you're in one.
10093,"Whenever encountering a troublesome person, do not identify him as being cruel or stupid or rude or anything else like that. Instead, see him as a frightened person."
10094,"When you are genuinely strong, you neither attack nor defend and so retain your energy."
10095,"Suppose you stand on a high place to enjoy the beauty of the sparkling sea below. You need do nothing to create that beauty; you need only BE IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE IT IS, and let nature do the rest. So it is with the inner life. There is nothing we can DO to gain psychic beauty. It already exists without our effort. We need only be where we belong, that is, in self-union. Then, beauty IS."
10096,"A chief cause of unhappiness is what I call mental movies. Mental movies are a misuse of the imagination. You know how it goes. You have a painful experience with someone, then run it over and over in your mind. You visualize what you said, what he did, how you both felt. As awful as it is, you feel compelled to repeat the film day and night. It is as if you were locked inside a theatre playing a horrible movie."
10097,"Truth does not really hurt, rather it is our resistance to its message that causes us pain."

10099,"The outer storm ceases the moment the inner storm ends, for they are the same storm."

10101,"Don't try to be spiritual. That is only a word in the dictionary. Make it your goal to become a normally functioning individual. Let these principles shape you according to your real nature of a simple, decent, honest, unafraid human being."
10102,
10103,"I've reached a point in my life where it's the little things that matter... I was always a rebel and probably could have got much farther had I changed my attitude. But when you think about it, I got pretty far without changing attitudes. I'm happier with that."
10104,I will have one of the cleanest obits of any actress. I never did cheesecake like Ann Sheridan or Betty Grable. I just used my hair.
10105,"There's no doubt I was a bit of a misfit in the Hollywood of the forties. The race for glamour left me far behind. I didn't really want to keep up. I wanted my stardom without the usual trimmings. Because of this, I was branded a rebel at the very least. But I don't regret that for a minute. My appetite was my own and I simply wouldn't have it any other way."
10106,You could put all the talent I had into your left eye and still not suffer from impaired vision.

10109,"I think I've developed into an actress because I've worked darn hard at it and I've learned a great deal from a lot of gifted people. And if I have nothing else to show for my life, apart from a scrapbook full of cuttings, I have the knowledge that my early days in Hollywood weren't in vain."
10110,Alan Ladd was a marvelous person in his simplicity. In so many ways we were kindred spirits. We both were professionally conceived through Hollywood's search for box office and the types to insure the box office. And we were both little people. Alan wasn't as short as most people believe. It was true that in certain films Alan would climb a small platform or the girl worked in a slit trench. We had no such problems together.

10112,"Change, like healing, takes time."
10113,"Maybe there's more we all could have done, but we just have to let the guilt remind us to do better next time."
10114,A brave man acknowledges the strength of others.

10125,The truth has a way of changing people's plans.
10126,"Every faction conditions its members to think and act a certain way. And most people do it. For most people, it's not hard to learn, to find a pattern of thought that works and stay that way. But our minds move in a dozen different directions. We can't be confined to one way of thinking, and that terrifies our leaders. It means we can't be controlled. And it means that no matter what they do, we will always cause trouble for them."
10127,"Sorry, am I being rude?"" she asks. ""I'm used to saying whatever is on my mind. Mom used to say that politeness is deception in pretty packaging"
10128,"There are so many ways to be brave in this world. Sometimes it involves giving up everything you have ever known, or everyone you have ever loved for the sake of something greater."
10129,Sometimes drastic change requires drastic measures.
10130,"There is always somthing to learn, always somthing that is important to understand"

10164,"Every person you see has stories, and every person you see has a few that would break your heart. We deserve each other's respect simply because we've survived all we have and kept going anyway."
10165,"If you celebrate your differentness, the world will, too. It believes exactly what you tell it-through the words you use to describe yourself, the actions you take to care for yourself, and the choices you make to express yourself. Tell the world you are one-of-a-kind creation who came here to experience wonder and spread joy. Expect to be accommodated."
10166,"A simple life is not seeing how little we can get by with-that's poverty-but how efficiently we can put first things first. . . . When you're clear about your purpose and your priorities, you can painlessly discard whatever does not support these, whether it's clutter in your cabinets or commitments on your calendar. (148)"
10167,"To the people who love you, you are beautiful already. This is not because they're blind to your shortcomings but because they so clearly see your soul. Your shortcomings then dim by comparison. The people who care about you are willing to let you be imperfect and beautiful, too."

10171,"My calling, as one imperfect human, is to celebrate and uphold life every time I get the chance."
10172,Your mission isn't a project to check off your list. It's a commitment to which to dedicate your life.
10173,"If you don't accept yourself, you won't live fully, and if you don't live fully you'll need to get full some other way."
10174,"In terms of days and moments lived, you'll never again be as young as you are right now, so spend this day, the youth of your future, in a way that deflects regret. Invest in yourself. Have some fun. Do something important. Love somebody extra. In one sense, you're just a kid, but a kid with enough years on her to know that every day is priceless."
10175,"If you only knew who you really are, you'd be starstruck"
10176,Sometimes we get so busy pursuing our dream that we forget to notice the degree to which we're living it already.
10177,"Follow the tugs in your heart. I think that everybody gets these gentle urges and should listen to them. Even if they sound absolutely insane, they may be worth going for."
10178,"The idea that everything is purposeful really changes the way you live. To think that everything that you do has a ripple effect, that every word that you speak, every action that you make affects other people and the planet."
10179,"Self-esteem is the result of recognizing our personal power; awe and wonder come from recognizing our lack of it.  Both are true, and in an exceptional life there is no conflict between them."
10180,"I need a spiritual connection - I can make changes, but I can't make miracles - and I need people around me who'll support me and believe in me and tell me the truth and not let me deceive myself into avoiding the what's scary and hard and necessary."
10181,"If you celebrate your differentness, the world will, too. It believes exactly what you tell it."
10182,"Look for your brushes with the divine.  Be receptive to them.  When heaven knocks, open the door.  Value these visits.  Remember them.  Expect more of them."
10183,"Compassion in action may be the glorious possibility that could protect our crowded, polluted planet."
10184,"The strongest animals on earth are plant eaters. Every creature we've enlisted to do the work we couldn't handle - the horse, donkey, elephant, camel, water buffalo, ox, yak - is an herbivore... whose huge muscles were built from plant protein, and whose strong bones got that way, and stayed that way, from grazing on grass and eating other vegetables."
10185,"That old saying about opportunity only knocking once is as archaic as the flat-earth theory and as patently untrue.  Opportunity knocks all the time - and it rings your doorbell, calls you up, and sends you e-mails."
10186,"We do children an enormous disservice when we assume that they cannot appreciate anything beyond drive through fare and nutritionally marginal, kid-targeted convenience foods. Our children are capable of consuming something that grew in a garden or on a tree and never saw a deep fryer. They are capable of making it through diner at a sit-down restaurant with tablecloths and no climbing equipment. Children deserve quality nourishment."
10187,
10188,"Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation."
10189,When we are no longer able to change a situation - we are challenged to change ourselves.
10190,"Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her own life."
10191,"We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."
10192,"When a person can’t find a deep sense of meaning, they distract themselves with pleasure."
10193,"Life is never made unbearable by circumstances, but only by lack of meaning and purpose."
10194,"Decisions, not conditions, determine what a man is."
10195,"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."
10196,"Success, like happiness, is the unexpected side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself."
10197,The one thing you can't take away from me is the way I choose to respond to what you do to me.
10198,"Our greatest human freedom is that, despite whatever our physical situation is in life, WE ARE ALWAYS FREE TO CHOOSE OUR THOUGHTS!"
10199,The meaning of my life is to help others find meaning in theirs.
10200,"Ever more people today have the means to live, but no meaning to live for."
10201,"We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed. For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one's predicament into a human achievement. When we are no longer able to change a situation-just think of an incurable disease such as inoperable cancer-we are challenged to change ourselves."
10202,What is to give light must endure burning.
10203,Our greatest freedom is the freedom to choose our attitude.
10204,"Don't aim at success — the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long run — in the long run, I say — success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it."
10205,Every human being has the freedom to change at any instant.
10206,"In times of crisis, people reach for meaning. Meaning is strength. Our survival may depend on our seeking and finding it."
10207,"Each of us carries a unique spark of the divine, and each of us is also an inseparable part of the web of life."
10208,"To be sure, man's search for meaning may arouse inner tension rather than inner equilibrium. However, precisely such tension is an indispensable prerequisite of mental health. There is nothing in the world, I venture to say, that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the knowledge that there is a meaning in one's life. There is much wisdom in the words of Nietzsche: ""He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how"
10209,The quest for meaning is the key to mental health and human flourishing
10210,"It isn't the past which holds us back, it's the future; and how we undermine it, today."
10211,"Live as if you were living a second time, and as though you had acted wrongly the first time."
10212,
10213,Remember that nutrition is 90%; exercise is 10%.
10214,"Eat for nutrition and food value. Emphasize natural foods, avoid processed foods and eliminate junk entirely."
10215,Size without shape is grotesque.
10216,Bodybuilding is 80% nutrition!
10217,
10218,"The Winner is always part of the answer.
The Loser is always part of the problem.
The Winner always has a program.
The Loser always has an excuse.
The Winner says, ""Let me do it for you.""
The Loser says, ""That's not my job.""
The Winner sees an answer for every problem.
The Loser sees a problem for every answer.
The Winner sees a green near every sand trap
The Loser sees two or three sand traps near every green.
The Winner says, ""It may be difficult but it's possible.""
The Loser says, ""It might be possible but it's too difficult.""
Be a Winner."
10219,
10220,"If you are not making mistakes, you are not trying hard enough."
10221,
10222,"The challenge of every team is to build a feeling of oneness, of dependence on one another because the question is usually not how well each person performs, but how well they work together."
10223,
10224,The man on top of the mountain didn't fall there.
10225,The measure of who we are is what we do with what we have.
10226,"The price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand."
10227,"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. Every job is a self portrait of the person who did it ... Autograph your work with excellence."
10228,"Winning is not a sometime thing; it's an all time thing. You don't win once in a while, you don't do things right once in a while, you do them right all the time. Winning is habit. Unfortunately, so is losing."
10229,"True perfection is unattainable, but if you chase perfection you will catch excellence!"
10230,Everyone Has A Will To Win But Very Few Have The Will To Prepare To Win
10231,"I firmly believe that any man's finest hour, the greatest fulfillment of all that he holds dear, is that moment when he has worked his heart out in a good cause and lies exhausted on the field of battle - victorious."
10232,We will be relentless in our pursuit for perfection. We won't ever be perfect - but in the process we will achieve greatness.
10233,"Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work."
10234,
10235,"The man who wins, is the man who thinks he can."
10236,
10237,"It's not whether you get knocked down, it's whether you get up."
10238,"One's desire, not ability, determines success."
10239,"You carry on no matter what are the obstacles. You simply refuse to give up - and, when the going gets tough, you get tougher. And, you win."
10240,The achievements of an organization are the results of the combined effort of each individual.
10241,"If you are five minutes early, you are already ten minutes late."
10242,
10243,
10244,"Great things do not just happen by impulse, 
 but as a succession of small things linked together."
10245,Art is to console those who are broken by life.
10246,"If you hear a voice within you say 'you cannot paint,' then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced."
10247,Doing little things well is a step toward doing big things better.
10248,If one truly loves nature one finds beauty everywhere.
10249,"Your profession is not what brings home your weekly paycheck, your profession is what you're put here on earth to do, with such passion and such intensity that it becomes spiritual in calling."
10250,"I put my heart and my soul into my work, and have lost my mind in the process."
10251,"Close friends are truly life's treasures. Sometimes they know us better than we know ourselves. With gentle honesty, they are there to guide and support us, to share our laughter and our tears. Their presence reminds us that we are never really alone."
10252,"Find things beautiful as much as you can, most people find too little beautiful."
10253,
10254,"The heart of man is very much like the sea, it has its storms, it has its tides and in its depths it has its pearls too"

10258,What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything?
10259,"I confess I do not know why, but looking at the stars always makes me dream."
10260,Color in a picture is like enthusiasm in life.
10261,
10262,"What am I in the eyes of most people - a nonentity, an eccentric, or an unpleasant person - somebody who has no position in society and will never have; in short, the lowest of the low. All right, then - even if that were absolutely true, then I should one day like to show by my work what such an eccentric, such a nobody, has in his heart."
10263,"The fishermen know that the sea is dangerous and the storm terrible, but they have never found these dangers sufficient reason for remaining ashore."

10266,Success is sometimes the outcome of a whole string of failures.

10271,"When you pray, God puts people in your life to lead you when you cannot lead yourself."
10272,Do not live someone else's life and someone else's idea of what womanhood is. Womanhood is you. Womanhood is everything that's inside of you.
10273,You can't be hesitant about who you are.
10274,I don't have any time to stay up all night worrying about what someone who doesn't love me has to say about me.

10277,"Every artist, true artist, struggles with an overwhelming sense of feeling like you're not worthy."
10278,"There's not one woman in America who does not care about her hair, but we give it way too much value. We deprive ourselves of things, we use it to destroy each other, we'll look at a child and judge a mother and her sense of motherhood by the way the child's hair looks. I am not going to traumatize my child about her hair. I want her to love her hair."
10279,Let me tell you something: The only thing that separates women of color from anyone else is opportunity. You cannot win an Emmy for roles that are simply not there.
10280,All you really need to do is shift people just a tiny bit for change to happen. It doesn't have to be huge and humongous.
10281,"As an artist, you've got to see the mess. That's what we do. We get a human being, and it's like putting together a puzzle. And the puzzle has got to be a mixture, a multifaceted mixture of human emotions, and not all of it is going to be pretty."
10282,"I would love to be remembered as a person who used her life to inspire others in any way, shape or form."
10283,"I’m a black woman who is from Central Falls, Rhode Island. I’m dark skinned. I’m quirky. I’m shy. I’m strong. I’m guarded. I’m weak at times. I’m sensual. I’m not overtly sexual. I am so many things in so many ways and I will never see myself on screen. And the reason I will never see myself up on screen is because that does not translate with being black."
10284,"You have two stark choices when you find yourself in a really desperate situation. You can either fold and cave-in to it or you can become really passionate about getting out of it. When you're really passionate, you're going to grab hold of every rope you see, and wrap them around your arms and legs to claw your way out. And that's the way I've felt in my life."
10285,The only thing that separates women of color from everyone else is opportunity.
10286,Creativity only resonates if you infuse real life into the work.
10287,"They say, 'To serve is to love,' and I think to serve is to heal, too."
10288,Relationships change us and make us grow.
10289,"At the end of the day, nobody can tell you how to tackle failure or how to handle change. The world is very good at encouraging you to go along with the status quo and at basking in your successes."
10290,"But the biggest beauty advice I've given my daughter is every morning I say, ""Genesis, what are the two best parts of you?"" And she says ""my brain and my heart."" And I say, ""You've gotta remember that, Genesis. You've gotta remember that you're not what you look like,"" you know? I think that's the best beauty advice I could give her."
10291,I think that you always want to gravitate towards people who absolutely are great at what they do and go for authenticity.
10292,"There are five freedoms:
The freedom to see and hear what is;
The freedom to say what you feel and think;
The freedom to feel what you actually feel;
The freedom to ask for what you want;
The freedom to take risks on your own behalf."
10293,"I want to love you without clutching, appreciate you without judging, join you without invading, invite you without demanding, leave you without guilt, criticize you without blaming, and help you without insulting. If I can have the same from you, then we can truly meet and enrich each other."
10294,"I want you to get excited about who you are, what you are, what you have, and what can still be for you. I want to inspire you to see that you can go far beyond where you are right now."
10295,Life is not what it's supposed to be. It's what it is. The way you cope with it is what makes the difference.
10296,We get together on the basis of our similarities; we grow on the basis of our differences.
10297,"Feelings of worth can flourish only in an atmosphere where individual differences are appreciated, mistakes are tolerated, communication is open, and rules are flexible - the kind of atmosphere that is found in a nurturing family."
10298,Communication is to relationships what breath is to life.
10299,We must not allow other people's limited perceptions to define us.
10300,Your responses to the events of life are more important than the events themselves.
10301,"I believe the greatest gift I can conceive of having from anyone is to be seen by them, heard by them, to be understood and touched by them."
10302,We need 4 hugs a day for survival. We need 8 hugs a day for maintenance. We need 12 hugs a day for growth.
10303,People prefer the certainty of misery to the misery of uncertainty
10304,"It is now clear to me that the family is a microcosm of the world. To understand the world, we can study the family: issues such as power, intimacy, autonomy, trust, and communication skills are vital parts underlying how we live in the world. To change the world is to change the family."
10305,"Every word, facial expression, gesture, or action on the part of a parent gives the child some message about self-worth. It is sad that so many parents don't realize what messages they are sending."
10306,The message sent is not always the message received.
10307,The Problem is never the problem! It is only a symptom of something much deeper.
10308,"The symbol in Chinese for crisis is made up of two ideographs: one means danger, the other means opportunity. This symbol is a reminder that we can choose to turn a crisis into an opportunity or into a negative experience."
10309,"Taste everything, but swallow only what fits."
10310,"I regard (parenting) as the hardest, most complicated, anxiety-ridden, sweat-and-blood-producing job in the world. Succeeding requires the ultimate in patience, common sense, commitment, humor, tact, love, wisdom, awareness, and knowledge. At the same time, it holds the possibility for the most rewarding, joyous experience of a lifetime, namely, that of being successful guides to a new and unique human being."
10311,"As a therapist, I am a companion. I try to help people tune into their own wisdom."
10312,"I own me, and therefore, I can engineer me. I am me, and I am Okay."
10313,Many people are living in an emotional jail without realizing it.
10314,I give life to that which I notice. What I don't notice dies.
10315,Problems are not the problem; coping is the problem.
10316,"Over the years I have developed a picture of what a human being living humanely is like. She is a person who understand, values and develops her body, finding it beautiful and useful; a person who is real and is willing to take risks, to be creative, to manifest competence, to change when the situation calls for it, and to find ways to accommodate to what is new and different, keeping that part of the old that is still useful and discarding what is not."
10317,
10318,A self that goes on changing is a self that goes on living.
10319,

10322,"How lovely goodness is in those who, stepping lightly, go smiling through the world."
10323,
10324,The eyes of others our prisons; their thoughts our cages.
10325,A feminist is any woman who tells the truth about her life
10326,"For it would seem - her case proved it - that we write, not with the fingers, but with the whole person. The nerve which controls the pen winds itself about every fibre of our being, threads the heart, pierces the liver."
10327,There is the strange power we have of changing facts by the force of the imagination.
10328,"I am rooted, but I flow."
10329,"Be truthful, and the result is bound to be amazingly interesting."
10330,"Let us simmer over our incalculable cauldron, our enthralling confusion, our hotchpotch of impulses, our perpetual miracle - for the soul throws up wonders every second. Movement and change are the essence of our being; rigidity is death; conformity is death; let us say what comes into our heads, repeat ourselves, contradict ourselves, fling out the wildest nonsense, and follow the most fantastic fancies without caring what the world does or thinks or says. For nothing matters except life."
10331,Just in case you ever foolishly forget; I'm never not thinking of you
10332,"For beyond the difficulty of communicating oneself, there is the supreme difficulty of being oneself."
10333,If you do not tell the truth about yourself you cannot tell it about other people.
10334,"Until we can comprehend the beguiling beauty of a single flower, we are woefully unable to grasp the meaning and potential of life itself."
10335,One must learn to be silent just as one must learn to talk.
10336,"It is fatal to be a man or woman pure and simple: one must be a woman manly, or a man womanly."
10337,"The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark."
10338,A light here required a shadow there.
10339,I am made and remade continually. Different people draw different words from me.
10340,"In solitude we give passionate attention to our lives, to our memories, to the details around us."
10341,"How much better is silence; the coffee cup, the table. How much better to sit by myself like the solitary sea-bird that opens its wings on the stake. Let me sit here for ever with bare things, this coffee cup, this knife, this fork, things in themselves, myself being myself."
10342,
10343,People who are very beautiful make their own laws.
10344,My birth sign is Scorpio and they eat themselves up and burn themselves out. I swing between happiness and misery. I am part prude and part nonconformist. I say what I think and I don't pretend and I am prepared to accept the consequences of my actions.
10345,"I'm not a film star; I am an actress. Being a film star is such a false life, lived for fake values and for publicity."
10346,Sometimes I dread the truth of the lines I say. But the dread must never show.
10347,"I cannot let well enough alone. I get restless. I have to be doing different things. I am a very impatient person and headstrong. If I've made up my mind to do something, I can't be persuaded out of it."
10348,Life is too short to work so hard.
10349,It's much easier to make people cry than to laugh.
10350,Scarlett: You should die of shame to leave me here alone and helpless. Rhett: You helpless? (laughs) Heaven help the Yankees if they capture you.
10351,I'm not young. What's wrong with that?
10352,"I realize that the memories I cherish most are not the first night successes, but of simple, everyday things: walking through our garden in the country after rain; sitting outside a cafe in Provence, drinking the vin de pays; staying at a little hotel in an English market town with Larry, in the early days after our marriage, when he was serving in the Fleet Air Arm, and I was touring Scotland, so that we had to make long treks to spend weekends together."
10353,"When I come into the theatre I get a sense of security. I love an audience. I love people, and I act because I like trying to give pleasure to people."
10354,Things are simple when you're going to die.
10355,I loved fencing and dancing and elocution.
10356,"Comedy is much more difficult than tragedy-and a much better training, I think. It's much easier to make people cry than to make them laugh."
10357,I've always been mad about cats.
10358,"In Britain, an attractive woman is somehow suspect. If there is talent as well, it is overshadowed. Beauty and brains just can't be entertained; someone has been too extravagant. This does not happen in America or on the Continent, for the looks of a woman are considered a positive advertisement for her gifts and don't detract from them."
10359,"But I remember the morning after The Mask of Virtue-which is the first play I did at the West End-that some critics saw fit to be as foolish as to say that I was a great actress. And I thought, that was a foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry. And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said-for those first notices. I find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well, and have never forgiven him."
10360,I will not be ignored.
10361,"Dear Lord, I'm so grateful I'm still loved."
10362,"Having lost Rhett, she can always return to the land - to Tara, to soak up its strength. . . . Tara! . . . Home. I'll go home, and I'll think of some way to get him back! After all, tomorrow is another day!"
10363,"I think Edith Evans is the most marvelous actress in the world and she can look beautiful. People who aren't beautiful can look beautiful. She can look as beautiful as Diana Cooper, who was the most beautiful woman in the world."
10364,"You know the passage where Scarlett voices her happiness that her mother is dead, so that she can't see what a bad girl Scarlett has become? Well, that's me."
10365,I have just made out my will and given all the things I have and many that I haven't.
10366,"I don't know what that Method is. Acting is life, to me, and should be."
10367,
10368,My clothes have a story. They have an identity. They have a character and a purpose. That's why they become classics. Because they keep on telling a story. They are still telling it.
10369,"I'm not trying to do something different, I'm trying to do the same thing but in a different way"
10370,"Buy less. Choose well. Make it last. Quality, not quantity. Everybody's buying far too many clothes."
10371,You have a more interesting life if you wear impressive clothes.
10372,"You've got to invest in the world, you've got to read, you've got to go to art galleries, you've got to find out the names of plants. You've got to start to love the world and know about the whole genius of the human race. We're amazing people."
10373,The best fashion accessory is a book.
10374,"It's a philosophy of life. A practice. If you do this, something will change, what will change is that you will change, your life will change, and if you can change you, you can perhaps change the world."
10375,The fight is no longer between the classes or between rich and poor but between the idiots and the eco-conscious.
10376,"Buy less, choose well: that's the maxim. Quality not quantity. That's the most environmentally friendly thing you can do."
10377,I design things to help people to hopefully express their personality.
10378,"Fashion is very important. It is life-enhancing and, like everything that gives pleasure, it is worth doing well."

10908,It doesn't matter what you're trying to accomplish. It's all a matter of discipline. I was determined to discover what life held for me beyond the inner-city streets.

10923,"When you're 20 you care what everyone thinks, when you're 40 you stop caring what everyone thinks, when you're 60 you realize no one was ever thinking about you in the first place. You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life."

10943,I had five great years at Liverpool and I would rather just keep that memory as it is.
10944,"I am still a Liverpool fan and will be forever, absolutely"
10945,I left Real Madrid for the same reason Di Maria did. We work hard but only others get the praise.
10946,We will have to go to win. There's no other option. We have one more match.
10947,"I tried to do everything just as I would before any other match, but it was impossible."
10948,"I've still got Paul Scholes' shirt at home which I swapped with him once. When I was at Liverpool he was one of the players I liked most. Maybe he's not valued as much as he should be in England because of the style of football there and because he keeps a low profile. Perhaps he would have been more valued in Spain, where midfielders like him form part of the 'ideal.' Fans in Spain rate him very highly and I admire him a huge amount."
10949,
10950,"I pass and I move, I help you, I look for you, I stop, I raise my head, I look and, above all, I open up the pitch...The one who has the ball, is the master of the game...Thats the school of Joan Vilà, of Albert Benaiges, of Johan Cruijff, of Pep Guardiola"
10951,"Some teams can't or don't pass the ball. What are you playing for? What's the point? That's not football. Combine, pass, play. That's football - for me, at least."
10952,There are two types of football - there's physical football and football talent.
10953,"In football, the result is an impostor. You can do things really, really well but not win. There's something greater than the result, more lasting - a legacy."
10954,"Favourite stadium? I have good memories of my CL debut at Old Trafford, spectacular atmosphere. The Theatre of Dreams, as they say."
10955,In the last 15 to 20 years the best central midfielder that I have seen - the most complete - is SCHOLES
10956,"In the last 15 to 20 years the best central midfielder that I have seen — the most complete — is Scholes. I have spoken with Xabi Alonso about this many times. Scholes is a spectacular player who has everything. He can play the final pass, he can score, he is strong, he never gets knocked off the ball and he doesn’t give possession away. If he had been Spanish then maybe he would have been valued more."
10957,"In futsal, you see whether a player is really talented. You notice the small details in quality, class and tactical understanding."
10958,"I'm a footballing romantic just like Johan Cruyff. We like football that is attractive, attacking and easy on the eye. When you win playing like this it's twice as satisfying. I've always played attacking football: my footballing ideals are very clear and well defined. I've grown up at Barcelona with that style and that's the one I like. I think it's good to win like that, by taking the initiative right from the off."
10959,Maybe one small regret is that I never got to play with Paul Scholes - but I was never going to leave Barcelona and he was never going to leave Manchester United.
10960,"In England, footballers are respected more, the game is more noble, there's less cheating. Every Spaniard who goes loves it - and comes back a better player. If I had ever left it would have been to England."
10961,"I've no regrets at all, but I still think at times that I would have loved to play in England. You live football over there; it's a great culture. People respect you more; it's more difficult to find respect in Spain. There is more criticism here."
10962,To me Paul is a role model. He is the best midfielder I've seen in the last 15 or 20 years.
10963,"Leo [Messi] is the best player of all time - better than Pele, Maradona or Cruyff. There have been some great teams in history - Pele's Brazil, Cruyff's Ajax, Sacchi's Milan - but in the past 20 years this Barcelona team is the best."
10964,"Celtic, like Barcelona, are more than a football club. Our clubs are a symbol of a culture and community that has not always been made welcome in their respective countries."
10965,"The atmosphere generated by the fans in Celtic's stadium for our visit was the most impressive I've ever witnessed. The grounds of Liverpool and Manchester United are good and the hostile feeling of playing against Real Madrid in the Bernabeu is also excellent, but the atmosphere against Celtic was the best."
10966,Iniesta is easily Spain's most complete player. He has everything.
10967,I liked the Paul Ince and Roy Keane partnership Manchester United had. They would have been my team had I moved to England.
10968,"Like so many of the players, I started at La Masia at the age of 11. I can't ever imagine not playing for Barcelona, let alone not playing soccer for a career. I don't ever want to play anywhere else."
10969,"I think Barcelona and the Spanish national team have been good for soccer because there are a lot of teams that come up playing from the back : with the goalie, the defense, moving up a defender to midfield, playing attacking soccer. I think fans want to see that. They want to see beautiful soccer, a spectacle, and Barcelona does that."
10970,I don't actually watch many shows. I will either watch movies or football. I enjoy to watch games in the Premier League and will also watch movies a lot as well. That is how I relax.
10971,If he continues like this then I think Messi will be the best player in the history of football.
10972,"The way I see it, Messi is the best player in history. He is the one who changes the course of games; he's the best. There is no comparison in my view; he's the world number one and by a margin."
10973,I'd love to play at Wembley. It's special for Barça - and for everyone in football.

10990,"The Ethiops say that their gods are flat-nosed and black,
 While the Thracians say that theirs have blue eyes and red hair.
 “If oxen and horses and lions had hands and were able to draw with their hands and do the same things as men, horses would draw the shapes of gods to look like horses and oxen would draw them to look like oxen, and each would make the gods' bodies have the same shape as they themselves had."
10991,"The Gods did not reveal, from the beginning, all things to us, but in the course of time through seeking we may learn & know things better. But as for certain truth no man knows it, nor shall he know it, neither of the Gods nor yet of all things that I speak. For even if by chance he were to utter The Final Truth, he would himself not know it: for all is but a woven web of guesses."
10992,"Even if a man should chance to speak the most complete truth, yet he himself does not know it; all things are wrapped in appearances"
10993,"There is one god, greatest among gods and men, who bears no similarity to humans either in shape or thought... but humans believe that the gods are born like themselves, and that the gods wear clothes and have bodies like humans and speak in the same way... but if cows and horses or lions had hands or could draw with the hands and manufacture the things humans can make, then horses would draw the forms of gods like horses, cows like cows, and they would make the gods' bodies resemble those which each kind of animal had itself."
10994,It isn't right to judge strength as better than good wisdom.
10995,"Pure truth no man has seen, nor ever shall know."
10996,Men always makes gods in their own image.

10998,But without effort [God] sets in motion all things by mind and thought.
10999,"No human being will ever know the truth, for even if they happen to say it by chance, they would not even know they had done so."
11000,"The clear and perfect truth no man has seen, nor will there be anyone who knows about the gods and what I say about all things...; for, however perfect what he says may be, yet he does not know it; all things are matters of opinion."
11001,"Homer and Hesiod attributed to the gods all things which are disreputable and worthy of blame when done by men; and they told of them many lawless deeds, stealing, adultery, and deception of each other."
11002,"God is one, supreme among gods and men, and not like mortals in body or in mind.The whole [of god] sees, the whole perceives, the whole hears. But without effort he sets in motion all things by mind and thought."
11003,"In the beginning the gods did not at all reveal all things clearly to mortals, but by searching men in the course of time find them out better."
11004,All men begin their learning with Homer.
11005,"If God had not made brown honey, men would think figs much sweeter than they do."
11006,"The sea is the source of water and the source of wind; for neither would blasts of wind arise in the clouds and blow out from within them, except for the great sea, nor would the streams of rivers nor the rain-water in the sky exist but for the sea ; but the great sea is the begetter of clouds and winds and rivers."
11007,"Ethiopians imagine their gods as black and snub-nosed; Thracians blue-eyed and red-haired. But if horses or lions had hands, or could draw and fashion works as men do, horses would draw the gods shaped like horses and lions like lions, making the gods resemble themselves."
11008,"This upper limit, of earth at our feet is visible and touches the air, but below it reaches to infinity"
11009,The sun comes into being each day from little pieces of fire that are collected.
11010,"If oxen and lions had hands and could paint with their hands and produce works of art, as men do, horses would paint the forms of the gods likes horses and oxen like oxen. Each would represent them with bodies according to the bodies of each. So the Ethiopians make their gods black and snub-nosed; the Thracians give theirs red hair and blue eyes."
11011,"People always say it's harder to heal a wounded heart than a wounded body. Bullshit. It's exactly the opposite—a wounded body takes much longer to heal. A wounded heart is nothing but ashes of memories. But the body is everything. The body is blood and veins and cells and nerves. A wounded body is when, after leaving a man you’ve lived with for three years, you curl up on your side of the bed as if there’s still somebody beside you. That is a wounded body: a body that feels connected to someone who is no longer there."

11015,"Never look back to the past, never regret, even if there is emptiness ahead.' But I couldn't help it. Sometimes I would rather look back if it meant that I could feel something in my heart, even something sad. Sadness was better than emptiness."
11016,I don't feel naked around you anymore.
11017,"I think our literary tradition has to evolve, has to explore its form and its spirit through writers and thinkers, rather than let the lazy, easy traditional narrative - which is controlled by the publishing industry - roll all over the readers and dominate the market. I think our readers and cinemagoers have been trained to read and watch very mainstream stuff. It's like being given sleeping pills. It sends people to a non-reflective sleep state."
11018,"I thought English is a strange language. Now I think French is even more strange. In France, their fish is poisson, their bread is pain, and their pancake is crepe. Pain and poison and crap. That's what they have every day."
11019,"I’m saying language is a passport. A dubious, dangerous passport too."
11020,"About time, what I really learned from studying English is: time is different with timing. I understand the difference of these two words so well. I understand falling in love with the right person in the wrong timing could be the greatest sadness in a person's entire life."
11021,"Self-censorship happens not only in China, or Iran or ex-Soviet places. It can happen anywhere. If an artist penetrates a certain taboo or a certain power through their work, he or she will face this problem. I'm always saying that commercial censorship is our foremost censorship globally today. Why do we still pretend we are free?"
11022,"It's not a choice. Either I write or I don't, especially when I'm in a foreign culture. I've lived in London for years, and I must continue my writing and filmmaking. The most important thing for an artist or an author is to continue her work. Languages and settings are the tools but not the first thing."
11023,"Huizi would say, never look back to the past. Never regret. Even if there is emptiness ahead, never look back."
11024,"But why people need privacy? Why privacy is important? In China, every family live together, grandparents, parents, daughter, son and their relatives too. Eat together and share everything, talk about everything. Privacy make people lonely. Privacy make family fallen apart."
11025,"Somehow, in the novel format, I don't really like to do upfront, ideological discussion. In my heart, literature remains a poetic and ambiguous medium. On the other hand, I trained as a documentary filmmaker in film school, so my films very much reflect reality and socio-political problems. They're less subtle I would say."
11026,"There was - there still is - a big shortage of good Chinese-English literary translators. So for two years in London, I was stuck waiting, not writing, with several Chinese books I couldn't get translated. That's when I decided to write in English, since I had been living here and had decided to reconstruct my life here. Even if I wrote in broken English, it was better than getting bored and weary and bitter on the long queue of authors waiting to be translated by a stranger."

11051,In today's society we sometimes forget to balance our hearts and our heads; this is the reason we stop laughing.
11052,"There is something to be learned from a rainstorm. When meeting with a sudden shower, you try not to get wet and run quickly along the road. But doing such things as passing under the eaves of houses, you still get wet. When you are resolved from the beginning, you will not be perplexed, though you will still get the same soaking. This understanding extends to everything."
11053,A warrior is worthless unless he rises above others and stands strong in the midst of a storm.

11055,"Nothing is impossible in this world. Firm determination, it is said, can move heaven and earth. Things appear far beyond one's power, because one cannot set his heart on any arduous project due to want of strong will."
11056,"Meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily. Every day when one’s body and mind are at peace, one should meditate upon being ripped apart by arrows, rifles, spears and swords, being carried away by surging waves, being thrown into the midst of a great fire, being struck by lightning, being shaken to death by a great earthquake, falling from thousand-foot cliffs, dying of disease or committing seppuku at the death of one’s master. And every day without fail one should consider himself as dead"

His deep affection for dragons was brought to the attention of the dragon god, and onde day a real dragon appeared before his window. It is said that he died of fright. He was probably a man who always spoke big words but acted differently when facing the real thing."

11074,"It is a good viewpoint to see the world as a dream. When you have something like a nightmare, you will wake up and tell yourself that it was only a dream. It is said that the world we live in is not a bit different from this."
11075,A real man does not think of victory or defeat. He plunges recklessly towards an irrational death.

11082,I have a fearless but neutral personality.
11083,I am so honored to be named as one of Time's 100 most influential people.
11084,I hope one day I will host my own charity event to give back to society.

11091,I love to show off my ability in a nice way.
11092,I'm very excited every time I'm at Augusta National. It's such a beautiful and fabulous golf course.
11093,"In golf, it's almost impossible to be perfect on each shot; that's the fun and challenge of golf."
11094,"Annika's my role model, and I wish in the future I could be like her."
11095,"It's hard to always be on top. You go down, you go up."
11096,"People are trying to grab every part of you, so it's really hard to focus."
11097,"I really want to thank Annika Sorenstam. She helped me a lot about my game, about the mentals, and she told me go step by step."
11098,I am very happy since when I am in different cities I can experience and learn different cultures!
11099,I will keep working hard!
11100,I think to be 'tough' means you look relaxed. So you have to be tough to win tournaments. But you don't want to be so tough on yourself.
11101,"When you play good, everything is good, but when you dont play so good, everything is bad. Even when you think there are good things, they still say bad things."
11102,
11103,Don’t worry about being good…. Aspire to be authentic.
11104,To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation.
11105,"I think art comes from some sense of discomfort with the world, some sense of not quite fitting with it."
11106,It's important in life to conclude things properly. Only then can you let go.
11107,"I can only tell my story, what you believe is up to you."
11108,"I suppose in the end, the whole of life becomes an act of letting go, but what always hurts the most is not taking a moment to say goodbye."
11109,"Just as music is noise that makes sense, a painting is colour that makes sense, so a story is life that makes sense."
11110,Reality is how we interpret it. Imagination and volition play a part in that interpretation. Which means that all reality is to some extent a fiction.
11111,"I had to stop hoping so much that a ship would rescue me. I should not count on outside help. Survival had to start with me. In my experience, a castaway’s worst mistake is to hope too much and to do too little. Survival starts by paying attention to what is close at hand and immediate. To look out with idle hope is tantamount to dreaming one’s life away."
11112,"Fiction and nonfiction are not so easily divided. Fiction may not be real, but it's true; it goes beyond the garland of facts to get to emotional and psychological truths. As for nonfiction, for history, it may be real, but its truth is slippery, hard to access, with no fixed meaning bolted to it. If history doesn't become story, it dies to everyone except the historian."
11113,Survival starts by paying attention to what is close at hand and immediate. To look out with idle hope is tantamount to dreaming one's life away.
11114,"It is true that those we meet can change us, sometimes so profoundly that we are not the same afterwards, even unto our names."

11116,"If literature does one thing, it makes you more empathetic by making you live other lives and feel the pain of others. Ideologues don't feel the pain of others because they haven't imaginatively got under their skins."
11117,"I must say a word about fear. It is life's only true opponent. Only fear can defeat life. It is a clever, treacherous adversary, how well I know. It has no decency, respects no law or convention, shows no mercy. It goes for your weakest spot, which it finds with unerring ease. It begins in your mind, always. One moment you are feeling calm, self-possessed, happy. Then fear, disguised in the garb of mild-mannered doubt, slips into your mind like a spy."
11118,"A realization that the founding principle of existence is what we call love, which works itself out sometimes not clearly, not cleanly, not immediately, nonetheless ineluctably."
11119,"If Christ spent an anguished night in prayer, if He burst out from the Cross, ""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"" then surely we are also permitted doubt. But we must move on. To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation."
11120,The presence of God is the finest of rewards.
11121,"If you stumble about believability, what are you living for? Love is hard to believe, ask any lover. Life is hard to believe, ask any scientist. God is hard to believe, ask any believer. What is your problem with hard to believe?"
11122,"The lower you are, the higher your mind will want to soar."
11123,"Truth is a nebulous thing. There are certain, definite truths, but the truth of our lives goes far beyond facts."
11124,"I was giving up. I would have given up - if a voice hadn't made itself heard in my heart. The voice said ""I will not die. I refuse it. I will make it through this nightmare. I will beat the odds, as great as they are. I have survived so far, miraculously. Now I will turn miracle into routine. The amazing will be seen everyday. I will put in all the hard work necessary. Yes, so long as God is with me, I will not die. Amen."
11125,Religion is more than rite and ritual.

11129,This life will never be without storms. Stop fearing the storm. Build your inner shelter.
11130,"We often wonder why God gives and takes, constricts and expands. What we forget is that human beings understand things by their opposites. Without dark, we can’t understand light. Without hardship, we wouldn’t *experience* ease. Without the existence of deprivation and loss, we couldn’t grasp the need for gratitude or the virtue of patience. And without separation, we wouldn’t taste the sweetness of reunion. Glory be to the one who gives—even when He takes."
11131,"You can search the world over, but you won’t find happiness until you realize that happiness 
 isn’t getting what you want. It’s being content with what you already have."

Life is in seeking and in finding. Life is in redemption. Each moment is a new birth. A new chance to come back, to get it right. 
 A new chance to make it better."
11133,"Holding on to hope when everything is dark, is the greatest test of faith"
11134,"How could you feel worthless when God has honoured you by creating you and choosing you to be with Him, in this life and the next? You are worthy. You are worthy of love. You are worthy of respect. You haven't failed. You're beautiful. Only the beautiful can see beauty. Never doubt your beauty. Never doubt your worth. It's not about how much you make, your grades, what people say or think. It's about you and God. It's about your heart. The blinding beauty of your heart."
11135,Everything you have is on loan. Foolish is the one who gets attached to a loan.
11136,The body has many needs. But the soul has only one: to be with God.
11137,"People think that tests only come in the form of hardships. Allah also tests us with ease, it's often in the test of ease that we fail most."
11138,"Stop hating on yourself for not being perfect. If God wanted perfection, He would have made you an angel."
11139,"Try not to confuse attachment with love. Attachment is about fear and dependency, and has more to do with love of self than love of another. Love without attachment is the purest love because it isn't about what others can give you because your empty. It is about what you can give others because you're already full."
11140,"If you want this life to stop breaking your heart, stop giving your heart to this life."
11141,"Just as storms change the landscape of the earth, our hardships change the landscape of the heart."
11142,We are always looking for signs. We are always asking for God to 'speak' to us. But those signs are all around us. They are in everything. God is always 'speaking'. The question is whether we are listening.
11143,"Don't ever be afraid of giving. Give. Give of your time, your forgiveness, your understanding, your love. Give of your money. Give to the creation, and you'll be given by the Creator. Be generous, and the Most Generous will be generous with you."

11145,Beware of what you let enter your heart. There will come a day when you'd give anything to remove it.
11146,"There’s something amazing about this life. The very same worldly attribute that causes us pain is also what gives us relief: Nothing here lasts. What does that mean? It means that the breathtakingly beautiful rose in my vase will wither tomorrow. It means that my youth will neglect me. But it also means that the sadness I feel today will change tomorrow. My pain will die. My laughter won’t last forever but neither will my tears. We say this life isn’t perfect. And it isn’t. It isn’t perfectly good. But, it also isn’t perfectly bad, either."
11147,"Tawbah is the cleaning of the heart, dhikr is the feeding of the heart."
11148,"To all those broken or hopeless, I have learned this: Be grateful for every single person who was part of your story. The ones that hurt you. The ones that helped you. The ones that came, and the ones that left. They all taught you. Don't think for a moment that any of it was random. There are no oversights with God. Only perfectly crafted chapters in each unique journey."
11149,"Blessings come in packages of two. With every blessing is a test. So don't ever envy people who seem to have more than you. The more blessings, the more tests. And the greater the blessing, the harder the test."
11150,There's a special place in my heart for the ones who were with me at my lowest and still loved me when I wasn't very loveable.
11151,Sometimes the gifts of God aren't wrapped as we expect.

11154,"Put your soul in the palm of my hand for me to look at, like a crystal jewel. I'll sketch it in words."
11155,Our language is primarily for expressing human goodness and beauty.
11156,"Seeing the moon, he becomes the moon, the moon seen by him becomes him. He sinks into nature, becomes one with nature. The light of the ""clear heart"" of the priest, seated in the meditation hall in the darkness before the dawn, becomes for the dawn moon its own light."
11157,"The labor into which a heart has poured its whole love--where will it have its say, to excite and inspire, and when?"
11158,The road was frozen. The village lay quiet under the cold sky. Komako hitched up the skirt of her kimono and tucked it into her obi. The moon shone like a blade frozen in blue ice.
11159,"Because you cannot see him, God is everywhere."
11160,I suppose even a woman's hatred is a kind of love.
11161,"A secret, if it's kept, can be sweet and comforting, but once it leaks out it can turn on you with a vengeance."

11163,People have separated from each other with walls of concrete that blocked the roads to connection and love. and Nature has been defeated in the name of development.
11164,"In the depths of the mirror the evening landscape moved by, the mirror and the reflected figures like motion pictures superimposed one on the other. The figures and the background were unrelated, and yet the figures, transparent and intangible, and the background, dim in the gathering darkness, melted into a sort of symbolic world not of this world. Particularly when a light out in the mountains shone in the center of the girl's face, Shimamura felt his chest rise at the inexpressible beauty of it."
11165,"It's remarkable how we go on year after year, doing the same old things. We get tired and bored, and ask when they'll come for us"
11166,"Now, even more than the evening before, he could think of no one with whom to compare her. She had become absolute, beyond comparison. She had become decision and fate."
11167,"The woman was silent, her eyes on the floor. Shimamura had come to a point where he knew he was only parading his masculine shamelessness, and yet it seemed likely enough that the woman was familiar with the failing and need not be shocked by it. He looked at her. Perhaps it was the rich lashes of the downcast eyes that made her face seem warm and sensuous. She shook her head very slightly, and again a faint blush spread over her face."
11168,"Does pain go away and leave no trace, then?’ ‘You sometimes even feel sentimental for it."
11169,"And I can't complain. After all, only women are able really to love."
11170,"The snow on the distant mountains was soft and creamy, as if veiled in a faint smoke."
11171,"A child walked by, rolling a metal hoop that made a sound of autumn."
11172,From the way of Go the beauty of Japan and the Orient had fled. Everything had become science and regulation.
11173,I wonder what the retirement age is in the novel business. The day you die.
11174,"They were words that came out of nothing, but they seemed to him somehow significant. He muttered them over again."
11175,"Maybe vagueness has been good for me. The word means two different things in Tokyo and Osaka, you know. In Tokyo it means stupidity, but in Osaka they talk about vagueness in a painting and in a game of Go."
11176,"The sound of the freezing of snow over the land seemed to roar deep into the earth. There was no moon. The stars, almost too many of them to be true, came forward so brightly that it was as if they were falling with the swiftness of the void. As the stars came nearer, the sky retreated deeper and deeper into the night color. The layers of the Border Range, indistinguishable one from another, cast their heaviness at the skirt of the starry sky in a blackness grave and somber enough to communicate their mass. The whole of the night scene came together in a clear, tranquil harmony."
11177,
11178,"Hurt people hurt people. That's how pain patterns gets passed on, generation after generation after generation. Break the chain today. Meet anger with sympathy, contempt with compassion, cruelty with kindness. Greet grimaces with smiles. Forgive and forget about finding fault. Love is the weapon of the future."

11181,"You invite judgment into your life every time you judge others. To avoid this invitation to negativity, it's best to stop focusing on others' darkness.

11182,"Love is a weapon of Light, and it has the power to eradicate all forms of darkness. That is the key. When we offer love even to our enemies, we destroy their darkness and hatred."

11184,"Positive change always encounters resistance, conflict, and obstacles. We must embrace difficult and heated situations in life, for that is the method of igniting our reactions in order to transform them."
11185,"On one hand, we know that everything happens for a reason, and there are no mistakes or coincidences. On the other hand, we learn that we can never give up, knowing that with the right tools and energy, we can reverse any decree or karma. So, which is it? Let the Light decide, or never give up? The answer is: both."

Here’s wishing you the courage to keep growing so that you may know – or continue to know – the blessing of oneness."
11188,"Be the kind of person you want to be with... If you don't like the people in your life, you are the one who has to change, not them."
11189,"At the end of the day, the key to happiness is taking ultimate responsibility for your reactions to all of your experiences - the good and the chaotic."
11190,God never answers prayers. It is people who answer their own prayers by knowing how to connect and utilize the divine energy of the Creator and the God-like force in their own souls.

11194,If we are going to be happy and have any chance at growing then we must learn how to forgive others ... and ourselves.
11195,"Our good nature and endearing qualities will not arouse the answers to our prayers. Rather it is our mischievous, dishonest attributes that provide the master keys to heaven. When we identify and work to transform our self-centered qualities and crooked characteristics, the key turns and the gates unlock. Blessings and good fortune are now free to rain down upon us."
11196,"Your garbage, transformed, is your gift."
11197,"If we each take responsibility in shifting our own behavior, we can trigger the type of change that is necessary to achieve sustainability for our race or this planet. We change our planet, our environment, our humanity every day, every year, every decade, and every millennia."
11198,"The more we invest in our spirituality, the more consistently we can elevate our consciousness and connect to the spiritual source of everything good."
11199,"Always run after opportunities to create peace between people, to find ways to bridge differences, please. Because as long as one person continues to feel separation… …we'll all still feel it. Close the space between you and someone today. Seeing their essential goodness helps a lot."
11200,"Loving one another isn’t enough to make a relationship last. The real glue that holds a couple (or friends or family) together is the effort both put into helping others who are in need of financial, health, personal or emotional assistance.

I like it when the hay, unkempt, uncombed, with dry berries mixed in it, thrown together gaily and freely, bounces along atop some truck-and more, if there are some lovely and healthy lasses atop the hay-and better yet if the branches catch at the hay, and some of it tumbles to the road."

11227,
11228,"It is an error to divide people into the living and the dead: there are people who are dead-alive, and people who are alive-alive. The dead-alive also write, walk, speak, act. But they make no mistakes; only machines make no mistakes, and they produce only dead things. The alive-alive are constantly in error, in search, in questions, in torment."

11237,"Children are the boldest philosophers. They enter life naked, not covered by the smallest fig leaf of dogma, absolutes, creeds. This is why every question they ask is so absurdly naïve and so frighteningly complex."
11238,You're in bad shape. It looks like you're developing a soul.
11239,"Knowledge, absolutely sure of its infallibility, is faith."
11240,A man is like a novel: until the very last page you don't know how it will end. Otherwise it wouldn't be worth reading.
11241,"I am aware of myself. And, of course, the only things that are aware of themselves and conscious of their individuality are irritated eyes, cut fingers, sore teeth. A healthy eye, finger, tooth might as well not even be there. Isn't it clear that individual consciousness is just sickness?"
11242,"All truths are erroneous. This is the very essence of the dialectical process: today's truths become errors tomorrow; there is no final number. This truth (the only one) is for the strong alone. Weak-nerved minds insist on a finite universe, a last number; they need, in Nietzsche's words, ""the crutches of certainty"". The weak-nerved lack the strength to include themselves in the dialectic syllogism."
11243,There is an excellent way to make predictions without the slightest risk of error: predict the past.
11244,"We need writers who fear nothing. (""Our Goal"")"

11246,"Crossing out is an art that is, perhaps, even more difficult than writing. It requires the sharpest eye to decide what is superfluous and must be removed.

11247,"You're in a bad way! Apparently, you have developed a soul."
11248,"The whole world is one immense woman, and we are in her very womb, we are not yet born, we are joyfully ripening."

11253,"Music enhances the education of our children by helping them to make connections and broadening the depth with which they think and feel. If we are to hope for a society of culturally literate people, music must be a vital part of our children's education."

What I've tried to do in the process of playing these four strings is to try and understand the people I meet, the stories they have to tell. And then become an advocate for them and their stories through music."
11265,"Bach takes you to a very quiet place within yourself, to the inner core, a place where you are calm and at peace."
11266,When we have a good balance between thinking and feeling... our actions and lives are always the richer for it.
11267,"You must have a reason to be in the places to which you go, and you must do only things that you really care about."
11268,"Classical music is one of the best things that ever happened to mankind. If you get introduced to it in the right way, it becomes your friend for life."
11269,"In performance, we have a greater purpose. The greater purpose is that we're communing together, and we want this moment to be really special for all of us. Because otherwise, why bother to have come at all? It's not about proving anything. It's about sharing something."
11270,"A Senegalese poet said 'In the end we will conserve only what we love. We love only what we understand, and we will understand only what we are taught.' We must learn about other cultures in order to understand, in order to love, and in order to preserve our common world heritage."
11271,"But an innovation, to grow organically from within, has to be based on an intact tradition, so our idea is to bring together musicians who represent all these traditions, in workshops, festivals, and concerts, to see how we can connect with each other in music."
11272,Perfection is not very communicative
11273,"I have yet to find something that beats the power of being in love, or the power of music at its most magical."
11274,Our cultural strength has always been derived from our diversity of understanding and experience.
11275,I remember when I was growing up. My great wish was to understand who I was and how I fit in the world.
11276,"When you learn something from people, or from a culture, you accept it as a gift, and it is your lifelong commitment to preserve it and build on it."
11277,
11278,"No Buddhist, no Christian, no Hindu. Deeply religious people have no religion. They belong to no seat, theirs is the religion of the heart!"
11279,"Happiness and sorrow are twins, let them come and go like clouds."
11280,Ill health is also a blessing. The flesh and the ego are weakened and contemplation of God becomes easier.
11281,Why do you want to open the outside door when there is an inside door?
11282,
11283,"It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future."
11284,
11285,"Listen up, because I've got nothing to say and I'm only gonna to say it once."
11286,Ninety percent of all mental errors are in your head.
11287,Make a game plan and stick to it. Unless it's not working.
11288,"When the waitress asked if I wanted my pizza cut into four or eight slices, I said, 'Four. I don't think I can eat eight.'"
11289,You can observe a lot by just watching.
11290,In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is.
11291,The future ain't what it used to be.
11292,"If you're feeling good, don't worry. You'll get over it."
11293,
11294,"You should always go to other people's funerals, otherwise, they won't come to yours."
11295,"Life is a learning experience, only if you learn."
11296,"We're lost, but we're making good time."
11297,I'd give my right arm to be ambidextrous.
11298,
11299,Laughter is the shock absorber that eases the blows of life.
11300,"If I had to do it all over again, I would do it all over again."
11301,"If you don't know where you're going, when you get there you'll be lost."
11302,I don't want to make the wrong mistake.
11303,"Nothing is like it seems, but everything is exactly like it is."
11304,"I knew I was going to take the wrong train, so I left early."
11305,"It's like deja-vu, all over again."
11306,"You can get old pretty young if you don't 
 take care of yourself."
11307,
11308,Black is modest and arrogant at the same time. Black is lazy and easy - but mysterious. [...] But above all black says this: 'I don't bother you - don't bother me'
11309,A beautiful flower does not exist. There's only a moment when a flower looks beautiful.
11310,"With my eyes turned to the past, I walk backwards into the future."
11311,Start copying what you love. Copy copy copy copy. At the end of the copy you will find your self.
11312,"Fashion cannot make you sexy. Experience makes you sexy. Imagination makes people sexy. You have to train yourself, you have to study, and you have to live your life."
11313,"Clothing doesn’t lie, it shows everything."
11314,"Colour disturbs people. I am confident in black, not in light. This dark side of life is attractive to me forever and from the beginning. I am a lazy designer when it comes to colour."
11315,"It meant something to me – the idea of a coat guarding and hiding a woman’s body. For me, a woman who is absorbed in her work, who does not care about gaining one’s favor, strong yet subtle at the same time, is essentially more seductive. The more she hides and abandons her femininity, the more it emerges from the very heart of her existence."
11316,"Dirty, stained, withered, broken things seem beautiful to me."
11317,"I hate fashion. Or the word fashion, which sounds colorful, extravagant, expensive and gorgeous. “I never wanted to walk the main street of fashion. I have been walking the sidewalks of fashion from the beginning, so I’m a bit dark."
11318,My role in all of this is very simple. I make clothing like armor. My clothing protects you from unwelcome eyes.
11319,"The more we possess, the more distant we grow from God."
11320,"Fashion is only complete when it is worn by ordinary people who exist now, managing their lives, loving and grieving."
11321,You can say that designing is quite easy; the difficulty lies in finding a new way to explore beauty
11322,"Men's clothing is more pure in design. It's more simple and has no decoration. Women want that. When I started designing, I wanted to make men's clothes for women. But there were no buyers for it. Now there are. I always wonder who decided that there should be a difference in the clothes of men and women. Perhaps men decided this."
11323,A pair of brilliantly cut cotton trousers can be more beautiful than a gorgeous silk gown.
11324,"I want to achieve anti-fashion through fashion. That's why I'm always heading in my own direction, in parallel to fashion."
11325,"I always want to have a new challenge involved. I need to put myself to the test, and if I make mistakes, it doesn't matter. What matters to me, instead, is making my dreams come true and putting them on display."
11326,Just listen to the material. What is it going to say? Just wait. Probably the material will tell you something.
11327,"If you feel strongly about someone, go up to them. Pursue what you want in life. Why be shy about something like that?"
11328,Beautiful things are disappearing every day.
11329,"I believe that there are three conditions to a woman’s beauty. First, you must realize that not all women are beautiful all of the time. Sometimes beauty comes on a subconscious level. When she is in love, or has met someone new and exciting, she shines. Second, you must understand that life is unfair. Beauty is something that, for some, must be worked at. The third condition is luck. Some women can just be lucky."
11330,Black is modest and arrogant at the same time.
11331,I don’t think we should try to make space our own. I believe that as modern people we should live in mobility. We should always be moving.
11332,
11333,A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality.
11334,Some people are old at 18 and some are young at 90. Time is a concept that humans created.
11335,
11336,Smile to the future and it will smile back to you
11337,Art is a way of survival.
11338,It's better to dance than to march through life.
11339,
11340,What is beauty? It's what you love.
11341,"When you are feeling bad, do one thing a day to make your heart dance. It could be a simple thing like looking up at the sky."
11342,"When you burn the chair, you suddenly realize that the chair in your mind did not burn or disappear"
11343,"You may think I’m small, but I have a universe inside my mind."
11344,"I really feel that artists or musicians are controversial people. Controversy is part of the nature of art and creativity. If people are not doing that, they're not artists - they're artisans."
11345,
11346,"Try to say nothing negative about anybody for three days, for forty-five days, for three months. See what happens to your life."
11347,"It's difficult to explain love. You want to explain water? You need a book for it. There are many different ways to explain what water is. Love is big, it's very big. I know that I have tons of it. But maybe we don't want to open up so much, and we think, maybe we don't have so much, but yes, you know that you have tons of love. We all do. Through that love we can connect, we can heal each other, we can make people, all of us, happy, joyful, and make a better world."
11348,"Each time we don't say what we wanna say, we're dying."
11349,Every moment in our lives is a miracle we should enjoy instead of ignoring.
11350,"All my life, I have been in love with the sky. Even when everything was falling apart around me, the sky was always there for me."
11351,World peace is one project that we have to do together.
11352,"Be silent in a group of people 
 See what they reveal to you."
11353,The regret of my life is that I have not said 'I love you' often enough.
11354,Tape the sound of friends laughing together. Save it for a rainy day.
11355,"Most people think that I am too optimistic, but my optimism is based on the thought that negative thinking is a luxury that we can't afford."
11356,"Everybody's an artist. Everybody's God. It's just that they're inhibited. I believe in people so much that if the whole of civilization is burned so we don't have any memory of it, even then people will start to build their own art. It is a necessity -- a function. We don't need history."
11357,"In parting, I would like to give you one small piece of advice to keep in your heart. You may have heard me say this before, but it is the key point of the entire path, so it bears repeating: All that we are looking for in life — all the happiness, contentment, and peace of mind — is right here in the present moment. Our very own awareness is itself fundamentally pure and good. The only problem is that we get so caught up in the ups and downs of life that we don’t take the time to pause and notice what we already have."
11358,"Ultimately, happiness comes down to choosing between the discomfort of becoming aware of your mental afflictions and the discomfort of being ruled by them."
11359,"If you're determined to think of yourself as limited, fearful, vulnerable, or scarred by past experience, know only that you have chosen to do so. The opportunity to experience yourself differently is always available."
11360,"All that we are looking for in life - all the happiness, contentment, and peace of mind - is right here in the present moment."
11361,"If we could see the whole truth of any situation, our only response would be one of compassion."
11362,"Simply notice that you're aware. At any given moment, you can choose to follow the chain of thoughts, emotions, and sensations that reinforce a perception of yourself as vulnerable and limited, or to remember that your true nature is pure, unconditioned, and incapable of being harmed."
11363,"Meditation is really quite simple. All we have to do is embrace each experience with awareness and open our hearts fully to the present moment. When we are completely at ease with our own being, the ripples of awareness naturally spread out in all directions, touching the lives of everyone we meet."
11364,"If you don’t try to stop whatever is going on in your mind, but merely observe it, eventually you’ll begin to feel a tremendous sense of relaxation, a vast sense of openness within your mind - which is in fact your natural mind, the naturally unperturbed background against which various thoughts come and go."
11365,"Happiness and unhappiness are not primarily created by the material world or the physical body. First and foremost, they are decisions of the mind."
11366,"When you transform your mind, everything you experience is transformed."
11367,"Meditation is actually a very simple exercise in resting in the natural state of your present mind, and allowing yourself to be simply and clearly present to whatever thoughts, sensations, or emotions occur."
11368,"The mind is the source of all experience, and by changing the direction of the mind, we can change the quality of everything we experience."
11369,When we become fixed in our perceptions we lose our ability to fly.
11370,"So overall, though my life is far from perfect, I'm contented with it. And in a peculiar way, I'm grateful for the troubling emotions I experienced. The obstacles we face in life can provide powerful incentives for change."
11371,"Compassion is the spontaneous wisdom of the heart. It's always with us. It always has been, and always will be. When it arises in us, we've simply learned to see how strong and safe we really are."
11372,There's no difference between what is seen and the mind that sees it.
11373,"You don't want to block your thoughts, emotions, and so on; nor do you want to chase after them. If you chase after them, if you let them lead you, they begin to define you, and you lose your ability to respond openly and spontaneously in the present moment. On the other hand, if you attempt to block your thoughts, your mind can become quite tight and small."
11374,The opportunity to experience yourself differently is always available.
11375,Within our perceived weaknesses and imperfections lies the key to realizing our true strength.
11376,"Any attempt to capture the direct experience of the nature of mind in words is impossible. The best that can be said is that it is immeasurably peaceful and, once stabilized through repeated experience, virtually unshakable. It's an experience of absolute well-being that radiates through all physical, emotional and mental states-even those that might ordinarily be labeled as unpleasant."
11377,"Being human means having power; specifically, the power to accomplish whatever we want."
11378,Compassion is the spontaneous wisdom of the heart.
11379,"It’s so easy to think that we’re the only ones who suffer, while other people are somehow immune to pain, as though they’d been born with some kind of special knowledge about being happy, that, through some cosmic accident, we never received. Thinking in this way, we make our own problems seem much bigger than they really are."
11380,We're all buddhas. We just don't recognize it.
11381,Not recognizing natural mind is simply an example of the mind's unlimited capacity to create whatever it wants.
11382,
11383,
11384,
11385,"Let's say your past is your present and your present is your cash, So I look forward to the future."
11386,My hustle is nonstop. I never stop hustling.
11387,"I used to hit the kitchen lights, cockroaches everywhere.
Hit the kitchen lights, now it's marble floors everywhere."
11388,"Real recognize real, I suppose."
11389,I think I got a lot of life skills; I got a lot of wisdom; I've seen a lot of bad things happen to a lot of good people.
11390,"Anybody that's got a problem with me is probably envious or wants to be me, and that's how I've always looked at it."
11391,"Everyday, all day I have to be productive. And when I ain't productive, I get concerned."
11392,"Sometimes when people get success they forget about the people that pointed them there or championed them into this position. I pride myself on really understanding. I wouldn't even call it keeping it real. I just call it keeping it me. When they tell me, ""You're doing what you're supposed to do,"" it makes me go ten times even harder, because I know that there are people on the sidelines and they're watching me. They're cheering for me. I want to be the best me I could possibly be when it comes to them."
11393,"I just think a hustler's ambition is that I never stop. I start off hustling and said I'll never stop hustling. An ambitious hustler is the one to hustle the hustlers. When I grew up, my heroes were hustlers. Now I'm their hero."
11394,"Love don't love nobody got me feeling like, I shouldn't love myself"
11395,"You gotta have life your way. If you ain't losing your mind, you ain't partying right."
11396,Anything that looks good makes you feel better.
11397,"You've got to be happy with yourself. You can't sell yourself if you're out here and you ain't good. Because you're giving people messages, and if your message is wrong, then it's like the blind leading the blind."
11398,"Anybody that I ever dealt with knows that I'm a very focused individual, and when it comes to my work and what I do, you might have to play the back burner to that."
11399,I never wanted to be a statistic. I never wanted to be that cat who tried and never made it.
11400,"Sexy, no alcoholic, but she drink like a toilet. Told her do me a favor and put your mouth on this faucet."
11401,"I love the streets, and the streets love me back. And when things ain't going the way they should go, they let you know... and when they happy, you gotta keep 'em happy."
11402,"A lot of things come with fame, whether it's losing friends or losing family. You still gotta stand up and be that guy even when you ain't having great things. Because you've gotta be the spokesperson for your people."
11403,"When money was plentiful, I was the first one who told you to stack it. Live your life with it. Now that money slowed up, I'ma be the one telling you to save it like they ain't gon' make it no more."
11404,"If I'm gonna put a message out there, I want to make sure I stay consistent. I'm up on my game, because I said it. People take your words and they live by them."
11405,I could sit right here and have a 15-minute conversation with somebody and change their whole life.
11406,I ain't a rapper; I'm a motivational speaker. I don't do shows; I do seminars. I really talk to people.
11407,
11408,Perfect purity is possible if you turn your life into a line of poetry written with a splash of blood.
11409,Beauty is something that burns the hand when you touch it.
11410,"The highest point at which human life and art meet is in the ordinary. To look down on the ordinary is to despise what you can't have. Show me a man who fears being ordinary, and I'll show you a man who is not yet a man."
11411,"Young people get the foolish idea that what is new for them must be new for everybody else too. No matter how unconventional they get, they're just repeating what others before them have done."
11412,"As long as you know I am waiting, take your time flowers of the spring."
11413,"Dreams, memories, the sacred--they are all alike in that they are beyond our grasp. Once we are even marginally separated from what we can touch, the object is sanctified; it acquires the beauty of the unattainable, the quality of the miraculous. Everything, really, has this quality of sacredness, but we can desecrate it at a touch. How strange man is! His touch defiles and yet he contains the source of miracles."
11414,Living is merely the chaos of existence.
11415,We live in an age in which there is no heroic death.
11416,Nobody even imagines how well one can lie about the state of one’s own heart.
11417,"What transforms this world is - knowledge. Do you see what I mean? Nothing else can change anything in this world. Knowledge alone is capable of transforming the world, while at the same time leaving it exactly as it is. When you look at the world with knowledge, you realize that things are unchangeable and at the same time are constantly being transformed."
11418,"When silence is prolonged over a certain period of time, it takes on new meaning."
11419,"For an artist to do creative work, he needs at once physical health and some physiomental ill health. He needs both serenity and gloom."
11420,The special quality of hell is to see everything clearly down to the last detail.
11421,Human life is limited but I would like to live forever.
11422,"a samurai is a total human being, whereas a man who is completely absorbed in his technical skill has degenerated into a ‘function’, one cog in a machine."
11423,For clearly it is impossible to touch eternity with one hand and life with the other.
11424,I had no taste for defeat - much less victory - without a fight.
11425,Anything can become excusable when seen from the standpoint of the result
11426,"Yet how strange a thing is the beauty of music! The brief beauty that the player brings into being transforms a given period of time into pure continuance; it is certain never to be repeated; like the existence of dayflies and other such short-lived creatures, beauty is a perfect abstraction and creation of life itself. Nothing is so similar to life as music."
11427,"Better to be caught in sudden, complete catastrophe than to be gnawed by the cancer of imagination."
11428,"Quite possibly, what I call happiness may coincide with what others call the moment of imminent danger"
11429,"To see human beings in agony, to see them covered in blood and to hear their death groans, makes people humble. It makes their spirits delicate, bright, peaceful. It's never at such times that we become cruel or bloodthirsty. No, it's on a beautiful spring afternoon like this that people suddenly become cruel. It's at a moment like this, don't you think, while one's vaguely watching the sun as it peeps through the leaves of the trees above a well-mown lawn? Every possible nightmare in the world, every possible nightmare in history, has come into being like this."
11430,The most appropriate type of daily life for me was a day-by-day world destruction; peace was the most difficult and abnormal state to live in.
11431,Possessing by letting go of things was a secret of ownership unknown to youth.
11432,
11433,"Remember that consciousness is power. Consciousness is education and knowledge. Consciousness is becoming aware. It is the perfect vehicle for students. Consciousness-raising is pertinent for power, and be sure that power will not be abusively used, but used for building trust and goodwill domestically and internationally. Tomorrow's world is yours to build."
11434,"So, transform yourself first… Because you are young and have dreams and want to do something meaningful, that in itself, makes you our future and our hope. Keep expanding your horizon, decolonize your mind, and cross borders."
11435,"The United States of America is a nation where people are not united because of those three glaring frailties: racism, injustices and inequities."
11436,Remember that consciousness is power. Tomorrow's world is yours to build.
11437,Our ultimate objective in learning about anything is to try to create and develop a more just society.
11438,"First and foremost, you do not have to live up to or emulate the lives of any of your predecessors. But at the very least, you should know about them. You will have your own life, interests, and ideas of what you want or do not want in life. Do what you enjoy doing. Be honest with yourself and others. Don't think of satisfying anyone: your elders, peers, government, religion, or children who will come after you. Develop meaningful ideals, and become conscious of others, their existence, and their lives."
11439,Don't become too narrow. Live fully. Meet all kinds of people. You'll learn something from everyone. Follow what you feel in your heart.
11440,"The movement is contagious, and the people in it are the ones who pass on the spirit."
11441,"People have a right to violence, to rebel, to fight back. And given what the United States Government and Western powers have done to the third world, I feel that these countries should fight back."
11442,I don't think there will ever be a time when people will stop wanting to bring about change.
11443,We are all part of one another.
11444,The most important thing today is to stop US wars.
11445,
11446,"Without elegance of the heart, there is no elegance."
11447,"Fashion comes and goes, but style is eternal."
11448,When you feel good in a clothing anything can happen. A good clothing is a passport for happiness.
11449,The most beautiful makeup of a woman is passion. But cosmetics are easier to buy.
11450,I prefer to shock rather than to bore through repetition.
11451,"The most beautiful clothes that can dress a woman are the arms of the man she loves. But for those who haven't had the fortune of finding this happiness, I am there."
11452,Over the years I have learned that what is important in a dress is the woman who is wearing it.
11453,"I love black because it affirms, designs and styles. A woman in a black dress is a pencil stroke."
11454,"Fashions fade, style is eternal."
11455,"Chanel freed women, and I empowered them."
11456,What is wonderful about my art is that dream and reality can become one. There is just one step between the two.
11457,"To be beautiful, woman enough to have a black sweater, black skirt and walk arm in arm with the man she loves."
11458,"I have always believed that fashion was not only to make women more beautiful, but also to reassure them, give them confidence."
11459,"Dressing is a way of life. It brings you joy. It can give you freedom and liberation, help you to find yourself and to move without restraint. Isn't elegance forgetting what one is wearing?"
11460,Fashion is like a party. Getting dressed is preparing to play a role.
11461,"Le plus beau vêtement qui puisse habiller une femme, ce sont les bras de l'homme qu'elle aime. Mais, pour celles qui n'ont pas eu la chance de trouver ce bonheur, je suis là."
11462,A woman's wardrobe shouldn't change every six months. You should be able to use the pieces you already own and add to them. Because they are like timeless classics.
11463,Dressing is a way of life.
11464,We must never confuse elegance with snobbery.
11465,"Fashions pass quickly, and nothing is more pathetic than those puppets of fashion outrageously made up one day, pale the next, pleated or ironed stiff, libertine or ascetic. Playing with fashion is an art. The first rule is don't burn your wings."
11466,Isn't elegance forgetting what one is wearing?
11467,"Decadence attracts me. It suggests a new world, and, for me, society's struggle between life and death is absolutely beautiful."
11468,"I always believed that style was more important than fashion. They are rare, those who imposed their style while fashion makers are so numerous."
11469,"I am no longer concerned with sensation and innovation, but with the perfection of my style."
11470,
11471,The hardest thing in the world is to simplify your life; it’s so easy to make it complex.
11472,
11473,"Who are businesses really responsible to? Their customers? Shareholders? Employees? We would argue that it’s none of the above. Fundamentally, businesses are responsible to their resource base. Without a healthy environment there are no shareholders, no employees, no customers and no business."
11474,"The whole purpose of an adventure is to gain some spiritual or emotional insight. When you compromise the process, you compromise the gain."
11475,It's not an adventure until something goes wrong.
11476,"The secret to happiness is to be working at your passion. If you want to be miserable, lead a desperate life like everybody else where they drag their asses to work everyday because they hate their job."
11477,"To do good, you actually have to do something."
11478,"Real adventure is defined best as a journey from which you may not come back alive, and certainly not as the same person."
11479,"We're a part of nature. As we destroy nature, we destroy ourselves. It's a selfish thing to want to protect nature."
11480,"There's no difference between a pessimist who says, ""Oh it's hopeless, so don't bother doing anything."" and an optimist who says, ""Don't bother doing anything, it's going to turn out fine anyways. Either way, nothing happens."""

11710,The solution for mankind is of a spiritual nature. It is not a political or religious solution. It's the ability to love each other. That's the only solution I see.
11711,"Judaism, Christianity, Islam, all of these are branches, the root is love and that's where I went. I went straight to the root, I forgot the branches and I went straight to the root so that is how I see it, that is after I said of research and study and going through different phases of mental evolution, mental and consciousness evolution, not just believing in a book, believing in a certain idea, being willing to think for yourself and formulate your own ideas."
11712,"Love is cheering and sharing and compassion, and giving and receiving. Love is an action thing more than a word thing, that brings comfort or joy, or relief to anyone or anything."
11713,"God is like the sun. When the sun shines, it shines for everyone. God is for everyone."
11714,"I don't fight creativity. I don't fight against not being creative. If I'm not being creative, I'm not forcing it."
11715,"No matter the bad things that happened in past time, let's try to live the best we can now."
11716,"If religion had a good purpose, then man would have created something great. But we're man: we mess up everything. We mess up nature. We mess up God. We take what is given to us and make it into what we think it should be."
11717,"Children are the world's future, and we need to take care of them like we would any precious resource."
11718,The truth - you've got to deal with it or it will kill you bit by bit.
11719,Everything is connected. There is nothing that is not connected.
11720,My life is a life of accepting what the universe has offered me... I don't fight the universe.
11721,"It was my dad’s idea that music is supposed to be more than simply about entertainment and making a living, but about being of service as an integral part of the consciousness of the world. In honor of him and because it’s right, I use music in that light."
11722,"Each of us has some change within us, we cannot change the political or the social system of the world unless we change inside of us as individuals and that’s the direction I am in now which I call spiritual."
11723,"The last thing my father told me was: 'On your way up, take me up. On your way down, don't let me down.' A father telling his son that puts some responsibility on my shoulders. He told me that, and I take it very seriously."
11724,"There's a rainbow in the sky, all the time, don't be blind"
11725,"Reggae has a philosophy, you know? It's not just entertainment. There's an idea behind it, a way of life behind the music, which is a positive way of life, which is a progressive way of life for better people."
11726,What inspires me is the universe.
11727,There's more to life than physical and material.
11728,
11729,"I once cried because I had no shoes to play soccer, but one day, I met a man who had no feet."
11730,"Life is full of regrets, but it doesn't pay to look back."
11731,Sometimes words are harder than blows.
11732,Everything I have achieved in football is due to playing football in the streets with my friends
11733,"I reached this level by sheer dint of hard work, toiling away at scores of tricks and experiments. I used to play with the ball from dawn till dusk and just kept practising. If I wasn't playing matches, it was trying out one on one or two against two with a tennis ball. Then I used to try aiming at certain targets. That's the only way to learn. And if I missed the target, I kept trying until I scored"
11734,You can't get bored of winning. You can win 10 games in a row but you keep the same will to snatch the 11th. You always need more.
11735,"I have a need to play intensely every day, to fight every match hard."
11736,"It's true, pressure is something that goes with football nowadays. You need to accept it, and everything that it involves - the good and the bad."
11737,Nobody knows if Zidane is an angel or demon. He smiles like Saint Teresa and grimaces like a serial killer.
11738,I was lucky to come from a difficult area. It teaches you not just about football but also life. There were lots of kids from different races and poor families. People had to struggle to get through the day.
11739,"I may have had a lot of luck in my life, but I still need to find a challenge in the game."
11740,I am proud of where I come from and I will never forget the people I grew up with.
11741,Messi is the Mozart of football.
11742,"Real Madrid is the most important thing that happened to me, both as a footballer and as a person."
11743,"Ronaldinho is a special player, but Thierry Henry is probably technically the most gifted footballer ever to play the beautiful game."
11744,"It doesn't matter how many times you win an award, it is always very special."
11745,"Zidane was from another planet. When Zidane stepped onto the pitch, the 10 other guys just got suddenly better. It is that simple."
11746,"It's hard to explain but I have a need to play intensely every day, to fight every match hard. And this desire never to stop fighting is something else I learnt in the place where I grew up."
11747,I am supposed to set an example to young players.
11748,"You rarely come across the complete footballer, but Scholes is as close to it as you can get. One of my regrets is that the opportunity to play alongside him never presented itself during my career."
11749,"We must not let ourselves get driven off course, no matter what happens we must stick to our natural game."
11750,We are well aware of the task ahead of us in what will be a very difficult match but which we all dream of playing.
11751,"Every day I think about where I come from and I am still proud to be who I am: first, a Kabyle from La Castellane, then an Algerian from Marseille, and then a Frenchman."
11752,I don't know if we are the best team in the world. I am lucky to be playing alongside some of the best players around. It's a dream.
11753,
11754,There is no great; there is no small; in the mind that causeth all
11755,I fear no man. Sometimes I think I do not even fear God.
11756,"A wee child toddling in a wonder world, I prefer to their dogma my excursions into the natural gardens where the voice of the Great Spirit is heard in the twittering of birds, the rippling of mighty waters, and the sweet breathing of flowers. If this is Paganism, then at present, at least, I am a Pagan."
11757,
11758,The race belongs not only to the swift and strong but to those who keep on running
11759,Either you have your dreams or you live your dreams.
11760,Either you have dreams or you live your dreams.  I'm not all that remarkable.  I just keep putting one foot in front of the other until I get to where I have to go.
11761,"I believe people run marathons every day of their lives in one way or another, and we need to remember to give ourselves the finishers' medals we deserve."
11762,
11763,"Be confident, and just do it. It's all about not questioning what everyone else is thinking, since they're probably looking to others to know what is or isn't cool."
11764,"Im a total weirdo and have often felt like an outcast and a freak, and I love that. It makes things so much more exciting."
11765,"If you're not taking care of yourself, lipstick and foundation isn't really going to do anything for you."
11766,"Once women find sisterhood, there's nothing stronger."
11767,"That's the most important thing in art: to be aware, pay attention, be inspired - but it should come ultimately from you."
11768,"I'm happy to just sit in a cafe and watch people. It's my favorite thing to do, for sure."
11769,"The thing that my parents have always taught me is that beauty comes from the inside, and also that beauty stems from health."
11770,Artists also have the responsibility of reflecting the truth.
11771,"Fashion is fun, and fashion is a form of art and self-expression. And I think it should have a wink-wink nature to it. For me, it's about the way it makes you feel. If you want to feel sexy, you want to feel bright, you want to feel good. That's what people are attracted to - when they see you execute an emotion or an idea clearly and proudly."
11772,I see the human in everyone and everything. No one is more important than anyone else; I still hang out with my high school friends.
11773,"I think it [my first heartbreak] probably just taught me that you will always heal. That this too shall pass. The first time you feel that sort of pain, you think it's never going to go away. Once you do survive it, you realize you can survive anything."
11774,"Black women have kinky hair, and we think we have limitations on what we can do. It's interesting that people think, 'Oh this is the only thing they can do.' But if you have blonde, straight hair and don't change it for 20 years - nobody thinks about it. Nobody says anything!"
11775,"You have to take care of your body, you have to rest, drink water, try to eat well, and then on top of that, you use makeup to highlight your beauty that comes from your health."
11776,"Television's getting better because people are investing more money and time and respect into it. But the secret weapon of television is that, because it's a slow burn, you get to meditate on things and develop them. As opposed to film, where you have an allotted amount of time and hopefully you can wrap it up in there."
11777,When you're making an independent film and you care about it so much you do all the prep work beforehand.
11778,"That's my approach to makeup in general, highlight something, what you love about yourself, but don't cover anything up, or distract from what you actually look like."
11779,I think it's important to represent black women and our natural hair. Not wearing a weave is totally beautiful and acceptable.
11780,I think less is more in terms of makeup in general.
11781,"When you look cakey, or you have too much on, and you actually see the makeup, the makeup isn't doing its job. When you use the makeup in a way where the people aren't thinking about the makeup, and they're looking at you, that's what we want."
11782,"So, absolutely, [my Dad] will call and say, ""I just got offered this or that and what do you think?"" My Mom [Lisa Bonet] will do the same. And we all trust each other's opinions. And we all know each other so well and what we're capable of so, if someone's scared to do something, we encourage them to take that chance because we believe in each other as a family."
11783,"The kinds of things I like with crystals are the really beautiful costume jewelry, vintage pieces, and they usually have that diamond shape."
11784,"It kind of varies. I don’t have a method yet. It depends on the script and the character I think I need. I’ve worked with acting coaches, researched roles, and channeled different parts of myself. It’s on a case-by-case for me, right now."
11785,"I don’t know what the secret is. We’re a family… We all love each other… and we’ve all worked through whatever issues there’ve ever been, and in a healthy way. So, we all get along. Love conquers all, I guess."
11786,I'm pretty much a thrift shop gal. Flea markets on Sundays.
11787,
11788,"Look at me. I’m skinny, I have a big nose, no tits and no ass, but in a room full of beautiful women, I would still leave with the most gorgeous guy."
11789,"It's ok to say, 'this is what I want' and go after it."
11790,"Sometimes we have to be patient because the one thing that is inevitable in life is evolution. Whether it comes at the pace that we are expecting it or not, it’s inevitable."
11791,"People think of Latina women as being fiery and fierce, which is usually true. But I think the quality that so many Latinas possess is strength. I'm very proud to have Latin blood."
11792,A child speaks more sense than an adult half of the time.
11793,"I want to be the best daughter, sister, friend and wife I can possibly be - because when I die, I am not going to be buried with my Oscar."
11794,"I have been in relationships where a man has disrespected me, and I don't need to be friends with that man anymore. I don't want to be the one going, 'I'm cool, because I'm friends with all my exes.' There's a reason why you're called an ex. I crossed you off my list. Moving on. You cross a line, you need to know that you're going to walk this earth knowing that there's an individual who has no respect for you."
11795,"Not to settle. If you're not happy with a person, leave. And wait until you find that one person who makes you feel good about yourself every single day and is not expecting you to change, but to grow."
11796,You have to be very committed and find happiness in the work that you do.
11797,"I'm very accepting with my age. It's like notches on your belt: experience, wisdom, and a different kind of beauty. There comes a day when you've become comfortable in your skin."
11798,It takes a lot of courage to face up to things you can't do because we feed ourselves so much denial.
11799,Happiness is nothing but temporary moments here and there - and I love those. But I would be bored out of my mind if I were happy all the time.
11800,"I always strive to keep a balance with my fears. I don't like to be ruled by them. At the same time, I don't like the idea of living my life totally free of any fears. I like having that moderation."
11801,You need one hundred percent commitment; you have to be willing to wake up every morning knowing you're going to [practice] eight hours straight.
11802,"I like to be around people who are very passionate. People that won't fight but that will be very over-protective and outspoken about their opinion, their point of view, their ideas."
11803,There's nobody on this earth who can tell you that what you're feeling is wrong. They can tell you it's different to what they're feeling.
11804,"I want to have more sex, travel more, drink more wine and love life."
11805,"I have an amazing mother who's a real tough cookie. She taught me not to get emotional about [sexism in Hollywood], just be really practical and objective. Later, in the privacy of my own home, maybe I'll bawl or break some dishes, but you just have to keep going. It's not about fighting, it's about educating."
11806,"As a woman, you spend so much time either cooking or getting ready to go somewhere. I like to have music when I'm doing either of these things."
11807,"Britney's a very beautiful human being. After I worked with her, I realized that there was a reason why she was the most popular pop artist over so many other pop artists at that time who were more talented, had better voices. And it was because of her heart, her soulShe had the most amazing energy and was always positive and a very discreet person. We were young, too, and got to make a movie about three friends on a road trip. It was so much fun!"
11808,"There comes a day when you've become comfortable in your skin. But God as my witness, I am going to try to do everything I can to keep this ass together for as long as I possibly can - without going against nature."
11809,Let's start creating better roles that accurately depict people we know so closely.
11810,"Music is a very big participant in everything I do, from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed."
11811,Every character has their reasons - even the characters who do dumb things.
11812,
11813,"Nothing is more powerful than allowing yourself to truly be affected by things. Whether it’s a song, a stranger, a mountain, a tea kettle, an article, a sentence, a footstep -feel it all. Look around you. All of this is for you. Take it and have gratitude. Give it and feel love."
11814,Don't allow the coldness and fear of others to tarnish your perfectly vulnerable beating heart.
11815,Humor is a part of spirituality.
11816,"A lot of people work out to be skinny. That's so boring, and it seems like a depressing goal for a modern woman."
11817,I remember having this friend in school who said she didn't like the Beach Boys. And in that moment I knew we couldn't be friends anymore.
11818,It's never too late for a coffee. After all it's morning somewhere in the world.
11819,I am always early to work but sometimes late to other things.
11820,Everyone has the heartbreak that shapes them in a way that they could never go back to the innocence that they had before.
11821,"Writing music is really personal, and it's a really exciting thing to participate in because represents the full creative process: It feels like something is coming from nothing."
11822,"That is so personal, and it’s my pet peeve when people press you on it. And it’s always women who get asked! Is anybody saying that to George Clooney?"
11823,"Oh, me? I'm not 80% water. I'm 80% coffee, and a little bit of sass."
11824,I need a coffee to go with my coffee.
11825,You don't have to wear expensive clothes to look good.
11826,I’m just being myself. There is not an ounce of me that believes any of that crap that they say. We can’t be feminine and be feminists and be successful? I want to be a f-king feminist and wear a f-king Peter Pan collar. So f-king what?
11827,"What led me to be an actor is that I have a strange something in me that can drastically change the way I appear to the world. Growing up, I couldn't understand why people would always have different ideas of me - but because of that I became aware of how you can manipulate your own ability to change. And then I learned to make a career of it."
11828,I like having a schedule. I tend to be the type of person that thrives on something being regular.
11829,"Girls get competitive, as though there's only one spot in the world for everything _ but that's not true. We need to stick together and see there's more to life than pleasing men. It's important not to cut yourself off from female friendships. I think sometimes girls get scared of other girls, but you need each other."
11830,I just like music that sounds like music. Not like machines and computers and things that you design to make things sound slick and perfect.
11831,I think every year I become happier because I become more comfident and more comfortable in my own skin.
11832,"When I was 13, I wasn't the coolest kid in my class, and that inner dork is a wonderful thing to have."
11833,"I think my knowledge of music theory is rooted in jazz theory, and a lot of the writers of standards - Rodgers and Hart, and Gershwin."
11834,"The internet's like one big bathroom wall with a lot of people who anonymously can say really mean things. It's fine, I believe in freedom of speech and I think people should think what they want, but I don't care to hear it."
11835,"I like a lot of old films, I like a lot old music, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that I like the idea of knowing what happens before, so that I can understand it."
11836,"I'm not doing it to pander to people. I just always knew what I liked versus what I don't like. I never liked things with too many zippers or spikes and stuff. That weirds me out. I like things that are pretty. And I think it's great to be pretty. I like being feminine. I think it's good to be feminine. We don't need to look like men or dress like men or talk like men to be powerful. We can be powerful in our own way, our own feminine way."
11837,
11838,
11839,
11840,"I have the nerve to walk my own way, however hard, in my search for reality, rather than climb upon the rattling wagon of wishful illusions."
11841,Love makes your soul crawl out from its hiding place.
11842,
11843,"There's two things everybody got to find out for themselves: they got to find out about love, and they got to find out about living. Now, love is like the sea. It's a moving thing. And it's different on every shore. And living... well... There are years that ask questions and years that answer."
11844,"Such as I am, I am a precious gift."
11845,"If you haven't got it, you can't show it. If you have got it, you can't hide it."
11846,"I am not tragically colored. There is no great sorrow dammed up in my soul, nor lurking behind my eyes. I do not mind at all. I do not belong to the sobbing school of Negrohood who hold that nature somehow has given them a lowdown dirty deal and whose feelings are all hurt about it. Even in the helter-skelter skirmish that is my life, I have seen that the world is to the strong regardless of a little pigmentation more or less. No, I do not weep at the world—I am too busy sharpening my oyster knife."
11847,"Justice, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder."

11858,"Tell me, and then again show me, so I can know."
11859,"I do not pray. . . . I do not expect God to single me out and grant me advantages over my fellow men. . . . Prayer seems to me a cry of weakness, and an attempt to avoid, by trickery, the rules of the game as laid down. I do not choose to admit weakness. I accept the challenge of responsibility."
11860,Bitterness is the coward's revenge on the world for having been hurt.
11861,"If writers were too wise, perhaps no books would get written at all. It might be better to ask yourself 'Why?”'afterwards than before There is no agony like bearing an untold story inside you."
11862,
11863,"I always said marriage should be a fifty-fifty proposition. He should be at least fifty years old, and have at least fifty-million dollars."
11864,My husband said it was him or the cat. I miss him sometimes.
11865,I learned in school that money isn’t everything. It’s happiness that counts. So momma sent me to a different school.
11866,How many husbands have I had? You mean apart from my own?
11867,"Love should be an inspiration, not an obligation."
11868,Diamonds are a girl's best friend and dogs are a man's best friend. Now you know which sex has more sense.
11869,To have twenty lovers in one year is easy. To have one lover for twenty years is difficult.
11870,The only place men want depth in a woman is in her décolletage.
11871,Being jealous of a beautiful woman is not going to make you more beautiful.
11872,"A girl must marry for love, and keep on marrying until she finds it."
11873,I want a man who's kind and understanding. Is that too much to ask of a millionaire?
11874,I never hated a man enough to give him diamonds back.
11875,"What is really important for a woman, you know, even more than being beautiful or intelligent, is to be entertaining."
11876,I believe in large families: every woman should have at least three husbands.
11877,I call everyone 'Darling' because I can't remember their names.
11878,I love the intellectual type. They know everything and suspect nothing.
11879,"As a woman, you have to choose between your fanny or your face. I chose my face."
11880,There is nothing wrong with a woman welcoming all men's advances as long as they are in cash
11881,"I think breeds of dogs and breeds of men are quite a bit alike. If you think it’s insulting that I compare people with animals, well, if you knew how I love animals, you would understand that coming from me, this is a compliment."
11882,"I don't take gifts from perfect strangers — but then, nobody is perfect."
11883,A man in love is incomplete until he has married. Then he's finished.
11884,"Conrad Hilton was very generous in the divorce settlement. He gave me 5,000 Gideon Bibles."
11885,Getting divorced just because you don't love a man is almost as silly as getting married just because you do.
11886,"I know nothing about sex, because I was always married."
11887,
11888,"If things do not change, there will be nothing left to change. Either power must pass to the people or everything will perish."
11889,If the people wanted my head I would bow without demur. If I had lost the confidence or respect of the people I would not want to live. The tragedy of the drama is that the very opposite is true.
11890,I am guiding you to seek truth from the facts of the historical conditions of our society and to identify the problems. The correct solutions will come with the correct identification of the problems.
11891,"A dreaded society is not a civilized society. The most progressive and powerful society in the civilized sense, is a society which has recognized its ethos, and come to terms with the past and the present, with religion and science. With modernism and mysticism, with materialism and spirituality; a society free of tension, a society rich in culture. Such a society cannot come with hocus-pocus formulas and with fraud. It has to flow from the depth of a divine search."
11892,I'm not trying to minimize things; I'm trying to bring them back to reality.
11893,"Yes, there are circumstances where a bloody suppression is justifiable and justified."
11894,A regime which puts in a bunker the highest law in the land does not have the moral authority to say that nobody is above the law.

11898,Pakistan was once called the most allied ally of the United States. We are now the most non-allied.
11899,"Mrs. [Indira] Gandhi can rightly boast of having won a war, but if she won it, she should first of all thank Yahya Khan and his gang of illiterate psychopaths."
11900,I tried to explain that there was a great difference between me and Mujib [Rahiman]: he was a secessionist and I wasn't.
11901,There's only one man really responsible for those events - Yahya Khan. Both he and his advisers were so drunk with power and corruption they'd even forgotten the honor of the army.
11902,Tikka Khan won't try to stick his nose in politics.
11903,"In March [1972] the unity of Pakistan depended on the suppression of the secessionists. But to carry it out with such brutality on the people instead of on those responsible wasn't necessary. That's not the way to convince poor people who've been told that with the Six Points there'll be no more hurricanes, no more floods, no more hunger. I spoke out against such methods more emphatically than anyone else, and when no one dared do so."
11904,"In April [1972], after that fine business in Dacca, Yahya Khan sent for me. He looked satisfied, sure of himself, by now convinced he had the situation in hand. He offered me a drink. ""Well, you politicians are really finished,"" he said. Then he said that not only Mujib but I too was considered an agitator, I too was preaching against the unity of Pakistan. ""I'm always under pressure to arrest you, Bhutto"" I got so angry I lost all control."
11905,"The sanction of force stands behind the medley of personal orders and regulations of Martial Law. The sanction of the people's consent stands behind the hierarchy of laws. In one situation, the population is regimented into acquiescence. In the other, the population voluntarily establishes a contract with Parliament."
11906,"To conclude, the tragedy of March 25 [1969] caught me by surprise. Yahya Khan fooled even me."

12456,"You can't always come up with the optimal solution, but you can usually come up with a better solution."
12457,"Hope is not blind optimism. It's not ignoring the enormity of the task ahead or the roadblocks that stand in our path. It's not sitting on the sidelines or shirking from a fight. Hope is that thing inside us that insists, despite all evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us if we have the courage to reach for it, and to work for it, and to fight for it.

12471,"It's awfully important to win with humility. It's also important to lose. I hate to lose worse than anyone, but if you never lose you won't know how to act. If you lose with humility, then you can come back."
12472,"The old lessons (work, self-discipline, sacrifice, teamwork, fighting to achieve) aren't being taught by many people other than football coaches these days. The football coach has a captive audience and can teach these lessons because the communication lines between himself and his players are more wide open than between kids and parents.

12560,"Almost all education has a political motive: it aims at strengthening some group, national or religious or even social, in the competition with other groups.

Hardly anything is done to foster the inward growth of mind and spirit; in fact, those who have had the most education are very often atrophied in their mental and spiritual life."

 blow you to the place you are longing to be."

If we keep fighting within ourselves and losing our own inner battles, we’ll never have the strength to stand up and fight our true enemy."

12713,"There is another class of coloured people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs — partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs."

12718,"If you want to lift yourself up, lift up someone else."
12719,Of all forms of slavery there is none that is so harmful and degrading as that form of slavery which tempts one human being to hate another by reason of his race or color. One man cannot hold another man down in the ditch without remaining down in the ditch with him.

Yet, they kept coming back to Jesus."

I believe a joyful life is made up of joyful moments gracefully strung together by trust, gratitude and inspiration"
12766,"We can have courage or we can have comfort, but we cannot have both."
12767,Don't try to win over the haters; you are not a jackass whisperer.

12774,"Healthy striving is self-focused: ""How can I improve?"" Perfectionism is other-focused: ""What will they think?"""
12775,"People may call what happens at midlife 'a crisis,' but it's not.  It's an unraveling - a time when you feel a desperate pull to live the life you want to live, not the one you're 'supposed' to live.  The unraveling is a time when you are challenged by the universe to let go of who you think you are supposed to be and to embrace who you are."

12780,Nothing has transformed my life more than realizing that it's a waste of time to evaluate my worthiness by weighing the reaction of the people in the stands.
12781,"Our stories are not meant for everyone. Hearing them is a privilege, and we should always ask ourselves this before we share: ""Who has earned the right to hear my story?"" If we have one or two people in our lives who can sit with us and hold space for our shame stories, and love us for our strengths and struggles, we are incredibly lucky. If we have a friend, or small group of friends, or family who embraces our imperfections, vulnerabilities, and power, and fills us with a sense of belonging, we are incredibly lucky."
12782,"If we can share our story with someone who responds with empathy and understanding, shame can't survive."

12785,What makes you vulnerable makes you beautiful.

12803,"Your choice of people to associate with, both personally and business-wise, is one of the most important choices you make.  If you associate with turkeys, you will never fly with the eagles."

12805,Confidence on the outside begins by living with integrity on the inside.
12806,"Think about your future possibilities and the fact that your potential is virtually unlimited. You can do what you want to do and go where you want to go. You can be the person you want to be. You can set large and small goals and make plans and move step-by-step, progressively toward their realization. There are no obstacles to what you can accomplish except the obstacles that you create in your mind."
12807,The key to success is to focus our conscious mind on things we desire not things we fear.

12904,We do not mature through age. We mature in awareness.
12905,"Spare yourself from seeking love, approval, or appreciation-from anyone. And watch what happens in reality, just for fun."
12906,"Depression, pain, and fear are gifts that say, ""Sweetheart, take a look at your thinking in this moment. You're living in a story that isn't true for you."" Living a lie is always stressful. And investigating a lie through The Work always leads you back to who you are. Who you are is not an option. You are love. It hurts to believe you're other than who you are, to live any story less than love."
12907,My experience is that the teachers we need most are the people we're living with right now.
12908,Peace doesn't require two people; it requires only one. It has to be you. The problem begins and ends there.
12909,"If you want real control, drop the illusion of control; let life have you. It does anyway. You’re just telling yourself the story of how it doesn’t."
12910,"I can find only three kinds of business in the universe: mine, yours and God's. Much of our stress comes from mentally living out of our business. When I think, ""You need to get a job, I want you to be happy, you should be on time, you need to take better care of yourself,"" I am in your business. When I'm worried about earthquakes, floods, war, or when I will die, I am in God's business. If I am mentally in your business or in God's business, the effect is separation."
12911,"No one has ever been angry at
 another human being-we’re only angry at
 our story of them."
12912,
12913,"You can't go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending."
12914,"Life with God is not immunity from difficulties, but peace in difficulties."
12915,"Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience."
12916,"Once people stop believing in God, the problem is not that they will believe in nothing; rather, the problem is that they will believe anything."
12917,"The greatest evils in the world will not be carried out by men with guns, but by men in suits sitting behind desks"
12918,"Don't shine so that others can see you. Shine so that through you, others can see HIM."
12919,"Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less."
12920,Hardship often prepares an ordinary person for an extraordinary destiny.
12921,
12922,There is someone that I love even though I don't approve of what he does. There is someone I accept though some of his thoughts and actions revolt me. There is someone I forgive though he hurts the people I love the most. That person is......me.
12923,One of the most cowardly things ordinary people do is to shut their eyes to facts.
12924,"I'm not sure God wants us to be happy. I think he wants us to love, and be loved. But we are like children, thinking our toys will make us happy and the whole world is our nursery. Something must drive us out of that nursery and into the lives of others, and that something is suffering."
12925,"If you never take risks, you'll never accomplish great things. Everybody dies, but not everyone has lived."
12926,"Love is more than an emotion, it is a decision."
12927,We must stop regarding unpleasant or unexpected things as interruptions of real life. The truth is that interruptions are real life.
12928,"There are two kinds of people: those who say to God, 'Thy will be done,' and those to whom God says, 'All right, then, have it your way.'"
12929,Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward.
12930,I have often repented of speech but hardly ever of silence.
12931,On the back of Satan's neck is a nail scarred footprint.
12932,"You must make your choice: either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon; or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to."
12933,"Don't judge a man by where he is, because you don't know how far he has come."
12934,A sign of a culture that has lost its faith - Moral collapse follows upon spiritual collapse.
12935,Don't let your happiness depend on something you may lose.
12936,"There are two kinds of love: we love wise and kind and beautiful people because we need them, but we love (or try to love) stupid and disagreeable people because they need us. This second kind is the more divine because that is how God loves us: not because we are lovable but because He is love, not because He needs to receive but He delights to give."
12937,
12938,Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not: nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not: the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.
12939,
12940,"Restricted immigration is not an offensive but purely a defensive action. It is not adopted in criticism of others in the slightest degree, but solely for the purpose of protecting ourselves. We cast no aspersions on any race or creed, but we must remember that every object of our institutions of society and government will fail unless America be kept American."
12941,You can't increase prosperity by taxing success.
12942,"Wherever despotism abounds, the sources of public information are the first to be brought under its control."
12943,"You can't know too much, but you can say too much."
12944,"Liberty is not collective, it is personal. All liberty is individual liberty."
12945,"We do not need more material development, we need more spiritual development. We do not need more intellectual power, we need more moral power. We do not need more knowledge, we need more character. We do not need more government, we need more culture. We do not need more law, we need more religion. We do not need more of the things that are seen, we need more of the things that are unseen. It is on that side of life that it is desirable to put the emphasis at the present time. If that side be strengthened, the other side will take care of itself."
12946,Silence can never be misquoted.
12947,"In life there is nothing more common than talent and intelligence. What is missing is passion, persistence, commitment, and dedication."
12948,"The collection of taxes which are not absolutely required, which do not beyond reasonable doubt contribute to public welfare, is only a species of legalized larceny. Under this Republic the rewards of industry belong to those who earn them."
12949,"What we need is not more Federal government, but better local government."
12950,Your ability to face setbacks and disappointments without giving up will be the measure of your ability to succeed.
12951,"If all men are created equal, that is final. If they are endowed with inalienable rights, that is final. If governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, that is final. No advance, no progress can be made beyond these propositions."
12952,Doubters do not achieve; skeptics do not contribute; cynics do not create.
12953,Freedom is not only bought with a great price; it is maintained by unremitting effort.
12954,Nothing is easier than spending public money. It does not appear to belong to anybody. The temptation is overwhelming to bestow it on somebody.
12955,
12956,
12957,"The right thing to do never requires any subterfuge, it is always simple and direct."
12958,"I want the people of America to be able to work less for the government, and more for themselves"
12959,"In its main features the Declaration of Independence is a great spiritual document. It is a declaration not of material but of spiritual conceptions. Equality, liberty, popular sovereignty, the rights of man - these are not elements which we can see and touch. They are ideals. They have their source and their roots in the religious convictions. They belong to the unseen world. Unless the faith of the American people in these religious convictions is to endure, the principles of our Declaration will perish. We can not continue to enjoy the result if we neglect and abandon the cause."
12960,"We do not need more intellectual power, we need more spiritual power. We do not need more of the things that are seen, we need more of the things that are unseen."
12961,"There is no dignity quite so impressive, and no one independence quite so important, as living within your means."
12962,
12963,"Knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darkness's of other people. One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. The most terrifying thing is to accept oneself completely. Your visions will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes."
12964,"The world will ask you who you are, and if you don't know, the world will tell you."
12965,
12966,"We are not what happened to us, we are what we wish to become."
12967,
12968,"Life really does begin at forty. Up until then, you are just doing research."
12969,"Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes."
12970,VOCATUS ATQUE NON VOCATUS DEUS ADERIT.
12971,The difference between a good life and a bad life is how well you walk through the fire
12972,The foundation of all mental illness is the unwillingness to experience legitimate suffering.
12973,
12974,"Be grateful for your difficulties and challenges, for they hold blessings. In fact... Man needs difficulties; they are necessary for health personal growth, individuation and self-actualisation."
12975,Everyone you meet knows something you don't know but need to know.  Learn from them.
12976,"No tree, it is said, can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell."
12977,"A man likes to believe that he is the master of his soul. But as long as he is unable to control his moods and emotions, or to be conscious of the myriad secret ways in which unconscious factors insinuate themselves into his arrangements and decisions, he is certainly not his own master."
12978,We don't really heal anything; we simply let it go.
12979,The privilege of a lifetime is to become who you truly are.
12980,"We cannot change anything until we accept it. Condemnation does not liberate, it oppresses."
12981,The most dangerous things in the world are immense accumulations of human beings who are manipulated by only a few heads.
12982,Wisdom accepts that all things have two sides
12983,"Solitude is for me a fount of healing which makes my life worth living. Talking is often a torment for me, and I need many days of silence to recover from the futility of words."
12984,We meet ourselves time and again in a thousand disguises on the path of life.
12985,To ask the right question is already half the solution of a problem.
12986,"People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own souls. They will practice Indian yoga and all its exercises, observe a strict regimen of diet, learn the literature of the whole world - all because they cannot get on with themselves and have not the slightest faith that anything useful could ever come out of their own souls."
12987,"One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back."
12988,"Even through your hardest days, remember we are all made of stardust."
12989,Nothing disturbs me more than the glorification of stupidity.
12990,"Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known."
12991,Our passion for learning ... is our tool for survival.
12992,"If we can't think for ourselves, if we're unwilling to question authority, then we're just putty in the hands of those in power. But if the citizens are educated and form their own opinions, then those in power work for us. In every country, we should be teaching our children the scientific method and the reasons for a Bill of Rights. With it comes a certain decency, humility and community spirit. In the demon-haunted world that we inhabit by virtue of being human, this may be all that stands between us and the enveloping darkness."
12993,
12994,
12995,"I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time - [...] when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness."
12996,"You can't convince a believer of anything; for their belief is not based on evidence, it's based on a deep seated need to believe"
12997,
12998,We live on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam
12999,"If we are not able to ask skeptical questions, to interrogate those who tell us that something is true, to be skeptical of those in authority, then, we are up for grabs for the next charlatan (political or religious) who comes rambling along."
13000,The truth may be puzzling. It may take some work to grapple with. It may be counterintuitive. It may contradict deeply held prejudices. It may not be consonant with what we desperately want to be true. But our preferences do not determine what's true.
13001,"The words ""question"" and ""quest"" are cognates. Only through inquiry can we discover truth."
13002,"Cosmos is a Greek word for the order of the universe. It is, in a way, the opposite of Chaos. It implies the deep interconnectedness of all things. It conveys awe for the intricate and subtle way in which the universe is put together."
13003,You have to know the past to understand the present.
13004,"The dumbing down of America is evident in the slow decay of substantive content, a kind of celebration of ignorance."
13005,Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence
13006,"The universe is a pretty big place. If it's just us, seems like an awful waste of space."
13007,One of the great commandments of science is: 'Mistrust arguments from authority.'
13008,"Finding the occasional straw of truth awash in a great ocean of confusion and bamboozle requires intelligence, vigilance, dedication, and courage. But if we don't practice these tough habits of thought, we cannot hope to solve the truly serious problems that face us --- and we risk becoming a nation of suckers, up for grabs by the next charlatan who comes along."
13009,"It is the responsibility of scientists never to suppress knowledge, no matter how awkward that knowledge is, no matter how it may bother those in power; we are not smart enough to decide which pieces of knowledge are permissible, and which are not."
13010,Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it we go nowhere.
13011,The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence.
13012,
13013,Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me.
13014,"Before you go to bed, write down three 'gratefuls' for the day and three 'did wells' (they can even include something as simple as doing the laundry)-the results can be amazing!"
13015,It's almost impossible to be funnier than the people in Washington.
13016,"You have to have faith that there is a reason you go through certain things. I can't say I'm glad to go through pain, but in a way one must, in order to gain courage and really feel joy."
13017,"When you have a dream, you've got to grab it and never let go."
13018,No one ever said life was fair. Just Eventful.
13019,You have to go through the falling down in order to learn to walk. It helps to know that you can survive it. That's an education in itself.
13020,"Words, once they are printed, have a life of their own."
13021,Comedy is tragedy plus time.
13022,"If you want to know the feeling [of labor pain], just take your bottom lip and pull it over your head."
13023,"It's also selfish because it makes you feel good when you help others. I've been helped by acts of kindness from strangers. That's why we're here, after all, to help others."
13024,I think we're here for each other.
13025,We don't stop going to school when we graduate.
13026,Because nobody goes through life without a scar.
13027,I had a good loud voice and I wasn't afraid to be goofy or zany.
13028,"I was once asked to do my Tarzan yell at Bergdorf Goodman, and a guard burst in with a gun! Now I only do it under controlled circumstances."
13029,"If you see a kid in school, who is a little shy ... that's when you should reach out. When you do, you are going to open up a flower and discover something wonderful."
13030,"I have always grown from my problems and challenges, from the things that don't work out, that's when I've really learned."
13031,"You do have to love your kids enough to let them hate you. But it's the disease that's hating you, not them."
13032,I couldn't get the laughter out of my head. It wasn't career. It wasn't even a choice. It was a calling.
13033,"The first time someone said, 'What are your measurements?' I answered, '37, 24, 38 - but not necessarily in that order.'"
13034,I'm really not that funny in real life. But I am the best audience one could find. I love to laugh.
13035,Adolescence is just one big walking pimple.
13036,The audience is never wrong.
13037,
13038,"We are not meant to stay wounded. We are supposed to move through our tragedies and challenges and to help each other move through the many painful episodes of our lives. By remaining stuck in the power of our wounds, we block our own transformation. We overlook the greater gifts inherent in our wounds - the strength to overcome them and the lessons that we are meant to receive through them. Wounds are the means through which we enter the hearts of other people. They are meant to teach us to become compassionate and wise."
13039,"Just let go. Let go of how you thought your life should be, and embrace the life that is trying to work its way into your consciousness."
13040,"When you do not seek or need approval, you are at your most powerful."
13041,"Every single choice we make is either going to enhance the spirit or drain it. Every day, we're either giving ourselves power or taking it away."
13042,"Always go with the choice that scares you the most, because that's the one that is going to require the most from you.  Do you really want to look back on your life and see how wonderful it could have been had you not been afraid to live it?"
13043,"Forgiveness is a mystical act, not a reasonable one."
13044,"You have resources yet to be unleashed. Make bold, courageous choices. Live as though you have the power to change the world - because you do."
13045,"Self-love means caring for ourselves enough to forgive people in our past so that the wounds can no longer damage us - for our wounds do not hurt the people who hurt us, they hurt only us."
13046,Our lives change externally as we change internally.
13047,My prayer today is to become more mindful of my personal actions. What motivates me to do what I do and to say the things I do to others? I often dismiss my actions because of stress or anger but the people I hurt along the way do not dismiss what I've said or done. Every action and every word carries a consequence. Every person has stress and every person has anger. I would not like to be someone's target and I ask for the grace to become more mindful not to harm others just because I am having a bad day.
13048,"Get a backbone, not a wishbone."
13049,"The ability to know that your perceptions are accurate has to happen without others' validation. Intuition is not the result of diet, rituals, or wind chimes. It's the natural consequence of having self-esteem, the greatest power you can have. With self-esteem, your life can broaden into an adventure because you can know in your gut that you can handle the unknown. And you can handle helping others without fear, which is true liberation."
13050,Let me give up the need to know why things happen as they do. I will never know and constant wondering is constant suffering.
13051,"To love yourself, truly love yourself, is to finally discover the essence of personal courage, self-respect, integrity, and self-esteem. These are the qualities of grace that come directly from a soul with stamina."
13052,"Get bored with your past, it's over!"
13053,"Forgiveness, quite frankly, is the most selfish thing you can do. Because it is the greatest thing you can do for yourself."
13054,"Act on your inner guidance, and give up your need for 'proof' that your inner guidance is authentic. The more you ask for proof, the less likely you are to receive any."
13055,"The moment you come to trust chaos, you see God clearly. Chaos is divine order, versus human order. Change is divine order, versus human order. When the chaos becomes safety to you, then you know you're seeing God clearly."
13056,Whatever is in me is stronger than what is out there to defeat me.
13057,"Between thinking and seeing, there is a place called knowing."
13058,"Whenever you become empowered,
you will be tested."
13059,"If anyone tries to complicate your life, turn and walk away from them."
13060,"Healing... is an active and internal process that includes investigating one's attitudes, memories and beliefs with the desire to release all negative patterns that prevent one's full emotional and spiritual recovery.  This internal review inevitably leads one to review one's external circumstances in an effort to recreate one's life in a way that serves activation of will - the will to see and accept truths about one's life and how one has used one's energies; and the will to begin to use energy for the creation of love, self-esteem, and health."
13061,"Being of service is not an option, it is a biological necessity. Every kind of action we do for someone is a reanimation of our own life force - and of the other person's."
13062,
13063,"The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts, while the stupid ones are full of confidence."
13064,
13065,Wherever the crowd goes run in the other direction. They're always wrong.
13066,"People are strange: They are constantly angered by trivial things, but on a major matter like totally wasting their lives, they hardly seem to notice."
13067,what matters most is how well you walk through the fire
13068,"If something burns your soul with purpose and desire, it’s your duty to be reduced to ashes by it. Any other form of existence will be yet another dull book in the library of life."
13069,Find what you love and let it kill you.
13070,Intellectuals say simple things in difficult ways. Artists say difficult things in simple ways.
13071,The difference between a democracy and a dictatorship is that in a democracy you vote first and take orders later; in a dictatorship you don't have to waste your time voting.
13072,"If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even start."
13073,
13074,The wisest thing to do if you’re living in hell is to make yourself comfortable.
13075,Don't fight your demons. Your demons are here to teach you lessons. Sit down with your demons and have a drink and a chat and learn their names and talk about the burns on their fingers and scratches on their ankles. Some of them are very nice.
13076,"Some people like what you do, some people hate what you do, but most people simply don't give a damn."
13077,"I think that the world should be full of cats and full of rain, that's all, just cats and rain, rain and cats, very nice, good night."
13078,"Slavery was never abolished, it was only extended to include all the colors."
13079,"Simplicity is always the secret, to a profound truth, to doing things, to writing, to painting. Life is profound in its simplicity"
13080,"I stopped looking for a Dream Girl, I just wanted one that wasn't a nightmare."
13081,"I see men assassinated around me every day. I walk through rooms of the dead, streets of the dead, cities of the dead; men without eyes, men without voices; men with manufactured feelings and standard reactions; men with newspaper brains, television souls and high school ideas."
13082,You have to die a few times before you can really live.
13083,Beware of those who seek constant crowds; they are nothing alone.
13084,nobody can save you but yourself and you’re worth saving. it’s a war not easily won but if anything is worth winning then this is it.
13085,"I was laying in bed one night and I thought 'I'll just quit - to hell with it.' And another little voice inside me said 'Don't quit - save that tiny little ember of spark.' And never give them that spark because as long as you have that spark, you can start the greatest fire again."
13086,"The world is full of boring, identical and mindless people."
13087,
13088,"The most important thing in life is to stop saying 'I wish' and start saying 'I will.' Consider nothing impossible, then treat possibilities as probabilities."
13089,My advice is to never do tomorrow what you can do today. Procrastination is the thief of time.
13090,
13091,
13092,Do all the good you can and make as little fuss about it as possible.
13093,"Happiness is a gift and the trick is not to expect it, but to delight in it when it comes."
13094,No one is useless in this world who lightens the burden of it to anyone else.
13095,A man is lucky if he is the first love of a woman. A woman is lucky if she is the last love of a man.
13096,The world belongs to those who set out to conquer it armed with self confidence and good humour.
13097,We never tire of the friendships we form with books.
13098,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair."
13099,We forge the chains we wear in life.
13100,The whole difference between construction and creation is exactly this: that a thing constructed can only be loved after it is constructed; but a thing created is loved before it exists.
13101,"The sun himself is weak when he first rises, and gathers strength and courage as the day gets on."
13102,"True love believes everything, and bears everything, and trusts everything."
13103,"Time and tide will wait for no man, saith the adage. But all men have to wait for time and tide."
13104,"The American elite is almost beyond redemption. . . . Moral relativism has set in so deeply that the gilded classes have become incapable of discerning right from wrong. Everything can be explained away, especially by journalists. Life is one great moral mush--sophistry washed down with Chardonnay. The ordinary citizens, thank goodness, still adhere to absolutes.... It is they who have saved the republic from creeping degradation while their 'betters' were derelict."
13105,The worst of all listeners is the man who does nothing but listen.
13106,There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor.

13120,"It doesn't matter if you try and try and try again, and fail. It does matter if you try and fail, and fail to try again."
13121,here is a great difference between knowing a thing and understanding it. You can know a lot and not really understand anything.
13122,"Keep on going and the chances are you will stumble on something, perhaps when you are least expecting it. I have never heard of anyone stumbling on something sitting down."
13123,The whole fun of living is trying to make something better.
13124,"Every great improvement has come after repeated failures. Virtually nothing comes out right the first time. Failures, repeated failures, are finger posts on the road to achievement. One fails forward toward success."
13125,99 percent of success is built on failure.
13126,"All human development, no matter what form it takes, must be outside the rules; otherwise we would never have anything new."
13127,No one would have crossed the ocean if he could have gotten off the ship in the storm.
13128,"Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need."
13129,"Research means that you don't know, but are willing to find out."
13130,"It is the 'follow through' that makes the great difference between ultimate success and failure, because it is so easy to stop."
13131,Our imagination is the only limit to what we can hope to have in the future.
13132,An inventor is simply a fellow who doesn't take his education too seriously.
13133,"This problem, too, will look simple after it is solved."
13134,I think that the greatest education in the world is the education which helps one to be able to do the right things at the time it has to be done.
13135,I don't want men of experience working for me. The experienced man is always telling me why something can't be done. The fellow who has not had any experience is so dumb he doesn't know a thing can't be done - and he goes ahead and does it.
13136,"Action without intelligence is a form of insanity, but intelligence without action is the greatest form of stupidity in the world."
13137,
13138,"You may fear that the Lord has passed you by, but it is not so: he who counts the stars, and calls them by their names, is in no danger of forgetting his own children. He knows your case as thoroughly as if you were the only creature he ever made, or the only saint he ever loved. Approach him and be at peace."
13139,"The Word of God is like a lion. You don't have to defend a lion. All you have to do is let the lion loose, and the lion will defend itself."
13140,"Whatever a man depends upon, whatever rules his mind, whatever governs his affections, whatever is the chief object of his delight, is his god."
13141,"The Bible is not the light of the world, it is the light of the Church. But the world does not read the Bible, the world reads Christians! “You are the light of the world.”"
13142,"My faith rests not in what I am, or shall be, or feel, or know, but in what Christ is, in what he has done, and in what he is doing for me."
13143,"It is not a matter of time so much as a matter of heart; if you have the heart to pray, you will find the time."
13144,"God is too good to be unkind and He is too wise to be mistaken. And when we cannot trace His hand, we must trust His heart. When you are so weak that you cannot do much more than cry, you coin diamonds with both your eyes. The sweetest prayers God ever hears are the groans and sighs of those who have no hope in anything but his love."
13145,"When God places a burden upon you, He places His arms underneath you."
13146,You will never know God's strength until He has supported you in deep waters.
13147,Live in such a way that men may recognize that you have been with Jesus.
13148,"Child of God, you cost Christ too much for him to forget you."
13149,"Without the Spirit of God, we can do nothing. We are as ships without wind. We are useless."
13150,"Wherever Jesus may lead us, He goes before us. If we don't know where we are going, we know with whom we go."
13151,"If any man thinks ill of you, do not be angry with him, for you are worse than he thinks you to be."
13152,"Jesus wept, but He never complained."
13153,I believe that one reason why the church of God at this present moment has so little influence over the world is because the world has so much influence over the church.
13154,"Man was made in the image of God, and nothing will satisfy man but God, in whose image he was made."
13155,"Whenever God means to make a man great, he always breaks him in pieces first."
13156,"I know of no better thermometer to your spiritual temperature than this, the measure of the intensity of your prayer."
13157,"You and I cannot be useful if we want to be sweet as honey in the mouths of men. God will never bless us if we wish to please men, that they may think well of us. Are you willing to tell them what will break your own heart in the telling and break theirs in the hearing? If not, you are not fit to serve the Lord. You must be willing to go and speak for God, though you will be rejected."
13158,Nearness to God brings likeness to God. The more you see God the more of God will be seen in you.
13159,The greatest enemy to human souls is the self-righteous spirit which makes men look to themselves for salvation.
13160,"God does not need your strength: he has more than enough of power of his own. He asks your weakness: he has none of that himself, and he is longing, therefore, to take your weakness, and use it as the instrument in his own mighty hand. Will you not yield your weakness to him, and receive his strength?"
13161,You will never know the fullness of Christ until you know the emptiness of everything but Christ.
13162,
13163,"The news is not about news anymore. It's about protecting some people, destroying others and shoving a socialist agenda down the collective throats of America."
13164,"You'd better watch where you go, and remember where you've been"
13165,"I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ... if I can't take him with me, I don't want to go."
13166,What this world needs is a few more Rednecks.
13167,"As in the case of California, the wolf is at the door of America and the present administration acts as if it's a pussycat. America cannot maintain the present entitlement programs and support a government this size and keep on living on a credit card."
13168,"Just take them rascals [rapists, killers, child abusers] out in the swamp / Put 'em on their knees and tie 'em to a stump / Let the rattlers and the bugs and the alligators do the rest."
13169,"The United States of America took a giant step toward a totalitarian socialist government when the Supreme Court voted to uphold Obamacare, allowing the individual mandate for the government to force American citizens to buy health insurance whether they want to or not."
13170,Marry somebody you love. That's the whole thing. And continue to love them.
13171,I couldn't care less about politically correct.
13172,"I've been to Iraq three times. I've been to Afghanistan, I've been quite a few places, and I want to tell you something, these kids, they're the best we've got. They're the best Americans, they're the most loyal Americans we've got. And we owe them when they come back."
13173,I don't know where the time went. I sure have enjoyed it.
13174,I don't want to go anywhere where Jesus can't go.
13175,"Well, I just can't play the game anymore. I'm 63 years old, and I've been in the business for 40 years now. I take good advice and direction really well, but I don't need somebody that finished college two years ago to come in and tell me what I should be recording."
13176,I ain't askin' nobody for nuttin' if I cain't get it on my own.
13177,"I think we should keep voting, I think we should keep supporting things that we believe in. I don't think we ought to just quit."
13178,"So say it loud and let it ring We are all a part of everything The future, present and the past Fly on proud bird You're free at last"
13179,I just thank God I can make a living doing something I enjoy as much as I do playing music.
13180,I can't imagine not having a reason to get out of bed at night.
13181,"You marry somebody you love, that you feel like you want to spend the rest of your life with, that you're excited to wake up with every morning if you enjoy spending the day with. Right now... my wife is my best friend, by far my best friend."
13182,"People say, ""Well, we're all just going to die and go to heaven anyway, or Jesus is going to come back"" or something. I don't feel like God wants us just to lay down and die just because that's going to happen. I think we should keep trying."
13183,"A friend of mine, that I had known for some time, came up one day with an old guitar. I don't know where he got it, I don't know how long he'd had it, but he knew about two chords on it. He proceeded to teach them to me, and then we proceeded to go crazy over music."
13184,"Make sure to be honest with yourself, about if that's really what you want to do with your life - to make music. It takes a commitment - a tremendous, thick-skinned commitment of being the first one to get there and the last one to leave, doing what you want to do even if you have to work twice as hard as anybody else ever did."
13185,"We didn't have a garage to rehearse in. We had to aggravate the folks in the house. But I got a chance to play in a beer joint, and that's how it started."
13186,"I had been on the road for a long time and was not really getting anywhere. Bob Johnston, a friend of mine, had taken over Columbia in Nashville. He asked me if I wanted to come down. I did - thank God I did."
13187,
13188,"Crying does not indicate that you are weak. Since birth, it has always been a sign that you are alive."
13189,The shadows are as important as the light.
13190,"Better to try all things and find all empty, than to try nothing and leave your life a blank."
13191,"I try to avoid looking forward or backward, and try to keep looking upward."
13192,Beauty is in the eye of the gazer.
13193,"The idea of seeing the sea - of being near it - watching its changes by sunrise, sunset, moonlight, and noonday - in calm, perhaps in storm - fills and satisfies my mind."
13194,Your will shall decide your destiny.
13195,Better to be without logic than without feeling.
13196,"Prejudices, it is well known, are most difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened or fertilized by education; they grow firm there, firm as weeds among stones."
13197,"There is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow creatures, and feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort."

13203,Adversity is a good school.
13204,"Youth has its romance, and maturity its wisdom, as morning and spring have their freshness, noon and summer their power, night and winter their repose. Each attribute is good in its own season."
13205,"A great deal; you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way; they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should - so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again."
13206,Remorse is the poison of life.
13207,But life is a battle: may we all be enabled to fight it well!
13208,Look twice before you leap.
13209,Conventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not religion. To attack the first is not to assail the last.
13210,The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator.
13211,It is not violence that best overcomes hate -- nor vengeance that most certainly heals injury.
13212,
13213,"Nobody's going to do your life for you. You have to do it yourself, whether you're rich or poor, out of money or raking it in, the beneficiary of ridiculous fortune or terrible injustice. And you have to do it no matter what is true. No matter what is hard. No matter what unjust, sad, sucky things befall you. Self-pity is a dead-end road. You make the choice to drive down it. It's up to you to decide to stay parked there or to turn around and drive out."
13214,Don't surrender all your joy for an idea you used to have about yourself that isn't true anymore.
13215,"Whatever happens to you belongs to you. Make it yours. Feed it to yourself even if it feels impossible to swallow. Let it nurture you, because it will."
13216,"If someone is being unkind or petty or jealous or distant or weird, you don't have to take it in. You don't have to turn it into a big psychodrama about your worth. That behavior so often is not even about you. Don't own other people's crap."
13217,"Love is our essential nutrient. Without it, life has little meaning. It's the best thing we have to give and the most valuable thing we receive. It's worthy of all the hullabaloo."
13218,"Nobody will protect you from your suffering. You can't cry it away or eat it away or starve it away or walk it away or punch it away or even therapy it away. It's just there, and you have to survive it. You have to endure it. You have to live through it and love it and move on and be better for it and run as far as you can in the direction of your best and happiest dreams across the bridge that was built by your own desire to heal."
13219,"I knew that if I allowed fear to overtake me, my journey was doomed. Fear, to a great extent, is born of a story we tell ourselves, and so I chose to tell myself a different story from the one women are told. I decided I was safe. I was strong. I was brave. Nothing could vanquish me."
13220,You will come to know things that can only be known with the wisdom of age and the grace of years. Most of those things will have to do with forgiveness.
13221,You cannot convince people to love you. This is an absolute rule. No one will ever give you love because you want him or her to give it. Real love moves freely in both directions. Don’t waste your time on anything else.
13222,My mom said there's a sunrise and a sunset every day and you can choose to be there or not. You can put yourself in the way of beauty.
13223,The only way out of a hole is to climb out.
13224,Run as far as you can in the direction of your best and happiest dreams across the bridge that was built by your own desire to heal.
13225,"Fear, to a great extent, is born of a story we tell ourselves."
13226,"I asked, often out loud: Who is tougher than me? The answer was always the same, and even when I knew absolutely there was no way on this earth that it was true, I said it anyway: No one."
13227,The useless days will add up to something. The shitty waitressing jobs. The hours writing in your journal. The long meandering walks. The hours reading poetry and story collections and novels and dead people’s diaries and wondering about sex and God and whether you should shave under your arms or not. These things are your becoming.
13228,"The father’s job is to teach his children how to be warriors, to give them the confidence to get on the horse to ride into battle when it’s necessary to do so. If you don’t get that from your father, you have to teach yourself."
13229,"The story of human intimacy is one of constantly allowing ourselves to see those we love most deeply in a new, more fractured light. Look hard. Risk that."
13230,"Uncertain as I was as I pushed forward. I felt right in my pushing, as if the effort itself meant something."
13231,Self-pity is a dead-end road. You make the choice to drive down it. It's up to you to decide to stay parked there or to turn around and drive out.
13232,"So much of what I've learned, so much of what's good in my life, was learned because something bad happened, or from making the wrong decision. Through bad decisions I learned how to find the ways to make the right ones."
13233,The place of true healing is a fierce place. It's a giant place. it's a place of monstrous beauty and endless dark and glimmering light.
13234,"It was my life — like all lives, mysterious and irrevocable and sacred. So very close, so very present, so very belonging to me. How wild it was, to let it be."
13235,"I'd finally come to understand what it had been: a yearning for a way out, when actually what I had wanted to find was a way in."
13236,"If, as a culture, we don’t bear witness to grief, the burden of loss is placed entirely upon the bereaved, while the rest of us avert our eyes and wait for those in mourning to stop being sad, to let go, to move on, to cheer up. And if they don’t — if they have loved too deeply, if they do wake each morning thinking, I cannot continue to live — well, then we pathologize their pain; we call their suffering a disease. We do not help them: we tell them that they need to get help."
13237,
13238,Old breed? New breed? There's not a damn bit of difference so long as it's the Marine breed.
13239,"So they've got us surrounded, good! Now we can fire in any direction, those b*****ds won't get away this time!"
13240,We're surrounded. That simplifies the problem!
13241,"Take me to the Brig. I want to see the ""real Marines""."
13242,I want to go where the guns are!
13243,There are not enough chinamen in the world to stop a fully armed Marine regiment from going where ever they want to go.
13244,"The mail service has been excellent out here, and in my opinion this is all that the Air Force has accomplished during the war."
13245,Where the hell do you put the bayonet?
13246,

13249,"If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?"
13250,"Reject the basic assumptions of civilization, especially the importance of material possessions."
13251,"Until you find something to fight for, you settle for something to fight against."
13252,Every woman is just a different kind of problem.
13253,Recycling and speed limits are bullshit. They're like someone who quits smoking on his deathbed.
13254,
13255,
13256,"Find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who calls you back when you hang up on him, who will lie under the stars and listen to your heartbeat, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep...wait for the boy who kisses your forehead, who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats, who holds your hand in front of his friends, who thinks you're just as pretty without makeup on. One who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares and how lucky his is to have you....The one who turns to his friends and says, 'that's her.'"
13257,Why do I do anything?' she says. 'I'm educated enough to talk myself out of any plan. To deconstruct any fantasy. Explain away any goal. I'm so smart I can negate any dream.
13258,"If you don't know what you want, you end up with a lot you don't."
13259,"You see, life only turns out good or bad for only a little bit. And then it turns out some other way."
13260,Your past is just a story. And once you realize this it has no power over you.
13261,
13262,"If you knew that your life was merely a phase or short, short segment of your entire existence, how would you live? Knowing nothing 'real' was at risk, what would you do? You'd live a gigantic, bold, fun, dazzling life. You know you would. That's what the ghosts want us to do - all the exciting things they no longer can."
13263,"Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it."
13264,You're always haunted by the idea you're wasting your life.
13265,"People don't listen, they just wait for their turn to talk."
13266,What do you do when your entire identity is destroyed in an instant? How do you cope when your whole life story turns out to bw wrong?
13267,"The one you love and the one who loves you are never, ever the same person."
13268,We can spend our lives letting the world tell us who we are. Sane or insane. Saints or sex addicts. Heroes or victims. Letting history tell us how good or bad we are. Letting our past decide our future. Or we can decide for ourselves. And maybe it's our job to invent something better.
13269,The difference between how you look and how you see yourself is enough to kill most people. And maybe the reason vampires don’t die is because they can never see themselves in photographs or mirrors.
13270,People are all over the world telling their one dramatic story and how their life has turned into getting over this one event. Now their lives are more about the past than their future.
13271,
13272,
13273,
13274,"I don't look at my life too much. I'm always looking forward, not backward."
13275,Participating in a gun buy-back program because you think that criminals have too many guns is like having yourself castrated because you think your neighbors have too many kids.
13276,
13277,One day we will look back and realize that the Barack Obama Presidency was the biggest fraud ever perpetrated on the American people.
13278,You have to be realistic about where you are in life and enjoy it.
13279,"Improvise, Adapt and Overcome!"
13280,"You're as young as you feel. As young as you want to be. There's an old saying I heard from a friend of mine. People ask him, ""Why do you look so good at your age?"" He'll say, ""Because I never let the old man in."" And there's truth to that. It's in your mind, how far you let him come in."
13281,I've never met a genius. A genius to me is someone who does well at something he hates. Anybody can do well at something he loves - it's just a question of finding the subject.
13282,Nothing wrong with shooting...as long as the right people get shot.
13283,They say marriages are made in Heaven. But so is thunder and lightning.
13284,"Extremism is so easy. You've got your position, and that's it. It doesn't take much thought. And when you go far enough to the right you meet the same idiots coming around from the left."
13285,"Opinions are like a**holes, everybody has one."
13286,"If you want a guarantee, buy a toaster."
13287,"Secretly everybody's getting tired of political correctness, kissing up. That's the kiss-ass generation we're in right now. We're really in a pussy generation. Everybody's walking on eggshells. We see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff. When I grew up, those things weren't called racist."
13288,"I am not a regret type person. I don't believe in regrets. Lots of things you would do differently if you'd do it again, but you don't do it again, so you don't think about it. But that goes for life in general. You're only dealing with the knowledge you have at that time."
13289,"Maybe I`m getting to the age when I`m starting to be senile or nostalgic or both, but people are so angry now. You used to be able to disagree with people and still be friends. Now you hear these talk shows, and everyone who believes differently from you is a moron and an idiot - both on the Right and the Left."

13311,"Beauty Should Begin in the Heart and Soul, otherwise cosmetics are useless."
13312,"You cannot keep up a nightlife and amount to anything in the day. You cannot indulge in those foods and liquors that destroy the physique and still hope to have a physique that functions with the minimum of destruction to itself. A candle burnt at both ends may shed a brighter light, but the darkness that follows is for a longer time."
13313,You live but once; you might as well be amusing.

13319,"Sin can be forgiven, but stupid is forever."
13320,A woman does not become interesting until she is over 40.
13321,
13322,Leadership is solving problems. The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help or concluded you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership.
13323,"1. It ain't as bad as you think. It will look better in the morning.
2. Get mad, then get over it.
3. Avoid having your ego so close to your position that when your position falls, your ego goes with it.
4. It can be done!
5. Be careful what you choose. You may get it.
6. Don't let adverse facts stand in the way of a good decision.

13326,
13327,"Pissing people off doesn't mean you're doing the right things, but doing the right things will almost inevitably piss people off."
13328,"Never receive counsel from unproductive people. Never discuss your problems 
 with someone incapable of contributing to the solution, because those who 
 never succeed themselves are always first to tell you how. Not everyone has 
 a right to speak into your life. You are certain to get the worst of the 
 bargain when you exchange ideas with the wrong person. Don't follow anyone 
 who's not going anywhere."
13329,
13330,"When we are debating an issue, loyalty means giving me your honest opinion, whether you think I'll like it or not. Disagreement, at this state, stimulates me. But once a decision is made, the debate ends. From that point on, loyalty means executing the decision as if it were your own."
13331,"Good leaders set vision, missions, and goals.  Great leaders inspire every follower at every level to internalize their purpose, and to understand that their purpose goes far beyond the mere details of their job.  When everyone is united in purpose, a positive purpose that serves not only the organization but also, hopefully, the world beyond it, you have a winning team."
13332,"The less you associate with some people, the more your life will improve. Any time you tolerate mediocrity in others, it increases your mediocrity. An important attribute in successful people is their impatience with negative thinking and negative acting people."
13333,"Don't just show kindness in passing or to be courteous.  Show it in depth, show it with passion, and expect nothing in return.  Kindness is not just about being nice; it's about recognizing another human being who deserves care and respect."
13334,"The most important thing I learned is that soldiers watch what their leaders do. You can give them classes and lecture them forever, but it is your personal example they will follow."
13335,Always do your best. Somebody is watching you.
13336,"Treat people kindly. When you are kind to somebody and I don't mean necessarily ""buddy-buddy"", just show kindness and consideration. Show that people are worthy and you respect them and you are glad they're with you."
13337,"Always show more kindness than seems necessary, because the person receiving it needs it more than you will ever know."
13338,"We have to start thinking of America as a family. We have to stop screeching screeching at each other, stop hurting each other, and instead start caring for, sacrificing for and sharing with each other ... We cannot move forward if cynics and critics swoop down and pick apart anything that goes wrong, to a point where we lose sight of what is right, decent and uniquely good about America."
13339,"You can never err by treating everyone in the building with respect, thoughtfulness, and a kind word.  Everyone of our employees is an essential employee.  Every one of them wants to be viewed that way.  And if you treat them that way, they will view you that way.  They will not let you down or let you fail.  They will accomplish whatever you have put in front of them."
13340,Trying to get everyone to like you is a sign of mediocrity.
13341,
13342,"Look for intelligence and judgment and, most critically, a capacity to anticipate, to see around corners. Also look for loyalty, integrity, a high energy drive, a balanced ego and the drive to get things done."
13343,
13344,One of the greatest talents of all is the talent to recognize and to develop talent in others.
13345,"Being kind doesn't mean being soft or a wuss.  Kindness is not a sign of weakness.  It is a sign of confidence.  If you have developed a reputation for kindness and consideration, then even the most unpleasant decisions will go down easier because everyone will understand why you are doing what you are doing.  They will realize that your decision must be necessary, and is not arbitrary or without empathy.  As the old saying puts it, 'To the world, you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.'"
13346,
13347,In old days men studied for the sake of self-improvement; nowadays men study in order to impress other people.

13355,"Tell people - and they may forget... 
 show them - they may remember... 
 but involve them and they will understand."

13366,"Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves."
13367,Expect much from yourself and little from others and you will avoid incurring resentments
13368,"Attack the evil that is within yourself, rather than attacking the evil that is in others."
13369,Of course you want to be rich and famous. It's natural. Wealth and fame are what every man desires. The question is: What are you willing to trade for it?
13370,"If you chase two rabbits, 
 you catch none."
13371,
13372,"Worrying is carrying tomorrow's load with today's strength- carrying two days at once. It is moving into tomorrow ahead of time. Worrying doesn't empty tomorrow of its sorrow, it empties today of its strength."
13373,
13374,"The wonderful thing about praying is that you leave a world of not being able to do something, and enter God’s realm where everything is possible. He specializes in the impossible. Nothing is too great for His almighty power. Nothing is too small for His love."
13375,
13376,"When a train goes through a tunnel and it gets dark, you don't throw away the ticket and jump off. You sit still and trust the engineer."

13378,In order to realize the worth of the anchor we need to feel the stress of the storm.
13379,"Faith sees the invisible, believes the unbelievable, and receives the impossible."
13380,"Hold loosely to the things of this life, so that if God requires them of you, it will be easy to let them go."
13381,"You can never learn that Christ is all you need, until Christ is all you have."
13382,Forgiveness is the key that unlocks the door of resentment and the handcuffs of hatred. It is a power that breaks the chains of bitterness and the shackles of selfishness.
13383,
13384,"This is what the past is for! Every experience God gives us, every person He puts in our lives is the perfect preparation for the future that only He can see."
13385,"I prayed to dispel my fear, until suddenly, and I do not know how the idea came to me, I began to pray for others. I prayed for everyone who came into my thoughts - - people with whom I had traveled, those who had been in prison with me, my school friends of years ago. I do not know how long I continued my prayer, but this I do know - - my fear was gone! Interceding for others had released me!"

13392,"When we are on the beach we only see a small part of the ocean. However, we know that there is much more beyond the horizon. We only see a small part of God's great love, a few jewels of His great riches, but we know that there is much more beyond the horizon. The best is yet to come, when we see Jesus face-to-face."
13393,"When a Christian shuns fellowship with other Christians, the devil smiles, When he stops studying the Bible, the devil laughs. When he stops praying, the devils shouts for joy."
13394,Forgiveness is not an emotion; it is an act of the will.
13395,"Do you know what hurts so very much? It's love. Love is the strongest force in the world, and when it is blocked that means pain. There are two things we can do when this happens. We can kill that love so that it stops hurting. But then of course part of us dies, too. Or we can ask God to open up another route for that love to travel."
13396,
13397,
13398,
13399,"Don't ever mistake my silence for ignorance, my calmness for acceptance or my kindness for weakness. Compassion and tolerance are not a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength."
13400,"Man surprised me most about humanity.Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health.And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived."
13401,"Give the ones you love wings to fly, roots to come back and reasons to stay."

13405,"Every day, think as you wake up, today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart out to others; to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. I am going to have kind thoughts towards others, I am not going to get angry or think badly about others. I am going to benefit others as much as I can."
13406,"Our prime purpose in this life is to help others. And if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them."
13407,"Whether one is rich or poor, educated or illiterate, religious or nonbelieving, man or woman, black, white, or brown, we are all the same. Physically, emotionally, and mentally, we are all equal. We all share basic needs for food, shelter, safety, and love. We all aspire to happiness and we all shun suffering. Each of us has hopes, worries, fears, and dreams. Each of us wants the best for our family and loved ones. We all experience pain when we suffer loss and joy when we achieve what we seek.

13439,"Remember, happiness doesn't depend upon who you are or what you have; it depends solely upon what you think. So start each day by thinking of all the things you have to be thankful for. Your future will depend very largely on the thoughts you think today. So think thoughts of hope and confidence and love and success."

13449,"The greatest issue facing the world today, with all its heartbreaking needs, is whether those who, by profession or culture, are identified as ‘Christians’ will become disciples – students, apprentices, practitioners – of Jesus Christ, steadily learning from him how to live the life of the Kingdom of the Heavens into every corner of human existence."
13450,
13451,A disciple is a person who has decided that the most important thing in their life is to learn how to do what Jesus said to do.

13456,The ultimate freedom we have as human beings is the power to select what we will allow or require our minds to dwell upon.
13457,"Consumer Christianity is now normative. The consumer Christian is one who utilizes the grace of God for forgiveness and the services of the church for special occasions, but does not give his or her life and innermost thoughts, feelings, and intentions over to the kingdom of the heavens. Such Christians are not inwardly transformed and not committed to it."
13458,"Every church needs to be able to answer two questions. First, what is our plan for making disciples? And second, does our plan work?"
13459,
13460,"If we do not make formation in Christ the priority, then we're just going to keep on producing Christians that are indistinguishable in their character from many non-Christians."
13461,"A disciple is a learner, a student, an apprentice – a practitioner… Disciples of Jesus are people who do not just profess certain views as their own but apply their growing understanding of life in the Kingdom of the Heavens to every aspect of their life on earth."

13466,"The will is transformed by experience, not information."
13467,
13468,"What Paul is clearly saying is that if anyone is worthy of being saved, they will be saved. At that point many Christians get very anxious, saying that absolutely no one is worthy of being saved. The implication of that is that a person can be almost totally good, but miss the message about Jesus, and be sent to hell. What kind of a God would do that? I am not going to stand in the way of anyone whom God wants to save. I am not going to say 'he can't save them.' I am happy for God to save anyone he wants in any way he can. It is possible for someone who does not know Jesus to be saved."
13469,"As Augustine say clearly, God being God offends human pride. If God is running the universe and has first claim on our lives, guess who isn't running the universe and does not get to have things as they please."
13470,"Jesus, Willard says, “does not call us to do what he did, but to be as he was, permeated with love. Then the doing of what he did and said becomes the natural expression of who we are in him."

13472,You don't have to control your thoughts; you just have to stop letting them control you.
13473,"Every positive change - every jump to a higher level of energy and awareness - involves a rite of passage. Each time to ascend to a higher rung on the ladder of personal evolution, we must go through a period of discomfort, of initiation. I have never found an exception."

13483,"Wake up! If you knew for certain you had a terminal illness--if you had little time left to live--you would waste precious little of it! Well, I'm telling you...you do have a terminal illness: It's called birth. You don't have more than a few years left. No one does! So be happy now, without reason--or you will never be at all."
13484,"Surrender means accepting this moment, this body, and this life with open arms. Surrender involves getting out of your own way and living in accord with a higher will, expressed as the wisdom of the heart. Far more than passive acceptance, surrender uses every challenge as a means of spiritual growth and expanded awareness."
13485,"The secret of change consists in concentrating one's energy to create the new, and not to fight against the old."
13486,The universe does not judge us; it only provides consequences and lessons and opportunities to balance and learn through the law of cause and effect. Compassion is the recognition that we are each doing the best we can within the limits of our current beliefs and capacities.
13487,"We are both burdened and blessed by the great responsibility of the will - the power of choice. Our future is determined, in large part, by the choices we make now. We cannot always control our circumstances, but we can and do choose our response to whatever arises. Reclaiming the power of choice, we find the courage to live fully in the world."
13488,There is no path to Happiness. Happiness is the path. There is no path to Love. Love is the path. There is no path to Peace. Peace is the path.
13489,Stress happens when your mind resists what is...The only problem in your life is your mind's resistance to life as it unfolds.
13490,"If you don't get what you want, you suffer; if you get what you don't want, you suffer; even when you get exactly what you want, you still suffer because you can't hold on to it forever."
13491,"Your fears are not walls, but hurdles. Courage is not the absence of fear, but the conquering of it."
13492,The seasons do not push one another; neither do clouds race the wind across the sky. All things happen in their own good time.
13493,"If babies held the same tendency toward self-criticism as adults, they might never learn to walk or talk. Can you imagine infants stomping, 'Aarggh! Screwed up again!' Fortunately, babies are free of self-criticism. They just keep practicing."
13494,"Ultimately, fear of failure generates a vicious circle that creates what is most feared. To break this cycle, you need to make peace with failure. It isn't enough to merely tolerate it; you need to appreciate the failure and use it."
13495,Everything you need to know is within you. Listen. Feel. Trust the body's wisdom.
13496,
13497,"Working hard is important. But there is something that matters even more, believing in yourself."

13500,"I'm very comfortable discussing my personal life, because it's so boring."
13501,There's no shame in enjoying the quiet life.
13502,Don't try too hard to be something you're not.
13503,There's never enough time to do nothing!
13504,"I'm not an easy person to love. There are lots of times when I'm a very good boyfriend, but there are times when I'm useless. I mean, I'm a mess around the house. I talk nonstop. I become obsessed with things."
13505,"I know I'm not a coal miner, but I do long hours and I never complain, and there is nowhere else I'd rather be. So, yeah, that's how I'd define myself. I want to do it right, and prove people wrong once and for all about the myth of child stars."
13506,"I will never, ever do a film as successful as the Harry Potter series. But neither will anyone else."
13507,"As much as I would love to be a person that goes to parties and has a couple of drinks and has a nice time - that doesn't work for me. I do that very unsuccessfully. I'd just rather sit at home and read, or go out to dinner with someone, or talk to someone I love, or talk to somebody that makes me laugh."
13508,"I used to be self conscious about my height, but then I thought, f*** that, I'm Harry Potter."
13509,"There's a lot of work that needs to be done, and there's a difference between talking the talk and walking the walk."
13510,"There is something inherently valuable about being a misfit. It's not to say that every person who has artistic talent was a social outcast, but there is definitely a value for identifying yourself differently and being proud that you are different."
13511,"I'm an atheist, but I'm very relaxed about it. I don't preach my atheism, but I have a huge amount of respect for people like Richard Dawkins who do."
13512,"Though I am not religious in the least, I am very proud to be Jewish."
13513,"I’m an atheist, and a militant atheist when religion starts impacting on legislation."
13514,"To the children who loved Harry Potter, I want to say your enthusiasm was the real magic. I so enjoyed being on the journey with you. And to the adults who bought the Harry Potter books and devoured them, I just want to say, those books were for children."
13515,You don't have to be gay to be a supporter- you just have to be a human.
13516,"If I die on a film set when I'm 80, I'll be happy with that."
13517,I don't want anyone to ever say that I don't belong where I am.
13518,"Well, I think I’m a feminist, just by the virtue of the fact that I believe in equal rights for everyone."
13519,What I learned is that acting is to a large extent about trying to stave off self-doubt long enough to be natural and real onstage.
13520,"I thought I was an actor playing a wizard. But really, I was a wizard playing an actor."
13521,
13522,"When you follow God's will for your life, you can see how yesterday's events prepared you for today's challenges and tomorrow's opportunities."
13523,"Prayer is the way you defeat the devil, reach the lost, restore a backslider, strengthen the saints, send missionaries out, cure the sick, accomplish the impossible, and know the will of God."

13530,"If you are a Christian, your search for approval should be over."
13531,"Every time we deny ourselves in order to serve someone else, we grow in Christ."
13532,"When you're facing all the issues of life and you don't know what to do, accept the fact that you are human. We all are. We don't have the capacity to understand Almighty God. But you know what? We know Jesus Christ. He's the wisdom of God. And He put His Holy Spirit in us. So having access to the Holy Spirit and Jesus, we can face the challenges of today with the wisdom of God."
13533,God is never early and never late.
13534,The promises of God are His guarantees amid life's uncertainties. They're the basis of all our life of faith.
13535,Integrity is keeping a commitment even after circumstances have changed.
13536,Our attitude toward others reveals our genuine attitude toward God.

13547,
13548,The human body has limitations. The human spirit is boundless.
13549,"The human body is capable of amazing physical deeds. If we could just free ourselves from our perceived limitations and tap into our internal fire, the possibilities are endless."
13550,"People think I'm crazy to put myself through such torture, though I would argue otherwise. Somewhere along the line we seem to have confused comfort with happiness... Dostoyevsky had it right: 'Suffering is the sole origin of consciousness.' Never are my senses more engaged than when the pain sets in. There is a magic in misery. Just ask any runner."
13551,"I run because if I didn’t, I’d be sluggish and glum and spend too much time on the couch. I run to breathe the fresh air. I run to explore. I run to escape the ordinary. I run…to savor the trip along the way. Life becomes a little more vibrant, a little more intense. I like that."
13552,"Even if you're inches away from the finish, never take success for granted."
13553,"A Marathon is not about running, it is about salvation. We spend so much of our lives doubting ourselves, thinking we're not good enough, not strong enough, not made of the right stuff. The Marathon is an opportunity for redemption. ""Opportunity,"" because the outcome is uncertain. ""Opportunity,"" because it is up to you, and only you, to make it happen; only you can turn your farfetched dream into a reality."
13554,"Listen to everyone, follow no one."
13555,"Don't run with your legs, run with your heart."
13556,"Unless you're not pushing yourself, you're not living to the fullest. You can't be afraid to fail, but unless you fail, you haven't pushed hard enough."""
13557,Any goal worth achieving involves an element of risk.
13558,"If you keep chasing your dreams, one day you'll catch them."
13559,Don't confuse comfort with happiness.
13560,"Most dreams die a slow death. They're conceived in a moment of passion, with the prospect of endless possibility, but often languish and are not pursued with the same heartfelt intensity as when first born. Slowly, subtly, a dream becomes elusive and ephemeral. People who've lost their own dreams become pessimists and cynics. They feel like the time and devotion spent on chasing their dreams were wasted. The emotional scars last forever."
13561,"Running is about finding your inner peace, and so is a life well lived."
13562,"Some seek the comfort of their therapist's office, other head to the corner pub and dive into a pint, but I chose running as my therapy."
13563,"I never feel more alive than when I'm in great pain, struggling against insurmountable odds and untold adversity. Hardship? Suffering? Bring it!"
13564,I run to breathe the fresh air. I run to explore. I run to escape the ordinary.
13565,"Once you permit yourself to compromise, you fail yourself."
13566,We have killed our souls with comfort instead of seeking fulfillment and achievement.
13567,"I wasn't born with any innate talent. I've never been naturally gifted at anything. I always had to work at it. The only way I knew how to succeed was to try harder than anyone else. Dogged persistence is what got me through life. But here was something I was half-decent at. Being able to run great distances was the one thing I could offer the world. Others might be faster, but I could go longer. My strongest quality is that I never give up."
13568,"I run because long after my footprints fade away, maybe I will have inspired a few to reject the easy path, hit the trails, put one foot in front of the other, and come to the same conclusion I did: I run because it always takes me where I want to go."
13569,"Running unites us and brings us together because, in the words of the great Bill Rogers, ""We sweat the same. We struggle the same."" Running is a simple, primitive act, and therein lays its power. for it is one of the few commonalities left between us as a human race. Toeing the starting line of a marathon, regardless of the language you speak, the God you worship or the color of your skin, we all stand as equal. Perhaps the world would be a better place if more people ran."
13570,There is magic in misery. Just ask any runner.
13571,
13572,"Be happy for no reason, like a child. If you are happy for a reason, you’re in trouble, because that reason can be taken from you."
13573,"If you want to be happy, make someone else happy. If you want to find the right person in your life, be the right person. If you want to see change in the world, become the change you want to see."
13574,"You alone are the judge of your worth and your goal is to discover infinite worth in yourself, no matter what anyone else thinks."
13575,
13576,The best use of imagination is creativity. The worst use of imagination is anxiety.
13577,"If you are having the experience of anxiety, your body is making adrenaline and cortisone, if you are having the experience of tranquility, your body starts making valium, if you are having the experience of exhilaration and joy, your body makes interleukins and interferons which are powerful anti-cancer drugs. So, your body is constantly converting your experiences into molecules."
13578,There is a light within each of us that can never be diminished or extinguished. It can only be obscured by forgetting who we are
13579,The soul knows everything. Be who you are and your life will transform forever.
13580,"Each of us plays four roles in relation to the brain. We lead, we inspire, we invent, and we use it. Most people do not actively use their brains. They passively let their feelings and thoughts control their lives. They don't invent new ways to use their brains, either, settling instead for the same routine and repetitive thoughts every day. But if you master all four roles, you create your super brain. When you are the active observer of your feelings and thoughts, you become the user of your brain. Your super brain then serves you, not vice versa."
13581,You give to the world your greatest gift when you're being yourself.
13582,In every failure lies the seeds of success.
13583,"Whatever relationships you have attracted in your life at this moment, are precisely the ones you need in your life at this moment. There is a hidden meaning behind all events, and this hidden meaning is serving your own evolution."
13584,You must find the place inside yourself where nothing is impossible.
13585,"According to Vedanta, there are only two symptoms of enlightenment, just two indications that a transformation is taking place within you toward a higher consciousness. The first symptom is that you stop worrying. Things don't bother you anymore. You become light hearted and full of joy. The second symptom is that you encounter more and more meaningful coincidences in your life, more and more synchronicities. And this accelerates to the point where you actually experience the miraculous."
13586,Negative emotions are like unwelcome guests. Just because they show up on our doorstep doesn't mean they have a right to stay.
13587,"When you meet someone, you can silently send them a blessing, wishing them happiness, joy and laughter. This kind of silent giving is very powerful."
13588,
13589,All great changes are preceded by chaos.
13590,
13591,"If you want to reach a state of bliss, then go beyond your ego and the internal dialogue. Make a decision to relinquish the need to control, the need to be approved, and the need to judge. Those are the three things the ego is doing all the time. It's very important to be aware of them every time they come up."
13592,The universe has much bigger plans for you than you ever dreamed of for yourself.
13593,"The Ego, however, is not who you really are. The ego is your self-image; it is your social mask; it is the role you are playing. Your social mask thrives on approval. It wants control, and it is sustained by power, because it lives in fear."
13594,"When you make a choice, you change the future."
13595,"If you focus on success, you’ll have stress. But if you pursue excellence, success will be guaranteed."
13596,

Whispering from every leaf, 
Singing from every river, 
Shimmering from every sky."
13602,"It is beautiful to talk about beautiful things
And even more beautiful to silently gaze at them."
13603,To say more while saying less is the secret of being simple.
13604,"I am the shore and the ocean, awaiting myself on both sides."
13605,"The world is always open, Waiting to be discovered."
13606,"If you are good, they say you are weak."
13607,Life eats life to live.
13608,Either you will be you or you will not be at all.
13609,"To accomplish the perfect perfection, a little imperfection helps."
13610,I recreate myself; that is my only power.
13611,"When within yourself you find the road, the right road will open."
13612,Do not look too far for you will see nothing.
13613,"Whatever others may say, they say it to deceive and comfort themselves, not help you."
13614,The world cannot be translated; It can only be dreamed of and touched.
13615,"Everybody talks, but there is no conversation."
13616,Even great men bow before the Sun; it melts hubris into humility.

13621,
13622,Learn from the past and share your experiences with others.

13624,
13625,
13626,Nothing is more beautiful than a smile that has struggled through tears
13627,At the end of the day it doesn't matter what anybody else thinks as long as you're happy.
13628,"Your imperfections make you beautiful, they make you who you are."
13629,"Your mind . . . can be your best friend or your worst enemy, but it's your choice to make."
13630,Don't let anything or anyone define you. You are what you are because of what you make of tough situations in your life.
13631,
13632,"Don't judge me. You know my name, but not my story."
13633,Share your story with someone. You never know how one sentence of your life story could inspire someone to rewrite their own.
13634,"It's gonna be okay, no matter how hard your rock bottom is, you can rise above it and you can come back."
13635,Love yourself before any other person. That's when you can really survive on your own.
13636,"Whatever you dream of doing one day, don't give up on that dream because you never know where it can take you."
13637,You really need to be careful of who you hang out with and who you listen to. They can lead you down the wrong path.
13638,"No matter what you're going through, there's a light at the end of the tunnel and it may seem hard to get to it but you can do it and just keep working towards it and you'll find the positive side of things."
13639,Expectations are just disappointments waiting to happen.
13640,"Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground"
13641,"I think scars are like battle wounds - beautiful, in a way. They show what you've been through and how strong you are for coming out of it."
13642,Be proud of who you are.
13643,"I don't let anyone's insecurities, emotions, or opinions bother me. I know that if I am happy, that's all that matters to me."
13644,"I prefer to cry alone, Pride? No. I just want to avoid trial of people who don't know the reason of my tears."
13645,"We do the best we can in life, we take things one day at a time and sometimes we all just need a simple reminder of that."
13646,
13647,"Don't tell people how to live, demonstrate by example."
13648,The most important opinion you'll ever have is the one you hold of yourself.

13650,"There are no mistakes or failures, only lessons."
13651,"Don't wait for an employer, friend, or mentor to show appreciation for your work. Take pride in your own efforts on a daily basis."
13652,You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization.
13653,"Learn from the past, set vivid, detailed goals for the future,and live in the only moment of time over which you have any control: now."
13654,Losers take chances; winners make choices.
13655,The real risk is doing nothing.
13656,"Mistakes are painful when they happen, but years later a collection of mistakes is what is called experience."
13657,Life is the movie you see through your own eyes.
13658,
13659,"Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, or worn. It is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace & gratitude."
13660,"Change the changeable, accept the unchangeable, and remove yourself from the unacceptable."
13661,"There are two primary choices in life: to accept conditions as they exist, or accept the responsibility for changing them."
13662,Success is almost totally dependent upon drive and persistence.
13663,"You must look within for value,
but must look beyond for perspective."
13664,"All of the top achievers I know are life-long learners. Looking for new skills, insights, and ideas. If they're not learning, they're not growing and not moving toward excellence."
13665,"Accept yourself as you are right now; an imperfect, changing, growing and worthy person."
13666,The most splendid achievement of all is the constant striving to surpass yourself and to be worthy of your own approval.
13667,"Chase your passion, not your pension."
13668,"Don't be a time manager, be a priority manager.  Cut your major goals into bite-sized pieces.  Each small priority or requirement on the way to ultimate goal become a mini goal in itself."
13669,Be willing to wait longer for you goals to bear fruit than you had anticipated.
13670,Stop stewing and start doing!
13671,
13672,
13673,
13674,There comes a point where we need to stop just pulling people out of the river. We need to go upstream and find out why they're falling in.
13675,
13676,"We are made for goodness. We are made for love. We are made for friendliness. We are made for togetherness. We are made for all of the beautiful things that you and I know. We are made to tell the world that there are no outsiders. All are welcome: black, white, red, yellow, rich, poor, educated, not educated, male, female, gay, straight, all, all, all. We all belong to this family, this human family, God's family."
13677,
13678,"One of the sayings in our country is Ubuntu - the essence of being human. Ubuntu speaks particularly about the fact that you can't exist as a human being in isolation. It speaks about our interconnectedness. You can't be human all by yourself, and when you have this quality - Ubuntu - you are known for your generosity. We think of ourselves far too frequently as just individuals, separated from one another, whereas you are connected and what you do affects the whole World. When you do well, it spreads out; it is for the whole of humanity."
13679,When the missionaries came to Africa they had the Bible and we had the land. They said 'Let us pray.' We closed our eyes. When we opened them we had the Bible and they had the land.
13680,"I can't control what happens to me, but I can control how I respond to it."
13681,How could you have a soccer team if all were goalkeepers? How would it be an orchestra if all were French horns?
13682,"If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor."
13683,The fundamental law of human beings is interdependence. A person is a person through other persons.
13684,"Africans believe in something that is difficult to render in English. We call it ubuntu, botho. It means the essence of being human. You know when it is there and when it is absent. It speaks about humaneness, gentleness, hospitality, putting yourself out on behalf of others, being vulnerable. It embraces compassion and toughness. It recognizes that my humanity is bound up in yours, for we can only be human together."
13685,"Our maturity will be judged by how well we are able to agree to disagree and yet continue to love one another, to care for one another, and cherish one another and seek the greater good of the other."
13686,"My father always used to say, ""Don't raise your voice. Improve your argument."""
13687,"Goodness is stronger than evil.
Love is stronger than hate.
Light is stronger than darkness.
Life is stronger than death.
Victory is ours through Him who loved us."
13688,"Religion is like a knife: you can either use it to cut bread, or stick in someone's back."
13689,Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning.
13690,To remain neutral in situations of injustice is to be complicit in that injustice.
13691,"Bringing people together is what i call 'ubuntu,' which means 'I am because we are.' Far too often people think of themselves as just individuals, separated from one another, whereas you are connected and what you do affects the whole world. When you do well, it spreads out; it is for the whole of humanity."
13692,"If we could but recognize our common humanity, that we do belong together, that our destinies are bound up in one another's, that we can be free only together, that we can be human only together, then a glorious world would come into being where all of us lived harmoniously together as members of one family, the human family."
13693,"There's no way in which you can ever win a war against terror. As long as there are conditions in many parts of the world that make people desperate: poverty, disease, ignorance, etc. I hope that we will discover soon, that we can survive, only together. We can prosper only together. And I think people are beginning to realize this, that you can't have pockets of prosperity in one part of the world and huge deserts of poverty and deprivation and think you can have a stable, secure world."
13694,"You don't choose your family. They are God's gift to you, as you are to them."
13695,If we are going to see real development in the world then our best investment is WOMEN!
13696,
13697,"No matter our circumstances, no matter our challenges or trials, there is something in each day to embrace and cherish. There is something in each day that can bring gratitude and joy if only we will see and appreciate it."
13698,The perfect place to begin is exactly where you are right now.
13699,You are stronger than you realize. You are more capable than you can imagine.
13700,"Don't think less of yourself, just think less about yourself."
13701,"Though we are incomplete, God loves us completely. Though we are imperfect, He loves us perfectly. Though we may feel lost and without compass, God's love encompasses us completely. ... He loves every one of us, even those who are flawed, rejected, awkward, sorrowful, or broken."
13702,"I do not believe in a God who would set up rules and commandments only to wait for us to fail so He could punish us. I believe in a Heavenly Father who is loving and caring and who rejoices in our every effort to stand tall and walk toward Him. Even when we stumble, He urges us not to be discouraged-never to give up or flee our allotted field of service-but to take courage, find our faith, and keep trying."
13703,"Sometimes we become so focused on the finish line, that we fail to find joy in the journey."
13704,"When it comes to hating, gossiping, ignoring, ridiculing, holding grudges, or wanting to cause harm, please apply the following: Stop it!"
13705,Doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith.
13706,"When our wagon gets stuck in the mud, God is much more likely to assist the man who gets out to push than the man who merely raises his voice in prayer—no matter how eloquent the oration."
13707,"Wherever you are, whatever your circumstances may be, you are not forgotten. No matter how dark your days may seem, no matter how insignificant you may feel, no matter how overshadowed you think you may be, your Heavenly Father has not forgotten you. In fact, He loves you with an infinite love."
13708,It is often in the trial of adversity that we learn those most critical lessons that form our character and shape our destiny.
13709,What we love determines what we seek. What we seek determines what we think and do. What we think and do determines who we are — and who we will become.
13710,"It is your reaction to adversity, not the adversity itself, that determines how your life’s story will develop."
13711,Don't let fear of failure discourage you. Don't let the voice of critics paralyze you - whether that voice comes from the outside or the inside.
13712,If we spend our days waiting for fabulous roses we could miss the beauty and wonder of the tiny forget-me-nots that are all around us.

13715,Never give up on anyone. And that includes not giving up on yourself.
13716,"The Lord doesn't expect us to work harder than we are able. He doesn't (nor should we) compare our efforts to those of others. Our Heavenly Father asks only that we do the best we can—that we work according to our full capacity, however great or small that may be."
13717,"By becoming the answer to someone's prayer, we often find the answer to our own."
13718,"The happiest people I know are not those who find their golden ticket; they are those who, while in pursuit of worthy goals, discover and treasure the beauty and sweetness of the everyday moments."
13719,"Yes, God loves you this very day and always. He is not waiting to love you until you have overcome your weaknesses and bad habits. He loves you today with a full understanding of your struggles. He is aware that you reach up to Him in heartfelt and hopeful prayer. He knows of the times you have held onto the fading light and believed-even in the midst of growing darkness. He knows of your sufferings. He knows of your remorse for the times you have fallen short or failed. And still He loves you."
13720,"True love requires action. We can speak of love all day long, we can write notes or poems that proclaim it, sing songs that praise it, and preach sermons that encourage it but until we manifest that love in action, our words are nothing but sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal."
13721,
13722,Silence in the face of evil is evil itself.
13723,Your life as a Christian should make non believers question their disbelief in God.

13725,"Salvation is free, but discipleship will cost you your life"
13726,Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act.
13727,The person who’s in love with their vision of community will destroy community. But the person who loves the people around them will create community everywhere they go.
13728,"Christianity stands or falls with its revolutionary protest against violence, arbitrariness and pride of power and with its plea for the weak. Christians are doing too little to make these points clear rather than too much. Christendom adjusts itself far too easily to the worship of power. Christians should give more offense, shock the world far more, than they are doing now. Christian should take a stronger stand in favor of the weak rather than considering first the possible right of the strong."
13729,"Cheap grace is the grace we bestow on ourselves. Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline, Communion without confession.... Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ, living and incarnate."
13730,"There is nothing that can replace the absence of someone dear to us, and one should not even attempt to do so. One must simply hold out and endure it. At first that sounds very hard, but at the same time it is also a great comfort. For to the extent the emptiness truly remains unfilled one remains connected to the other person through it. It is wrong to say that God fills the emptiness. God in no way fills it but much more leaves it precisely unfilled and thus helps us preserve -- even in pain -- the authentic relationship."
13731,Destruction of the embryo in the mother's womb is a violation of the right to live which God has bestowed upon this nascent life. To raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue. The simple fact is that God certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life. And that is nothing but murder.
13732,"May God in His mercy lead us through these times; but above all, may He lead us to Himself."
13733,The biggest mistake you can make in your life is to be always afraid of making a mistake.
13734,"We are not to simply bandage the wounds of victims beneath the wheels of injustice, we are to drive a spoke into the wheel itself."
13735,"Comfort the troubled, and trouble the comfortable."
13736,"We must be ready to allow ourselves to be interrupted by God, who will thwart our plans and frustrate our ways time and again, even daily, by sending people across our path with their demands and requests. We can, then, pass them by, preoccupied with our important daily tasks, just as the priest-perhaps reading the Bible-passed by the man who had fallen among robbers. When we do that, we pass by the visible sign of the Cross raised in our lives to show us that God’s way, and not our own, is what counts."
13737,The ultimate test of a moral society is the kind of world that it leaves to its children.
13738,"If you board the wrong train, it is no use running along the corridor in the other direction."
13739,"In me there is darkness, But with You there is light; I am lonely, but You do not leave me; I am feeble in heart, but with You there is help; I am restless, but with You there is peace. In me there is bitterness, but with You there is patience; I do not understand Your ways, But You know the way for me.” “Lord Jesus Christ, You were poor And in distress, a captive and forsaken as I am. You know all man’s troubles; You abide with me When all men fail me; You remember and seek me; It is Your will that I should know You And turn to You. Lord, I hear Your call and follow; Help me."
13740,Earthly possessions dazzle our eyes and delude us into thinking that they can provide security and freedom from anxiety. Yet all the time they are the very source of anxiety.
13741,"The deceit, the lie of the Devil consists of this, that he wishes to 
 make man believe that he can live without God's Word."
13742,"Cheap grace is the idea that ""grace"" did it all for me so I do not need to change my lifestyle. The believer who accepts the idea of ""cheap grace"" thinks he can continue to live like the rest of the world. Instead of following Christ in a radical way, the Christian lost in cheap grace thinks he can simply enjoy the consolations of his grace."
13743,We must be ready to allow ourselves to be interrupted by God.
13744,It is only with gratitude that life becomes rich!
13745,The church is not a religious community of worshippers of Christ but is Christ himself who has taken form among people.

13747,A positive attitude and a sense of humor go together like biscuits and gravy.
13748,"Dream more, learn more, care more, and be more."
13749,"I never, ever get involved in politics. With politics you are not allowed to be honest. I don't have time to deal with that. I would rather work with kids."
13750,
13751,"I always just thought if you see somebody without a smile, give'em yours!"
13752,
13753,"We cannot direct the wind, but we can adjust the sails."
13754,"If you're feeling low, don't despair. The sun has a sinking spell every night, but it comes back up every morning."
13755,You'd be surprised how much it costs to look this cheap!
13756,
13757,"Smile, it enhances your face value."
13758,"If you don't like the road you're walking, start paving another one."
13759,"I always had a very open mind and a very open heart. I always look for the good in everybody and the God in everybody. I play to that. And I just love people. I love the difference in people. I love getting to know people. I appreciate getting accepted myself, because I know I'm unusual. And I love the unusual in other people."
13760,Don't get so busy making a living that you forget to make a life.
13761,Storms make trees take deeper roots.
13762,"Understanding isn't learned from punishment and anger. An iron has no gentle touch, and love ain't learned from hate."
13763,"A great smile is a wonderful asset, but a good heart is pure gold."

13774,"Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old only by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up interest wrinkles the soul. Worry, doubt, self-distrust, fear and despair;  these are the long, long years that bow the head and turn the growing spirit back to dust. Whatever your years, there is in every being's heart the love of wonder, the undaunted challenge of events, the unfailing childlike appetite for what next, and the joy and the game of life."
13775,History fails to record a single precedent in which nations subject to moral decay have not passed into political and economic decline. There has been either a spiritual awakening to overcome the moral lapse or a progressive deterioration leading to ultimate national disaster.

13782,"Youth is not entirely a time of life; it is a state of mind. Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. You are as young as your faith, as old as your doubts; as young as your self-confidence, as old as your fear; as young as your hope, as old as your despair."
13783,"For those to whom much is given, much is required. It is not whether you get knocked down, it's whether you get up. There is no substitute for victory."
13784,Preparedness is the key to success and victory.
13785,"By profession I am a soldier and take pride in that fact. But I am prouder - infinitely prouder - to be a father. A soldier destroys in order to build; the father only builds, never destroys. The one has the potentiality of death; the other embodies creation and life. And while the hordes of death are mighty, the battalions of life are mightier still. It is my hope that my son, when I am gone, will remember me not from the battle field but in the home repeating with him our simple daily prayer, Our Father Who Art in Heaven."
13786,"The enemy is in front of us, the enemy is behind us, the enemy is to the right and to the left of us. They can't get away this time!"

13792,We are not retreating - we are advancing in another direction.
13793,"Our government has kept us in a perpetual state of fear - kept us in a continuous stampede of patriotic fervor - with the cry of grave national emergency. Always there has been some terrible evil at home or some monstrous foreign power that was going to gobble us up if we did not blindly rally behind it by furnishing the exorbitant funds demanded. Yet, in retrospect, these disasters seem never to have happened, seem never to have been quite real."
13794,"Believe me, sir, never a night goes by, be I ever so tired, but I read the Word of God before I go to bed."
13795,"The issues which today confront the nation are clearly defined and so fundamental as to directly involve the very survival of the Republic. Are we going to preserve the religious base to our origin, our growth and our progress, or yield to the devious assaults of atheistic or other anti-religious forces? Are we going to maintain our present course toward State Socialism with Communism just beyond or reverse the present trend and regain our hold upon our heritage of liberty and freedom?"

They're the people who matter."

13806,"You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own, and you know what you know. And you are the guy who'll decide where to go."
13807,"A life with love will have some thorns, but a life without love will have no roses. To the world, you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world."
13808,Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.

13852,"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at all in any true sense. Under the clouds of war, it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron."
13853,The supreme quality of leadership is integrity.
13854,"No one should ever sit in this office over 70 years old, and that I know."
13855,"In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together."

13867,"Any time we deny any citizen the full exercise of his constitutional rights, we are weakening our own claim to them."
13868,Should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things. Among them are a few other Texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas. Their number is negligible and they are stupid.
13869,Farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil and you're a thousand miles from the corn field.
13870,"And I should like to assure you, my Islamic friends, that under the American Constitution, under American tradition, and in American hearts, this Center, this place of worship, is just as welcome as could be a similar edifice of any other religion.

This concept is indeed a part of America, and without that concept we would be something else than what we are."
13871,

13876,"I prayed for Faith, and thought that some day Faith would come down and strike me like lightning. But Faith did not seem to come. One day I read in the tenth chapter of Romans, 'Now Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God'. I had closed my Bible, and prayed for Faith. I now opened my Bible, and began to study, and Faith has been growing ever since."
13877,"Out of 100 men, one will read the Bible, the other 99 will read the Christian."

13885,"I firmly believe that the moment our hearts are emptied of pride and selfishness and ambition and self-seeking and every thing that is contrary to God's law, the Holy Ghost will come and fill every corner of our hearts; but if we are full of pride and conceit and ambition and self-seeking and pleasure and the world, there is no room for the Spirit of God; and I believe many a man is praying to God to fill him when he is full already with something else."
13886,God likes His people to believe that there is nothing too hard for Him...We are all the time limiting God's power by our own ideas. Let us get our eyes off one another and fix them upon God. There is nothing to hard for Him.
13887,"In our prayers, we talk to God, in our Bible study, God talks to us, and we had better let God do most of the talking."
13888,Small numbers make no difference to God. There is nothing small if God is in it.
13889,"Happiness is caused by things that happen around me, and circumstances will mar it; but joy flows right on through trouble; joy flows in the night as well as in the day; joy flows through persecution and opposition. It is an unceasing fountain bubbling up in the heart; a secret spring the world can't see and doesn't know anything about."

13894,Some people think God does not like to be troubled with our constant coming and asking. The way to trouble God is not to come at all.
13895,I thought when I became a Christian I had nothing to do but just to lay my oars in the bottom of the boat and float along. But I soon found that I would have to go against the current.
13896,
13897,"We must be willing to let go of the life we have planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us."
13898,You confuse what's important with what's impressive.
13899,Spoon feeding in the long run teaches us nothing but the shape of the spoon.

13901,"One grows accustomed to being praised, or being blamed, or being advised, but it is unusual to be understood."
13902,"Human relations are impossible. When they are real they are uncomfortable, and when they are comfortable they are unreal. It was for the journey into solitude that the human soul was created."
13903,"I am sure that if the mothers of various nations could meet, there would be no more wars."
13904,Books have to be read it is the only way of discovering what they contain.

13908,"We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to place to save things; because the shadow always follows.

13969,"The mind, conditioned as it is by the past, always seeks to re-create what it knows and is familiar with. Even if it is painful, at least it is familiar. The mind always adheres to the known.

13970,"Remember that your perception of the world is a reflection of your state of consciousness. You are not separate from it, and there is no objective world out there. Every moment,

13982,"It's saying, just stop, and be together. Don't talk now, just breathe and feel each other's presence."
13983,"It’s a song about first relationships and letting go. It’s very rare for a relationship to withstand the Earth’s gravitational pull and where it’s going to take people and how they’re going to grow.

13984,I don't want to think I want to feel!
13985,It's an art to live with pain... mix the light into gray.
13986,He who forgets will be destined to remember.
13987,"Music saved me; I mean, my upbringing was like a hurricane, and music was the tree I held onto."
13988,"It's a mystery to me;
We have a greed, with which we have agreed.
You think you have to want more than you need.
Until you have it all, you won't be free."

13993,"Everytime I see the Spice Girls, it makes me want to try to fly by
 climbing my roof and strapping bricks to my shoes."
13994,"I had a long talk with Bruce Springsteen on a rooftop during the Vote for Change tour (in 2004). And it boiled down to this: That guy you used to be, he’s still in the car. He’ll always be in the car. Just don’t let him drive. He might be shouting out directions. But whatever you do, don’t let him get behind the wheel."
13995,"The nice thing about money is that you can do good things with it. I still feel like if something needs to be done or we need to raise money for someone on death row, we can find ways to do it."

14012,The past is a pebble in my shoe.
14013,They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night.

14023,You don't drown by falling in the water; you drown by staying there.
14024,"Knowledge is the acquiring of facts, understanding is the interpreting of facts, wisdom the application."
14025,"Temptation can be tormenting, but remember: The torment of temptation to sin is nothing to compare with the torment of the consequences of sin. Remorse and regret cannot compensate for sin....though sins can be forgiven immediately - the consequences can last a lifetime"
14026,You seek the heights of manhood when you seek the depths of God.
14027,"Winners are not those who never fail, but those who never quit."
14028,Your best friend and worst enemy are both in this room right now. It's not your neighbor right or left - and it's not God or the devil - it's you.

14035,Character is more important than talent.
14036,You cannot compensate by sacrifice what you lose through disobedience
14037,"Boundaries are to protect life, not to limit pleasures."
14038,The difference between men who succeed or fail is their ability to handle pressure.
14039,"The pleasures of sin exist. We cannot deny them. But we also dare not deny what follows in their wake: a voracious appetite, inflamed with eroticism, demanding more indulgence more often until a degenerative spiral captures the soul and drags us on a never ending descent into deeper patterns of immorality and illicit behaviour... Lust goes beyond the sexual. Lust can show itself in a variety of forms: covetousness, gluttony, drunkeness, power hunger, or unbridled ambition, to name a few"
14040,The more you build your life on principle and less on personality - yours or others - the straighter will be your course.

14043,There is a high cost for low living.
14044,The degree of loving is measured by the degree of giving.
14045,All sin is a form of insanity. Satan is the most insane being of all because he still believes he can defeat God
14046,"If you work for a man, in heaven's name work for him, speak well of him, and stand by the institution he represents. Remember, an ounce of loyalty is worth a pound of cleverness. If you must growl, condemn, and eternally find fault - resign your position, and when you are outside, damn to your heart's content - but as long as you are part of the institution, do not condemn it. If you do, the first high wind that comes along will blow you away, and probably you will never know why."
14047,"Dreams can come true, but there is a secret. They're realized through the magic of persistence, determination, commitment, passion, practice, focus and hard work. They happen a step at a time, manifested over years, not weeks."
14048,The greatest mistake you can make in life is continually fearing that you'll make one.
14049,"Many people fail in life, not for lack of ability or brains or even courage but simply because they have never organized their energies around a goal."

14085,Someone once asked me what I regarded as the three most important requirements for happiness. My answer was: A feeling that you have been honest with yourself and those around you; a feeling that you have done the best you could both in your personal life and in your work; and the ability to love others.
14086,"True patriotism springs from a belief in the dignity of the individual, freedom and equality not only for Americans but for all people on earth, universal brotherhood and good will, and a constant and earnest striving toward the principles and ideals on which this country was founded."

14096,
14097,"I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented."
14098,
14099,"Sometimes we must interfere. When human lives are endangered, when human dignity is in jeopardy, national borders and sensitivities become irrelevant. Whenever men or women are persecuted because of their race, religion, or political views, that place must - at that moment - become the center of the universe."
14100,
14101,To remain silent and indifferent is the greatest sin of all.
14102,

Hope turned to dust.
No.
What is man?
Dust turned to hope."
14105,Even in darkness it is possible to create light.
14106,"In order to fly, you have to give up the ground you are standing on."
14107,"I still believe in man in spite of man. I believe in language even though it has been wounded, deformed, and perverted by the enemies of mankind. And I continue to cling to words because it is up to us to transform them into instruments of comprehension rather than contempt. It is up to us to choose whether we wish to use them to curse or to heal, to wound or to console."
14108,"Be careful with words, they're dangerous. Be wary of them. They begat either demons or angels. It's up to you to give life to one or the other. Be careful, I tell you, nothing is as dangerous as giving free rein to words"
14109,"... True, we are often too weak to stop injustices; but the least we can do is to protest against them.  True, we are too poor to eliminate hunger; but in feeding one child, we protest against hunger.  True, we are too timid and powerless to take on all the guards of all the political prisons in the world; but in offering our solidarity to one prisoner we denounce all the tormentors.  True, we are powerless against death; but as long as we help one man, one woman, one child live one hour longer in safety and dignity, we affirm  man's [woman's] right to live."
14110,One person of integrity can make a difference.
14111,"The philosophers are wrong: it is not words that kill, it is silence."

14113,Mankind must remember that peace is not God's gift to his creatures; peace is our gift to each other.
14114,"We are all teachers, or should be. Anyone who relays experience to another person is a teacher. Not to transmit your experience is to betray it."
14115,"Think higher, feel deeper."
14116,"There is much to be done, there is much that can be done... one person of integrity can make a difference."
14117,All collective judgments are wrong. Only racists make them. No human race is superior; no religious faith is inferior.
14118,
14119,"No human being is illegal. That is a contradiction in terms. Human beings can be beautiful or more beautiful, they can be fat or skinny, they can be right or wrong, but illegal? How can a human being be illegal?"
14120,I believe that all the survivors are mad. One time or another their madness will explode. You cannot absorb that much madness and not be influenced by it. That is why the children of survivors are so tragic. I see them in school. They don't know how
14121,
14122,"The way you keep your house, the way you organize your time, the care you take in your personal appearance, the things you spend your money on, all speak loudly about what you believe. The beauty of thy peace shines forth in an ordered life. A disordered life speaks loudly of disorder in the soul."
14123,Fear arises when we imagine that everything depends on us.
14124,Sometimes life is so hard you can only do the next thing.Whatever that is just do the next thing.God will meet you there.
14125,"This hard place in which you perhaps find yourself is the very place in which God is giving you opportunity to look only to Him, to spend time in prayer, and to learn long-suffering, gentleness, meekness - in short, to learn the depths of the love that Christ Himself has poured out on all of us."
14126,A whole lot of what we call 'struggling' is simply delayed obedience.
14127,"The secret is Christ in me, not me in a different set of circumstances."
14128,Today is mine. Tomorrow is none of my business. If I peer anxiously into the fog of the future I will strain my spiritual eyes so that I will not see clearly what is required of me now!
14129,God will not protect you from anything that will make you more like Jesus.
14130,It is always possible to be thankful for what is given rather than to complain about what is not given. One or the other becomes a habit of life.
14131,God never denies us our hearts desire except to give us something better.
14132,"God has promised to supply all our needs. What we don't have now, we don't need now."
14133,"Ordinary work, which is what most of us do, most of the time, is ordained by God every bit as much as is the extraordinary."
14134,The deepest lessons come out of the deepest waters and the hottest fires.
14135,"Faith is not an instinct. It certainly is not a feeling - feelings don't help much when you're in the lions' den or hanging on a wooden Cross. Faith is not inferred from the happy way things work. It is an act of will, a choice, based on the unbreakable Word of a God who cannot lie, and who showed us what love and obedience and sacrifice mean, in the person of Jesus Christ"
14136,"This job has been given to me to do. Therefore, it is a gift. Therefore, it is a privilege. Therefore, it is an offering I may make to God. Therefore, it is to be done gladly, if it is done for Him. Here, not somewhere else, I may learn God’s way. In this job, not in some other, God looks for faithfulness."
14137,Restlessness and impatience change nothing except our peace and joy.
14138,Waiting silently is the hardest thing of all.
14139,We can't really tell how crooked our thinking is until we line it up with the straight edge of Scripture.
14140,"If your goal is purity of heart, be prepared to be thought very odd."
14141,You are loved with an everlasting love. And underneath are the everlasting arms.
14142,"The devil has made it his business to monopolize on three elements: noise, hurry, crowds. He will not allow quietness."
14143,Faith does not eliminate questions. But faith knows where to take them.
14144,"Restlessness and impatience change nothing except our peace and joy. Peace does not dwell in outward things, but in the heart prepared to wait trustfully and quietly on Him who has all things safely in His hands."
14145,"There is nothing worth living for, unless it is worth dying for."
14146,
14147,"The reality is that you will grieve forever. You will not ""get over"" the loss of a loved one; you will learn to live with it. You will heal and you will rebuild yourself around the loss you have suffered. You will be whole again but you will never be the same. Nor should you be the same nor would you want to."
14148,"Grief is real because loss is real. Each grief has its own imprint, as distinctive and as unique as the person we lost. The pain of loss is so intense, so heartbreaking, because in loving we deeply connect with another human being, and grief is the reflection of the connection that has been lost. We think we want to avoid the grief, but really it is the pain of the loss we want to avoid. Grief is the healing process that ultimately brings us comfort in our pain."
14149,"There are only two emotions: love and fear. All positive emotions come from love, all negative emotions from fear. From love flows happiness, contentment, peace, and joy. From fear comes anger, hate, anxiety and guilt. It's true that there are only two primary emotions, love and fear. But it's more accurate to say that there is only love or fear, for we cannot feel these two emotions together, at exactly the same time. They're opposites. If we're in fear, we are not in a place of love. When we're in a place of love, we cannot be in a place of fear."
14150,"People are like stained - glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within."
14151,"Learn to get in touch with the silence within yourself, and know that everything in life has purpose. There are no mistakes, no coincidences, all events are blessings given to us to learn from."
14152,"Real love doesn't die. It's the physical body that dies. Genuine, authentic love has no expectations whatsoever; it doesn't even need the physical presence of a person. ... Even when he is dead and buried that part of you that loves the person will always live."
14153,
14154,"Whether you know it or not, one of the most important relationships in your life is with your Soul. Will you be kind and loving to your Soul, or will you be harsh and difficult? Many of us unknowingly damage our Souls with our negative attitudes and actions or by simple neglect. By making the relationship with your Soul an important part of your life, however, by honoring it in your daily routine, you give your life greater meaning and substance. Use your experiences-all of them-as opportunities to nourish your Soul!"
14155,"When life puts you through a tumbler, it's your choice whether you come out polished or crushed."
14156,"Death is but a transition from this life to another existence where there is no more pain and anguish. All the bitterness and disagreements will vanish, and the only thing that lives forever is love."
14157,"There are dreams of love, life, and adventure in all of us. But we are also sadly filled with reasons why we shouldn't try. These reasons seem to protect us, but in truth they imprison us. They hold life at a distance. Life will be over sooner than we think. If we have bikes to ride and people to love, now is the time."
14158,There is within each one of us a potential for goodness beyond our imagining; for giving which seeks no reward; for listening without judgment; for loving unconditionally.
14159,"It is very important that you only do what you love to do. you may be poor, you may go hungry, you may lose your car, you may have to move into a shabby place to live, but you will totally live. And at the end of your days you will bless your life because you have done what you came here to do. Otherwise, you will live your life as a prostitute, you will do things only for a reason, to please other people, and you will never have lived. and you will not have a pleasant death."
14160,"The opinion which other people have of you is their problem, not yours."
14161,"It is the denial of death that is partially responsible for people living empty, purposeless lives; for when you live as if you'll live forever, it becomes too easy to postpone the things you know that you must do."
14162,"We are living in a time of uncertainty, anxiety, fear, and despair. It is essential that you become aware of the light, power, and strength within each of you, and that you learn to use those inner resources in service of your own and others' growth."
14163,"To love means not to impose your own powers on your fellow man but offer him your help. And if he refuses it, to be proud that he can do it on his own strength."
14164,"You have to temper the iron. Every hardship is an opportunity that you are given, an opportunity to grow. To grow is the sole purpose of existence on this planet Earth. You will not grow if you sit in a beautiful flower garden, but you will grow if you are sick, if you are in pain, if you experience losses, and if you do not put your head in the sand, but take the pain as a gift to you with a very, very specific purpose."
14165,"It's only when we truly know and understand that we have a limited time on earth - and that we have no way of knowing when our time is up, we will then begin to live each day to the fullest, as if it was the only one we had."
14166,"We run after values that, at death, become zero. At the end of your life, nobody asks you how many degrees you have, or how many mansions you built, or how many Rolls Royces you could afford. That's what dying patients teach you."
14167,"We think sometimes we're only drawn to the good, but we're actually drawn to the authentic. We like people who are real more than those who hide their true selves under layers of artificial niceties"
14168,"When we face the worst that can happen in any situation, we grow. When circumstances are at their worst, we can find our best."
14169,"You may not get what you want, but God always gives you what you need."
14170,"There is no need to go to India or anywhere else to find peace. You will find that deep place of silence right in your room, your garden or even your bathtub."
14171,
14172,You're something between a dream and a miracle.
14173,
14174,"Earth's crammed with heaven, And every common bush afire with God: But only he who sees takes off his shoes."
14175,I love you for the part of me that you bring out.
14176,True knowledge comes only through suffering.
14177,How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
14178,Light tomorrow with today!
14179,"Why, what is to live? Not to eat and drink and breathe,—but to feel the life in you down all the fibres of being, passionately and joyfully."

14182,"The little cares that fretted me, I lost them yesterday Among the fields above the sea, Among the winds at play."
14183,What is genius but the power of expressing a new individuality?
14184,Gaze up at the stars knowing that I see the same sky and wish the same sweet dreams.
14185,"Art is much, but love is more."
14186,"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight For the ends of Being and ideal Grace."
14187,What frightens me is that men are content with what is not life at all.
14188,"The essence of all beauty, I call love, The attribute, the evidence, and end, The consummation to the inward sense Of beauty apprehended from without, I still call love."
14189,No man can be called friendless who has God and the companionship of good books.
14190,"Love me sweet With all thou art Feeling, thinking, seeing; Love me in the Lightest part, Love me in full Being."
14191,"If we tried To sink the past beneath our feet, be sure The future would not stand."
14192,"I love thee to the level of everyday's most quiet need, by sun and candle light...I love thee with the breath,smiles,t ears,of all my life."
14193,Much of the possibility of being cheerful comes from the faculty of throwing oneself beyond oneself.
14194,"Whoever lives true life, will love true love."
14195,"A great man leaves clean work behind him, and requires no sweeper up of the chips."
14196,
14197,"What are you willing to give up, in order to become who you really need to be?"
14198,Watch for the people whose eyes light up when you talk about your dream. Those are the people you keep.
14199,"There's always another level up. There's always another ascension. More grace, more light, more generosity, more compassion, more to shed, more to grow."
14200,True power comes from standing in your own truth and walking your own path.
14201,"But if you can plant yourself in stillness long enough, you will, in time, experience the truth that everything (both uncomfortable and lovely) does eventually pass."
14202,"You need to learn how to select your thoughts just the same way you select your clothes every day. This is a power you can cultivate. If you want to control things in your life so bad, work on the mind. That's the only thing you should be trying to control."
14203,"The resting place of the mind is the heart. The only thing the mind hears all day is clanging bells and noise and argument, and all it wants is quietude. The only place the mind will ever find peace is inside the silence of the heart. That's where you need to go."
14204,Tis' better to live your own life imperfectly than to imitate someone else's perfectly.
14205,"If you're brave enough to leave behind everything familiar and comforting, which can be anything from your house to bitter, old resentments, and set out on a truth-seeking journey, either externally or internally, and if you are truly willing to regard everything that happens to you on that journey as a clue and if you accept everyone you meet along the way as a teacher and if you are prepared, most of all, to face and forgive some very difficult realities about yourself, then the truth will not be withheld from you."
14206,The world is like a dropped pie most of the time. Don't kill yourself trying to put it back together. Just grab a fork and eat some of it off the floor. Then carry on.
14207,"The best we can do then, in response to our incomprehensible and dangerous world, is to practice holding equilibrium internally - no matter what insanity is transpiring out there."
14208,the only thing you need to do for now is get some rest and take good care of yourself until you do know the answer
14209,"Creativity itself doesn't care at all about results - the only thing it craves is the process. Learn to love the process and let whatever happens next happen, without fussing too much about it. Work like a monk, or a mule, or some other representative metaphor for diligence. Love the work. Destiny will do what it wants with you, regardless."
14210,Mistakes will be made. Failure will occur. You pick yourself up and carry on.
14211,"Everything good I've ever gotten in life, I only got because I gave something else up."
14212,Being content with what you have already is an art form that leads to a peace that can’t be replaced by anything else.
14213,"You can measure the happiness of a marriage by the number of scars that each partner carries on their tongues, earned from years of biting back angry words."
14214,I crossed the street to walk in the sunshine.
14215,"A true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life."
14216,"There is so much about my fate that I cannot control, but other things do fall under the jurisdiction. I can decide how I spend my time, whom I interact with, whom I share my body and life and money and energy with. I can select what I can read and eat and study. I can choose how I'm going to regard unfortunate circumstances in my life-whether I will see them as curses or opportunities. I can choose my words and the tone of voice in which I speak to others. And most of all, I can choose my thoughts."
14217,Women are capable of enduring a tremendous amount of disappointment and still have a good life.
14218,"Success isn't about acquiring things, it's about discovering your life purpose and following the call"

14227,Do things that make you happy within the confines of the legal system.
14228,It's our challenges and obstacles that give us layers of depth and make us interesting.
14229,"Here are the values that I stand for: honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values."
14230,"Life is about balance. The good and the bad. The highs and the lows. The thing everyone should realize is that the key to happiness is being happy by yourself and for yourself. Happiness comes from within. You have the power to change your own mindset so that all the negative, horrible thoughts that try to invade your psyche are replaced with happy, positive, wonderful thoughts."
14231,Sometimes you can't see yourself clearly until you see yourself through the eyes of others.
14232,
14233,"My grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was sixty. She's ninety-seven now, and we don't know where the hell she is."
14234,Asking who's the 'man' and who's the 'woman' in a same-sex relationship is like asking which chopstick is the fork.
14235,It makes a big difference in your life when you stay positive.
14236,Emote. It's okay. It shows you are thinking and feeling.
14237,"When your heart is broken, when your heart has cracks in it, it lets the light in."
14238,"Laugh. Laugh as much as you can. Laugh until you cry. Cry until you laugh. Keep doing it even if people are passing you on the street saying, ""I can't tell if that person is laughing or crying, but either way they seem crazy, let's walk faster."" Emote. It's okay. It shows you are thinking and feeling."
14239,"Normally, I try not to pay attention to my haters, but this time I'd like to talk about it, because my haters are my motivators."
14240,"Gratitude is looking on the brighter side of the life, even if it means hurting your eyes."
14241,"The definition of success changes. Success is to live your life with integrity and not give in to peer pressure to be something you're not. Follow your passion, stay true to yourself, never follow someone else's path; unless you're in the woods and you're lost and you see a path, then by all means, you should follow that."
14242,Do we have to know who's gay and who's straight? Can't we just love everybody and judge them by the car they drive?
14243,What's New Orleans without music? And what's music without dancing?
14244,Being a teenager and figuring out who you are is hard enough without someone attacking you.
14245,Human beings only use ten percent of their brains. Ten percent! Can you imagine how much we could accomplish if we used the other sixty percent?
14246,
14247,"Don't let anyone tell you what you can or cannot do, or cannot achieve. Do. Not. Allow. It."
14248,
14249,
14250,
14251,
14252,I think our fears find us and force us to confront them over and over again.
14253,
14254,"If not me- who?, If not now- when?"
14255,Young girls are told you have to be the delicate princess. Hermione taught them that you can be the warrior.
14256,Don't feel stupid if you don't like what everyone else pretends to love.
14257,Believe in yourself and go for it
14258,"If you believe in equality, you're a feminist. Sorry to tell you."
14259,There's nothing interesting about looking perfect.
14260,"Becoming yourself is really hard and confusing, and it's a process. It's often not cool to be the person who puts themselves out there."
14261,"I think that it is very important if you know what you want, understand where you are heading towards, and try your best to get it. It is only when we use our hearts to do it, and fall in love with what we are doing, then can we really get real determination."
14262,I don't want the fear of failure to stop me from doing what I really care about.
14263,Girls should never be afraid to be smart
14264,"I truly, truly believe that beauty is something that comes from within."
14265,"We really damage our own confidence when we put ourselves down, so I try not to."
14266,"The difficulty for me is that I'm interested in so many different things. I could never really imagine myself doing one thing, and I'm pretty sure that I'll end up doing four or five different things."
14267,The saddest thing for a girl to do is to dumb herself down for a guy.
14268,"I've found that if ultimately, if you truly pour your heart into what you believe in, even if it makes you vulnerable, amazing things can and will happen."
14269,"If I've learned anything, it's really just to stop trying to find answers and certainties."
14270,I do worry about the expectation to look a certain way.
14271,
14272,Any person capable of angering you becomes your master.
14273,"Happiness and freedom begin with a clear understanding of one principle: Some things are within our control, and some things are not. It is only after you have faced up to this fundamental rule and learned to distinguish between what you can and can't control that inner tranquility and outer effectiveness become possible."
14274,
14275,"When something happens, the only thing in your power is your attitude toward it. It is not the things that disturb us, but our interpretation of their significance. Things and people are not what we wish them to be nor are they what they seem to be. They are what they are."
14276,"It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters."
14277,He who is not happy with little will never be happy with much.
14278,"No matter what happens, it is within my power to turn it to my advantage."
14279,"Be careful whom you associate with. It is human to imitate the habits of those with whom we interact. We inadvertently adopt their interests, their opinions, their values, and their habit of interpreting events."
14280,
14281,Don't be concerned with other people's impressions of you. They are dazzled and deluded by appearances. Stick with your purpose. This alone will strengthen your will and give your life coherence.
14282,"Suffering arises from trying to control what is uncontrollable, or from neglecting what is within our power."
14283,Only the educated are free.
14284,"From this instant on, vow to stop disappointing yourself. Separate yourself from the mob. Decide to be extraordinary and do what you need to do -- now."

14296,
14297,"Dogs come into our lives to teach us about love and loyalty. They depart to teach us about loss. A new dog never replaces an old dog; it merely expands the heart. If you have loved many dogs, your heart is very big."
14298,"Do you want me to tell you something really subversive? Love is everything it's cracked up to be. That's why people are so cynical about it. It really is worth fighting for, being brave for, risking everything for. And the trouble is, if you don't risk anything, you risk even more."
14299,Advice is what we ask for when we already know the answer but wish we didn't.
14300,

14303,"Because I loved myself, I was loved."

14305,"Take your life in your own hands, and what happens? A terrible thing: no one to blame."
14306,"There is a rhythm to the ending of a marriage just like the rhythm of a courtship, only backward."
14307,Home is where your books are.
14308,"As long as I'm facing the right direction, it doesn't matter the size of my steps."
14309,"What I would like to give my daughter is freedom. And this is something that must be given by example, not exhortation. Freedom is a loose leash, license to be different from your mother and still be loved...Freedom is...not insisting that your daughter share your limitations. Freedom also means letting your daughter reject you when she needs to and come back when she needs to. Freedom is unconditional love."
14310,Ambivalence is a wonderful tune to dance to. It has a rhythm all its own.
14311,I have accepted fear as a part of life - specifically the fear of change... I have gone ahead despite the pounding in the heart that says: turn back.
14312,Creativity demands nothing less than all you have. Talent alone is never enough.
14313,The soul is awakened through service.
14314,"I have not ceased being fearful, but I have ceased to let fear control me."
14315,"Always do the things you fear the most. Courage is an acquired taste, like caviar."
14316,I don't think you will ever fully understand how you've touched my life and made me who I am. I don't think you could ever know just how truly special you are that even on the darkest nights you are my brightest star
14317,"The trick is not how much pain you feel--but how much joy you feel. Any idiot can feel pain. Life is full of excuses to feel pain, excuses not to live, excuses, excuses, excuses."
14318,There is no loneliness like the loneliness of a dead marriage.
14319,Gossip is the opiate of the oppressed.
14320,Life has no plot. It is by far more interesting than anything you can say about it.
14321,
14322,The lust for power is not rooted in strength but in weakness.
14323,Only the person who has faith in himself is able to be faithful to others.
14324,"The task we must set for ourselves is not to feel secure, but to be able to tolerate insecurity."
14325,
14326,"The fact that millions of people share the same vices does not make these vices virtues, the fact that they share so many errors does not make the errors to be truths, and the fact that millions of people share the same form of mental pathology does not make these people sane."
14327,"Love isn't something natural. Rather it requires discipline, concentration, patience, faith, and the overcoming of narcissism. It isn't a feeling, it is a practice."
14328,An illusion shared by everyone becomes a reality.
14329,"If other people do not understand our behavior-so what? Their request that we must only do what they understand is an attempt to dictate to us. If this is being 'asocial' or 'irrational' in their eyes, so be it. Mostly they resent our freedom and our courage to be ourselves. We owe nobody an explanation or an accounting, as long as our acts do not hurt or infringe on them."
14330,
14331,
14332,"Many psychiatrists and psychologists refuse to entertain the idea that society as a whole may be lacking in sanity. They hold that the problem of mental health in a society is only that of the number of 'unadjusted' individuals, and not of a possible unadjustment of the culture itself."
14333,"To love somebody is not just a strong feeling - it is a decision, it is a judgment, it is a promise."
14334,"Paradoxically, the ability to be alone is the condition for the ability to love."
14335,The danger of the past was that men became slaves. The danger of the future is that man may become robots.
14336,Hate is a product of the unfulfilled life.
14337,There is no meaning to life except the meaning man gives his life by the unfolding of his powers.
14338,"We are not on the way to greater individualism, but are becoming an increasingly manipulated mass civilization."
14339,"When people can't handle God any more, they turn to religion."
14340,"A society whose principles are acquisition, profit, and property produces a social character oriented around having, and once the dominant pattern is established, nobody wants to be an outsider, or indeed an outcast; in order to avoid this risk everybody adapts to the majority, who have in common only their mutual antagonism."
14341,"The affirmation of one's own life, happiness, growth and freedom, is rooted in one's capacity to love."
14342,"As we ascend the social ladder, viciousness wears a thicker mask."
14343,"The deepest need of the human being is to overcome our
separateness, to leave the prison of our loneliness."
14344,"Happiness does not exclude sadness - if a person responds to life, he's sometimes happy and sometimes sad. What matters is he responds."
14345,"Respect is not fear and awe; it...[is]the ability to see a person as he is, to be aware of his unique individuality. Respect, thus, implies the absence of exploitation. I want the loved person to grow and unfold for his own sake, and in his own ways, and not for the purpose of serving me."
14346,
14347,Life breaks all of us but some of us get stronger in the broken places.
14348,"Before you react, think. Before you spend, earn. Before you criticize, wait. Before you quit, try."
14349,
14350,"The best people possess a feeling for beauty, the courage to take risks, the discipline to tell the truth, the capacity for sacrifice. Ironically, their virtues make them vulnerable; they are often wounded, sometimes destroyed."
14351,"I love you for all that you are, all that you have been, all that you're yet to be."
14352,Critics are men who watch a battle from a high place then come down and shoot the survivors.
14353,"Night is always darker before the dawn and life is the same, the hard times will pass, every thing will get better and sun will shine brighter then ever."
14354,"Try to learn to breathe deeply, really to taste food when you eat, and when you sleep, really to sleep. Try as much as possible to be wholly alive with all your might, and when you laugh, laugh like hell. And when you get angry, get good and angry. Try to be alive. You will be dead soon enough."
14355,The first panacea for a mismanaged nation is inflation of the currency; the second is war. Both bring a temporary prosperity; both bring a permanent ruin. But both are the refuge of political and economic opportunists.
14356,But man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed but not defeated.
14357,"Be fully in the moment,open yourself to the powerful energies dancing around you."
14358,
14359,"The most painful thing is losing yourself in the process of loving someone too much, and forgetting that you are special too."
14360,
14361,"Worry a little bit every day and in a lifetime you will lose a couple of years. If something is wrong, fix it if you can. But train yourself not to worry: Worry never fixes anything."

14369,"Go all the way with it. Do not back off. For once, go all the goddamn way with what matters."
14370,"Any man's life, told truly, is a novel."
14371,
14372,"Feelings are great liars. If Christians worshipped only when they felt like it, there would be precious little worship. We think that if we don’t feel something there can be no authenticity in doing it. But the wisdom of God says something different: that we can act ourselves into a new way of feeling much quicker than we can feel ourselves into a new way of acting. Worship is an act that develops feelings for God, not a feeling for God that is expressed in an act of worship."
14373,"O God, when my faith gets overladen with dust, blow it clean with the wind of your Spirit. When my habits of obedience get stiff and rusty, anoint them with the oil of your Spirit. Restore the enthusiasm of my first love for you."
14374,No life of faith can be lived privately. There must be overflow into the lives of others.
14375,"All the persons of faith I know are sinners, doubters, uneven performers. We are secure not because we are sure of ourselves but because we trust that God is sure of us."
14376,"The word 'christian' means different things to different people. To one person it means a stiff, upright, inflexible way of life, colorless and unbending. To another it means a risky, surprised-filled adventure, lived tiptoe at the edge of expectation...If we get our information from the biblical material, there is no doubt that the Christian life is a dancing, leaping, daring life."
14377,"The only opportunity you will ever have to live by faith is in the circumstances you are provided this very day: this house you live in, this family you find yourself in, this job you have been given, the weather conditions that prevail at the ...moment."
14378,"When we sin and mess up our lives, we find that God doesn't go off and leave us- he enters into our trouble and saves us."
14379,Prayer is the disciplined refusal to act before God acts.
14380,"One way to define spiritual life is getting so tired and fed up with yourself you go on to something better, which is following Jesus."
14381,"If you don't take a Sabbath, something is wrong. You're doing too much, you're being too much in charge. You've got to quit, one day a week, and just watch what God is doing when you're not doing anything."
14382,"Christians don't simply learn or study or use Scripture; we assimilate it, take it into our lives in such a way that it gets metabolized into acts of love, cups of cold water, missions into all the world, healing and evangelism and justice in Jesus' name, hands raised in adoration of the Father, feet washed in company with the Son."
14383,The life of faith is a daily exploration of the constant and countless ways in which Gods grace and love are expereinced
14384,"My job is not to solve people's problems or make them happy, but to help them see the grace operating in their lives."
14385,Wisdom is the art of living skillfully in whatever actual conditions we find ourselves.
14386,"This kingdom of God life is not a matter of waking up each morning with a list of chores or an agenda to be tended to, left on our bedside table by the Holy Spirit for us while we slept. We wake up already immersed in a large story of creation and covenant, of Israel and Jesus, the story of Jesus and the stories that Jesus told. We let ourselves be formed by these formative stories, and especially as we listen to the stories that Jesus tells, get a feel for the way he does it, the way he talks, the way he treats people, the Jesus way."
14387,"There are no experts in the company of Jesus. We are all beginners, necessarily followers, because we don’t know where we are going."
14388,"The way of Jesus cannot be imposed or mapped — it requires an active participation in following Jesus as he leads us through sometimes strange and unfamiliar territory, in circumstances that become clear only in the hesitations and questionings, in the pauses and reflections where we engage in prayerful conversation with one another and with him."
14389,"It is easier to find guides, someone to tell you what to do, than someone to be with you in a discerning, prayerful companionship as you work it out yourself. This is what spiritual direction is."
14390,"Love is not a word that describes my feelings; it is not a technique by which I fulfill my needs; it is not an ideal, abstract and pure, on which I meditate or discourse. It is acting in correspondence with or in response to God in relation to persons."
14391,People are not problems to be solved. They are mysteries to be explored.
14392,"Waiting means going about our assigned tasks, confident that God will provide the meaning and the conclusions."
14393,"Worship is an act that develops feelings for God, not a feeling for God that is expressed in an act of worship."
14394,"Go out into the world uncorrupted, a breath of fresh air in this squalid and polluted society. Provide people with a glimpse of good living and of the living God."
14395,"The hard work of sowing seed in what looks like perfectly empty earth has a time of harvest. All suffering, pain, emptiness, disappointment is seed: sow it in God and He will, finally, bring a crop of joy from it."
14396,
14397,"She was beautiful, but not like those girls in the magazines. She was beautiful, for the way she thought. She was beautiful, for the sparkle in her eyes when she talked about something she loved. She was beautiful, for her ability to make other people smile, even if she was sad. No, she wasn't beautiful for something as temporary as her looks. She was beautiful, deep down to her soul. She is beautiful."
14398,"To be kind is more important than to be right. Many times, what people need is not a brilliant mind that speaks but a special heart that listens."
14399,The world only exists in your eyes. You can make it as big or as small as you want
14400,"I hope you make the best of it. And I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life you're proud of. If you find that you're not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again."
14401,"You are the finest, loveliest, tenderest, and most beautiful person I have ever known—and even that is an understatement."
14402,"And in the end, we were all just humans...Drunk on the idea that love, only love, could heal our brokenness."
14403,Never confuse a single defeat with a final defeat.
14404,Intelligence is measured by a person's ability to see validity within both sides of contradicting arguments.
14405,"Suddenly she realized that what she was regretting was not the lost past but the lost future, not what had not been but what would never be."
14406,"Before you criticize others, remember, they may not have had the same opportunities in life as you have had"
14407,"...the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function. One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise. This philosophy fitted on to my early adult life, when I saw the improbable, the implausible, often the ""impossible,"" come true."
14408,You have a place in my heart no one else ever could have.
14409,"It was only a sunny smile, and little it cost in the giving, but like morning light it scattered the night and made the day worth living."
14410,Never confuse activity with action.
14411,There are all kinds of love in this world but never the same love twice.
14412,"The loneliest moment in someone’s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly."
14413,"Too much of anything is bad, but too much Champagne is just right."
14414,I never blame failure - there are too many complicated situations in life - but I am absolutely merciless toward lack of effort.
14415,Don't forget who you are and where you come from.
14416,Her philosophy is carpe diem for herself and laissez faire for others.
14417,"That is part of the beauty of all literature. You discover that your longings are universal longings, that you're not lonely and isolated from anyone. You belong."
14418,"You are mysterious, I love you. You’re beautiful, intelligent, and virtuous, and that’s the rarest known combination."
14419,I love her and that's the beginning and end of everything.
14420,"Well, you never knew exactly how much space you occupied in people's lives."
14421,
14422,"Success isn’t something that happens overnight: it’s a process. You have to nurture it along with continuous care, and the best way to do this is to have the right people working with you - not for you, but with you. I can dream alone and strive alone, but true success always requires the help and support of others."
14423,Do not let anyone tell you what you can be. Do not let anyone tell you that you are not good enough or smart enough. Remember that nobody is better than you. Everybody puts on their pants one leg at a time.
14424,"Never duck responsibility, its like running from the rain only to fall into the river."
14425,"The more we give, the more we receive. It's important to give back, because the seeds you plant today, you will harvest tomorrow."
14426,"In life we don't get what we want, we get in life what we are. If we want more we have to be able to be more, in order to be more you have to face rejection."
14427,"If you want to find what God put you here to do, ask yourself three questions. First question: What comes easy to you but harder to other people? The second question is: What would you do for years and never have to get paid for it? Third, ask yourself: How can you be of service?"
14428,Money doesn't change who you are; it magnifies who you really are.
14429,Comfort is the enemy of achievement.
14430,Inside every seed is the potential for an incredible harvest.
14431,"We have to learn to face our fears and push ourselves. If you're living on earth and you're not living on the edge, you're taking up too much room. When you push past the fear and realize that what you feared was not a big deal, you gain more confidence."
14432,"If you make too many things too public, then you end up living your life before the court of public opinion."
14433,Always define your area of excellence. Establish the area where you will be the best.
14434,Keep putting out good. It will come back to you tenfold in unexpected ways.
14435,"You know, you don't have to have money to be a successful businessperson. You don't need a college degree. You just need a lot of common sense backed up by a willingness to work hard."
14436,"I believe that my personal mission in life is to grow and contribute, so I am learning and growing every day."
14437,"My grandma used to make syrup for us because we couldn't afford it and I just played around with her recipe. I made strawberry syrup and that didn't really work out but I made strawberry-vanilla and that sold. Then I just went out and took marketing classes, went to seminars, learned about marketing a product and striking deals. It ended up taking orders of $1.5 million."
14438,I firmly believe that the two most important times in a person's life are when they are born and when they find out why they were born.
14439,"Money lets you enjoy the finer things of life, but it doesn't change who you are. It magnifies and brings into fruition the things that you want to hide most. It is a mask for insecurities as well."
14440,"When people listen to people like me, those of us who have a platform, we have to say things that speak truth. We have to empower, inspire, build, and launch the next generation of world solutions that will positively contribute to our economic, political and social fabric and - hopefully - improve the entire nation and the world."
14441,"Sometimes you're pushing and what you want to do is not coming with ease; doors are not opening. A lot of times we're pushing against resistance. If one looks closely, there is often a message in that resistance: ""Wait a minute, maybe it's not what you're supposed to be doing."""
14442,There are so many people living the best life money can buy. I want to slap some of these people. Some of these people you think are living the best life but they're not rich on the inside. I started this philosophy to be spiritual and be rich on the inside out.
14443,"We have to find areas in our lives that we feel most uncomfortable about and want to change. I decided to push myself because it allowed me to give back. I have a scholarship program. When I found out the average age of a homeless person is 9½ years old, I said there must be something that I can do. Now, I am the spokesman for the National Coalition for the Homeless."
14444,American economy is tricky. If you stay in the game you're in a good position for the upswing. If you're not in the game you can't win.
14445,"Money has not changed me. When I look at money, each dollar represents an option of something I could not do yesterday."
14446,
14447,You can be whatever you want to be. Don't let discouragement take you down.
14448,Respect depicts acceptance while disrespect is rejection.
14449,"Look from the blind man's eye.... You can paint the picture, the way you like about this world, so why not think positive and make this world more beautiful for yourself and others?"
14450,
14451,"Without language, thought is a vague, uncharted nebula."
14452,"The ultimate law of language is, dare we say, that nothing can ever reside in a single term. This is a direct consequence of the fact that linguistic signs are unrelated to what they designate and that, therefore, 'a' cannot designate anything without the the aid of 'b' and vice versa, or, in other words, that both have value only by the difference between them."
14453,Time changes all things; there is no reason why language should escape this universal law
14454,"I’m almost never serious, and I’m always too serious. Too deep, too shallow. Too sensitive, too cold hearted. I’m like a collection of paradoxes."
14455,A linguistic system is a series of differences of sound combined with a series of differences of ideas...
14456,"Speech has both an individual and a social side, and we cannot conceive of one without the other."
14457,Language furnishes the best proof that a law accepted by a community is a thing that is tolerated and not a rule to which all freely consent.
14458,"In the lives of individuals and societies, language is a factor of greater importance than any other. For the study of language to remain solely the business of a handful of specialists would be a quite unacceptable state of affairs."
14459,Written forms obscure our view of language. They are not so much a garment as a disguise.
14460,Psychologically our thought-apart from its expression in words-is only a shapeless and indistinct mass.
14461,"Nearly all institutions, it might be said, are based on signs, but these signs do not directly evoke things."
14462,A language presupposes that all the individual users possess the organs.
14463,"Within speech, words are subject to a kind of relation that is independent of the first and based on their linkage: these are syntagmatic relations, of which I have spoken."
14464,"Everyone, left to his own devices, forms an idea about what goes on in language which is very far from the truth."
14465,"Of all social institutions language is least amenable to initiative. It blends with the life of society, and the latter, inert by nature, is a prime conservative force."
14466,"Outside speech, the association that is made in the memory between words having something in common creates different groups, series, families, within which very diverse relations obtain but belonging to a single category: these are associative relations."
14467,"It is useful to the historian, among others, to be able to see the commonest forms of different phenomena, whether phonetic, morphological or other, and how language lives, carries on and changes over time."
14468,"It is only since linguistics has become more aware of its object of study, i.e. perceives the whole extent of it, that it is evident that this science can make a contribution to a range of studies that will be of interest to almost anyone."
14469,"Any psychology of sign systems will be part of social psychology - that is to say, will be exclusively social; it will involve the same psychology as is applicable in the case of languages."
14470,"Henceforth, language studies were no longer directed merely towards correcting grammar."
14471,"It is one of the aims of linguistics to define itself, to recognise what belongs within its domain. In those cases where it relies upon psychology, it will do so indirectly, remaining independent."
14472,"In fact, from then on scholars engaged in a kind of game of comparing different Indo-European languages with one another, and eventually they could not fail to wonder what exactly these connections showed, and how they should be interpreted in concrete terms."
14473,"Linguistics will have to recognise laws operating universally in language, and in a strictly rational manner, separating general phenomena from those restricted to one branch of languages or another."
14474,"The first of these phases is that of grammar, invented by the Greeks and carried on unchanged by the French. It never had any philosophical view of a language as such."
14475,
14476,"Nursing is an art: and if it is to be made an art, it requires an exclusive devotion as hard a preparation as any painter's or sculptor's work; for what is the having to do with dead canvas or dead marble, compared with having to do with the living body, the temple of God's spirit? It is one of the Fine Arts: I had almost said, the finest of Fine Arts."
14477,
14478,Live life when you have it. Life is a splendid gift-there is nothing small about it.
14479,
14480,Nursing is a progressive art such that to stand still is to go backwards.
14481,How very little can be done under the spirit of fear.
14482,
14483,"For us who Nurse, our Nursing is a thing, which, unless in it we are making progress every year, every month, every week, take my word for it we are going back. The more experience we gain, the more progress we can make."
14484,Nature alone cures. ... what nursing has to do ... is to put the patient in the best condition for nature to act upon him.
14485,Never underestimate the healing effects of beauty.
14486,"Live your life while you have it.  Life is a splendid gift.  There is nothing small in it.  For the greatest things grow by God's Law out of the smallest.  But to live your life you must discipline it.  You must not fritter it away in ""fair purpose, erring act, inconstant will"" but make your thoughts, your acts, all work to the same end and that end, not self but God.  That is what we call character."
14487,I think one's feelings waste themselves in words; they ought all to be distilled into actions which bring results.
14488,I am of certain convinced that the greatest heroes are those who do their duty in the daily grind of domestic affairs whilst the world whirls as a maddening dreidel.
14489,"Life is a hard fight, a struggle, a wrestling with the principle of evil, hand to hand, foot to foot. Every inch of the way is disputed. The night is given us to take breath, to pray, to drink deep at the fountain of power. The day, to use the strength which has been given us, to go forth to work with it till the evening."
14490,The very first requirement in a hospital is that it should do the sick no harm.
14491,"If I could give you information of my life it would be to show how a woman of very ordinary ability has been led by God in strange and unaccustomed paths to do in His service what He has done in her. And if I could tell you all, you would see how God has done all, and I nothing. I have worked hard, very hard, that is all; and I have never refused God anything."
14492,"Let whoever is in charge keep this simple question in her head (not, how can I always do this right thing myself, but) how can I provide for this right thing to be always done?"
14493,"The 'kingdom of heaven is within,' indeed, but we must also create one without, because we are intended to act upon our circumstances."
14494,"Jesus Christ raised women above the condition of mere slaves, mere ministers to the passions of the man, raised them by His sympathy, to be Ministers of God."
14495,Starting a job and working hard is how to be successful.
14496,"May we hope that, when we are all dead and gone, leaders will arise who have been personally experienced in the hard, practical work, the difficulties, and the joys of organizing nursing reforms, and who will lead far beyond anything we have done!"
14497,The next Christ will perhaps be a female Christ.
14498,Unnecessary noise is the most cruel abuse of care which can be inflicted on either the sick or the well.
14499,For the sick it is important to have the best.

14504,Everything's a story - You are a story -I am a story.
14505,"How it is that animals understand things I do not know, but it is certain that they do understand. Perhaps there is a language which is not made of words and everything in the world understands it. Perhaps there is a soul hidden in everything and it can always speak, without even making a sound, to another soul."
14506,"At first people refuse to believe that a strange new thing can be done, then they begin to hope it can be done, then they see it can be done--then it is done and all the world wonders why it was not done centuries ago."
14507,Two worst things as can happen to a child is never to have his own way - or always to have it.

14509,"Everything is made out of Magic, leaves and trees, flowers and birds, badgers and foxes and squirrels and people. So it must be all around us. In this garden-in all the places."

14511,"If nature has made you for a giver, your hands are born open, and so is your heart; and though there may be times when your hands are empty, your heart is always full, and you can give things out of that--warm things, kind things, sweet things--help and comfort and laughter--and sometimes gay, kind laughter is the best help of all."
14512,"There's nothing so strong as rage, except what makes you hold it in—that's stronger. It's a good thing not to answer your enemies. I scarcely ever do."

14514,"""It's so beautiful!"" she said, a little breathless with her speed. ""You never saw anything so beautiful! It has come! I thought it had come that other morning, but it was only coming. It is here now! It has come, the Spring!"""

14517,"When I was at school my jography told me th' earth was shaped like a orange an' I found out before I was ten that th' whole orange doesn't belong to nobody. No one owns more than his bit of a quarter an' there's times it seems there's not enow quarters to go around. But don't you-none o' you- think as you own th' whole orange or you'll find out you're mistaken, an' you won't find it without hard knocks. What children learns from children, is that there's no sense grabbin' at th' whole orange-peel an' all. If you do you'll likely not get even th' pips, an' them's too bitter to eat."
14518,"If you fill your mind with a beautiful thought, there will be no room in it for an ugly one. - King Amor"
14519,"Much more surprising things can happen to anyone who, when a disagreeable or discouraged thought comes into his mind, just has the sense to remember in time and push it out by putting in an agreeable, determinedly courageous one. Two things cannot be in one place."
14520,"I am sure there is Magic in everything, only we have not sense enough to get hold of it and make it do things for us"

14522,"Of course there must be lots of Magic in the world,"" he said wisely one day, ""but people don't know what it is like or how to make it. Perhaps the beginning is just to say nice things are going to happen until you make them happen. I am going to try and experiment."
14523,... justice is mercy's highest self.
14524,"In the garden there was nothing which was not quite like themselves - nothing which did not understand the wonderfulness of what was happening to them - the immense, tender, terrible, heart-breaking beauty and solemnity of Eggs. If there had been one person in that garden who had not known through all his or her innermost being that if an Egg were taken away or hurt the whole world would whirl round and crash through space and come to an end... there could have been no happiness even in that golden springtime air."

14552,
14553,"It's crazy, if you think about it. The God of the universe - the creator of nitrogen and pine needles, galaxies and E-minor - loves us with a radical, unconditional, self-sacrificing love. And what is our typical response? We go to church, sing songs, and try not to cuss."
14554,
14555,God's definition of what matters is pretty straightforward. He measures our lives by how we love.
14556,But God doesn't call us to be comfortable. He calls us to trust Him so completely that we are unafraid to put ourselves in situations where we will be in trouble if He doesn't come through.
14557,Don't fall into the trap of studying the Bible without doing what it says.
14558,"In our world, where hundreds of things distract us from God, we have to intentionally and consistently remind ourselves of Him."
14559,Trust whatever He has for you. It will be better than anything you can plan for yourself.
14560,We never grow closer to God when we just live life. It takes deliberate pursuit and attentiveness.
14561,"Lukewarm people give money to charity and to the church...so long as it doesn't impinge on their standard of living. Lukewarm people tend to choose what is popular over what is right. Lukewarm people don't really want to be saved from their sin; they want to be saved from the penalty of their sin. Lukewarm people rarely share their faith with their neighbors, coworkers, or friends. Lukewarm people are thankful for their luxuries and comforts, and rarely consider trying to give as much as possible to the poor."
14562,Grace is when you should be totally punished but are blessed for no reason.
14563,God interrupt whatever we are doing so that we can join You in what You're doing
14564,We need to be more concerned about who we are before God than our reputation before people.
14565,True faith means holding nothing back. It means putting every hope in God's fidelity to His Promises.
14566,"We should be so joyful from God's grace that others would respond by saying, 'I wish I had your God."
14567,The disciples obey because that's what people do when someone rises from the dead and gives instructions.
14568,"When the church really takes on the humble characteristics of Christ, that's going to lead to revival."
14569,Following Christ isn't something that can be done halfheartedly or on the side. It is not a label we can display when it is useful. It must be central to everything we do and are.
14570,I have one reason why you should walk away from that temptation right now. One reason: God. Is. Better.
14571,"‎""Do you know that nothing you do in this life will ever matter, unless it is about loving God and loving the people he has made?"
14572,"A relationship with God simply cannot grow when money, sins, activities, favorite sports teams, addictions, or commitments are piled up on top of it."
14573,"The truth is that the Spirit of the living God is guaranteed to ask you to go somewhere or do something you wouldn't normally want or choose to do. The Spirit will lead you into the way of the cross, as He led Jesus to the cross, and that is definitely not a safe or pretty or comfortable place to be. The Holy Spirit of God will mold you into the person you were made to be."
14574,Having faith often means doing what others see as crazy.

Where there is hatred, let me sow love, 
Where there is injury, pardon; 
Where there is doubt, faith; 
Where there is despair, hope; 
Where there is darkness, light; 
And where there is sadness, joy. 
O Divine Master, 
Grant that I may not so much seek 
To be consoled as to console, 
To be understood as to understand, 
To be loved, as to love."
14578,"Lord, help me to live this day, quietly, easily. To lean upon Thy great strength, trustfully, restfully. To wait for the unfolding of Thy will, patiently, serenely. To meet others, peacefully, joyously. To face tomorrow, confidently, courageously."

14659,"Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the assessment that something else is more important than fear."
14660,"In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happens, you can bet it was planned that way."
14661,Let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an alien power over us. The ultimate rulers of our democracy are not a President and Senators and Congressmen and Government officials but the voters of this country.
14662,The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
14663,True individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.
14664,"Remember, remember always, that all of us, and you and I especially, are descended from immigrants and revolutionists."
14665,Calm seas never made a good sailor
14666,Never underestimate a man who overestimates himself.
14667,"There are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still."
14668,We may make mistakes-but they must never be mistakes which result from faintness of heart or abandonment of moral principle.
14669,Remember you are just an extra in everyone else's play.
14670,"Men are not prisoners of fate, but only prisoners of their own minds."
14671,"We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace - business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering. They had begun to consider the Government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own affairs. We know now that Government by organized money is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob. Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me - and I welcome their hatred."
14672,"I have seen war. I have seen war on land and sea. I have seen blood running from the wounded. I have seen men coughing out their gassed lungs. I have seen the dead in the mud. I have seen cities destroyed. I have seen 200 limping, exhausted men come out of line—the survivors of a regiment of 1,000 that went forward 48 hours before. I have seen children starving. I have seen the agony of mothers and wives. I hate war."
14673,"We may not be able to prepare the future for our children, but we can at least prepare our children for the future."
14674,"Democracy cannot succeed unless those who express their choice are prepared to choose wisely. The real safeguard of democracy, therefore, is education."
14675,
14676,"I no longer know If I wish to drown myself in love, vodka or the sea."
14677,"If you find someone who makes you smile, who checks up on you often to see if you're okay. Who watches out or you and wants the best for you. Who loves and respects you. Don't let them go. People like that are hard to find."
14678,
14679,
14680,
14681,"We live in an age which is so possessed by demons, that soon we shall only be able to do goodness and justice in the deepest secrecy, as if it were a crime."
14682,"Every thing that you love, you will eventually lose, but in the end, love will return in a different form."
14683,Please — consider me a dream.
14684,Anybody who preserves the ability to recognize beauty will never get old.
14685,Do not waste your time looking for an obstacle - maybe there is none.
14686,People label themselves with all sorts of adjectives. I can only pronounce myself as 'nauseatingly miserable beyond repair'.
14687,"I’m doing badly, I’m doing well; whichever you prefer."
14688,"I never wish to be easily defined. I’d rather float over other people’s minds as something strictly fluid and non-perceivable; more like a transparent, paradoxically iridescent creature rather than an actual person."
14689,"I am a cage, in search of a bird."
14690,
14691,I cannot make you understand. I cannot make anyone understand what is happening inside me. I cannot even explain it to myself.
14692,Paths are made by walking
14693,I usually solve problems by letting them devour me.
14694,"I have no memory for things I have learned, nor things I have read, nor things experienced or heard, neither for people nor events; I feel that I have experienced nothing, learned nothing, that I actually know less than the average schoolboy, and that what I do know is superficial, and that every second question is beyond me. I am incapable of thinking deliberately; my thoughts run into a wall. I can grasp the essence of things in isolation, but I am quite incapable of coherent, unbroken thinking. I can't even tell a story properly; in fact, I can scarcely talk."
14695,Nothing is as deceptive as a photograph.
14696,
14697,I do not see the world at all; I invent it.
14698,"If the literature we are reading does not wake us, why then do we read it? A literary work must be an ice-axe to break the sea frozen inside us."
14699,The meaning of life is that it stops.
14700,
14701,There are three ways to ultimate success: The first way is to be kind. The second way is to be kind. The third way is to be kind.
14702,If you could only sense how important you are to the lives of those you meet; how important you can be to the people you may never even dream of. There is something of yourself that you leave at every meeting with another person.
14703,"We live in a world in which we need to share responsibility. It's easy to say ""It's not my child, not my community, not my world, not my problem."" Then there are those who see the need and respond. I consider those people my heroes."
14704,"You make each day a special day. You know how, by just your being you."
14705,"As human beings, our job in life is to help people realize how rare and valuable each one of us really is, that each of us has something that no one else has-or ever will have-something inside that is unique to all time."
14706,"When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, ""Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping."" To this day, especially in times of ""disaster,"" I remember my mother's words and I am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers – so many caring people in this world."
14707,"Some days, doing ""the best we can"" may still fall short of what we would like to be able to do, but life isn't perfect on any front-and doing what we can with what we have is the most we should expect of ourselves or anyone else."
14708,There is something of yourself that you leave at every meeting with another person.
14709,Imagine what our real neighborhoods would be like if each of us offered . . . just one kind word to another person.
14710,"At the center of the Universe is a loving heart that continues to beat and that wants the best for every person. Anything that we can do to help foster the intellect and spirit and emotional growth of our fellow human beings, that is our job. Those of us who have this particular vision must continue against all odds. Life is for service."
14711,Love begins with listening.
14712,"When we love a person, we accept him or her exactly as is: the lovely with the unlovely, the strong with the fearful, the true mixed in with the façade, and of course, the only way we can do it is by accepting ourselves that way."
14713,It always helps to have people we love beside us when we have to do difficult things in life.
14714,"Transitions are almost always signs of growth, but they can bring feelings of loss. To get somewhere new, we may have to leave somewhere else behind."
14715,"Attitudes are caught, not taught."
14716,"Confronting our feelings and giving them appropriate expression always takes strength, not weakness. It takes strength to acknowledge our anger, and sometimes more strength yet to curb the aggressive urges anger may bring and to channel them into nonviolent outlets. It takes strength to face our sadness and to grieve and to let our grief and our anger flow in tears when they need to. It takes strength to talk about our feelings and to reach out for help and comfort when we need it."
14717,Real strength has to do with helping others.
14718,"I believe that appreciation is a holy thing--that when we look for what's best in a person we happen to be with at the moment, we're doing what God does all the time. So in loving and appreciating our neighbor, we're participating in something sacred."
14719,All I know to do is to light the candle that has been given to me.
14720,We speak with more than our mouths. We listen with more than our ears.
14721,A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved.
14722,"The older I get, the more convinced I am that the space between people who are trying their best to understand each other is hallowed ground."
14723,What matters in this life is more than winning for ourselves. What really matters is helping others win too. Even if it means slowing down and changing our course now and then.
14724,"You know, you don't have to look like everybody else to be acceptable and to feel acceptable."
14725,
14726,"Whatever you do with your life-whatever you end up achieving or not achieving-the great gift you have in you to give to the world is the gift of who you alone are; your way of seeing things, and saying things, and feeling about things, that is like nobody else’s. If so much as a single one of you were missing, there would be an empty place at the great feast of life that nobody else in all creation could fill."
14727,"The grace of God means something like: Here is your life. You might never have been, but you are because the party wouldn't have been complete without you. Here is the world. Beautiful and terrible things will happen. Don't be afraid. I am with you. Nothing can ever separate us. It's for you I created the universe. I love you. There's only one catch. Like any other gift, the gift of grace can be yours only if you'll reach out and take it. Maybe being able to reach out and take it is a gift too."
14728,Pay attention to the things that bring a tear to your eye or a lump in your throat because they are signs that the holy is drawing near.
14729,"When you remember me, it means you have carried something of who I am with you, that I have left some mark of who I am on who you are. It means that you can summon me back to your mind even though countless years and miles may stand between us. It means that if we meet again, you will know me. It means that even after I die, you can still see my face and hear my voice and speak to me in your heart."
14730,"One life on this earth is all that we get, whether it is enough or not enough, and the obvious conclusion would seem to be that at the very least we are fools if we do not live it as fully and bravely and beautifully as we can."
14731,"Lord, catch me off guard today. Surprise me with some moment of beauty or pain so that at least for the moment, I may be startled into seeing that you are here in all your splendor, always and everywhere, barely hidden, beneath, beyond, within this life I breathe."
14732,"In the entire history of the universe, let alone in your own history, there has never been another day just like today, and there will never be another just like it again. Today is the point to which all your yesterdays have been leading since the hour of your birth. It is the point from which all your tomorrows will proceed until the hour of your death. If you were aware of how precious today is, you could hardly live through it. Unless you are aware of how precious it is, you can hardly be said to be living at all."
14733,We find by losing. We hold fast by letting go. We become something new by ceasing to be something old.
14734,Your vocation in life is where your greatest joy meets the world's greatest need.
14735,"Jesus is apt to come, into the very midst of life at its most real and inescapable moments. Not in a blaze of unearthly light, not in the midst of a sermon, not in the throes of some kind of religious daydream, but...at supper time, or walking along a road...He never approached from on high, but always in the midst, in the midst of people, in the midst of real life and the questions that real life asks."
14736,"Listen to your life. See it for the fathomless mystery it is. In the boredom and pain of it, no less than in the excitement and gladness: touch, taste, smell your way to the holy and hidden heart of it, because in the last analysis all moments are key moments, and life itself is grace."
14737,Grace is something you can never get but can only be given. There's no way to earn it or deserve it or bring it about anymore than you can deserve the taste of raspberries and cream or earn good looks. A good night's sleep is grace and so are good dreams. Most tears are grace. The smell of rain is grace. Somebody loving you is grace.
14738,"The world says, The more you take, the more you have. Christ says, the more you give, the more you are."
14739,Resurrection means that the worst thing is never the last thing.
14740,"In his holy flirtation with the world, God occasionally drops a handkerchief. These handkerchiefs are called saints."
14741,Don't let your life just go in one eye and out the other.
14742,"If you want to be holy, be kind."
14743,"Of the Seven Deadly Sins, anger is possibly the most fun. To lick your wounds, to smack your lips over grievances long past, to roll over your tongue the prospect of bitter confrontations still to come, to savor to the last toothsome morsel both the pain you are given and the pain you are giving back--in many ways it is a feast fit for a king. The chief drawback is that what you are wolfing down is yourself. The skeleton at the feast is you."
14744,"You can kiss your family and friends good-bye and put miles between you, but at the same time you carry them with you in your heart, your mind, your stomach, because you do not just live in a world but a world lives in you."
14745,"The grace of God means something like: Here is your life. You might never have been, but you are because the party wouldn't have been complete without you."
14746,"Whenever you find tears in your eyes, especially unexpected tears, it is well to pay the closest attention. They are not only telling you something about the secret of who you are but, more often than not, God is speaking to you through them of the mystery of where you have come from and is summoning you to where, if your soul is to be saved, you should go to next."
14747,"Maybe it's all utterly meaningless. Maybe it's all unutterably meaningful. If you want to know which, pay attention to what it means to be truly human in a world that half the time we're in love with and half the time scares the hell out of us. Any fiction that helps us pay attention to that is religious fiction. The unexpected sound of your name on somebody's lips. The good dream. The strange coincidence. The moment that brings tears to your eyes. The person who brings life to your life. Even the smallest events hold the greatest clues."
14748,Your calling is where your own greatest joy intersects with the needs of the world.
14749,"Jesus didn't come to merely speak words that were true, He is the Word that makes us true."
14750,
14751,
14752,
14753,"Liberty is meaningless where the right to utter one's thoughts and opinions has ceased to exist. That, of all rights, is the dread of tyrants. It is the right which they first of all strike down. They know its power. Thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers, founded in injustice and wrong, are sure to tremble, if men are allowed to reason... Equally clear is the right to hear. To suppress free speech is a double wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker."
14754,"If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom, and yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. They want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters. This struggle may be a moral one; or it may be a physical one; or it may be both moral and physical; but it must be a struggle."
14755,"Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe."
14756,"I am a Republican, a black, dyed in the wool Republican, and I never intend to belong to any other party than the party of freedom and progress."
14757,"A man's rights rest in three boxes: the ballot box, the jury box, and the cartridge box."
14758,"Education means emancipation. It means light and liberty. It means the uplifting of the soul of man into the glorious light of truth, the light by which men can only be made free."
14759,"Liberty is meaningless where the right to utter one's thoughts and opinions has ceased to exist. That, of all rights, is the dread of tyrants. It is the right which they first of all strike down."
14760,"A slave is someone who sits down, and waits for someone to free them."
14761,"There is no negro problem. The problem is whether the American people have loyalty enough, honor enough, patriotism enough, to live up to their own constitution"
14762,"I will unite with anyone to do good, but with no one to do harm."
14763,"Once you learn to read, you will be forever free."
14764,"Without a struggle, there can be no progress."
14765,I prayed for twenty years but received no answer until I prayed with my legs.
14766,Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.
14767,Man's greatness consists in his ability to do and the proper application of his powers to things needed to be done.
14768,"I knew that however bad the Republican party was, the Democratic party was much worse. The elements of which the Republican party was composed gave better ground for the ultimate hope of the success of the colored mans cause than those of the Democratic party."
14769,"To make a contented slave it is necessary to make a thoughtless one. It is necessary to darken the moral and mental vision and, as far as possible, to annihilate the power of reason."
14770,Knowledge makes a man unfit to be a slave.
14771,"In a composite Nation like ours, made up of almost every variety of the human family, there should be, as before the Law, no rich, no poor, no high, no low, no black, no white, but one country, one citizenship equal rights and a common destiny for all.
A government that cannot or does not protect the humblest citizen in his right to life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness, should be reformed or overthrown, without delay."
14772,"Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both."
14773,"Educate your sons and daughters, send them to school, and show them that beside the cartridge box, the ballot box, and the jury box, you also have the knowledge box."
14774,Truth is proper and beautiful in all times and in all places.
14775,
14776,
14777,
14778,Passion is the bridge that takes you from pain to change.
14779,"I used to think I was the strangest person in the world but then I thought there are so many people in the world, there must be someone just like me who feels bizarre and flawed in the same ways I do. I would imagine her, and imagine that she must be out there thinking of me too. Well, I hope that if you are out there and read this and know that, yes, it's true I'm here, and I'm just as strange as you."
14780,"I drank to drown my sorrows, but the damned things learned how to swim."
14781,
14782,"Can one invent verbs? I want to tell you one: I sky you, so my wings extend so large to love you without measure."
14783,There is nothing more precious than laughter
14784,I paint flowers so they will not die.
14785,"I wish I could do whatever I liked behind the curtain of “madness”. Then: I’d arrange flowers, all day long, I’d paint; pain, love and tenderness, I would laugh as much as I feel like at the stupidity of others, and they would all say: “Poor thing, she’s crazy!” (Above all I would laugh at my own stupidity.) I would build my world which while I lived, would be in agreement with all the worlds. The day, or the hour, or the minute that I lived would be mine and everyone else’s - my madness would not be an escape from “reality”."
14786,"I am that clumsy human, always loving, loving, loving. And loving. And never leaving."
14787,Take a lover who looks at you like maybe you are a bourbon biscuit.
14788,"Feet, what do I need you for when I have wings to fly?"
14789,I am not sick. I am broken. But I am happy as long as I can paint.
14790,"I wanted to tell you that my whole being opened for you. Since I fell in love with you everything is transformed and is full of beauty... love is like an aroma, like a current, like rain."
14791,"Mankind owns its destiny, and its destiny is the earth. We are destroying it until we have no destiny."
14792,I want a storm to come and flood us into a song that no one wrote.
14793,I think that little by little I'll be able to solve my problems and survive.
14794,"Nothing is worth more than laughter. It is strength to laugh and to abandon oneself, to be light. Tragedy is the most ridiculous thing."
14795,Everyone's opinions about things change over time. Nothing is constant. Everything changes. And to hold onto some dogged idea forever is a little rigid and maybe naive.
14796,"I love you more than my own skin and even though you don’t love me the same way, you love me anyways, don’t you? And if you don’t, I’ll always have the hope that you do, and i’m satisfied with that. Love me a little. I adore you."
14797,"I paint self-portraits because I am so often alone, because I am the person I know best."
14798,"My paintings are well-painted, not nimbly but patiently. My painting contains in it the message of pain. I think that at least a few people are interested in it. It's not revolutionary. Why keep wishing for it to be belligerent? I can't. Painting completed my life. I lost three children and a series of other things that would have fulfilled my horrible life. My painting took the place of all of this. I think work is the best."
14799,What would I do without the absurd and the ephemeral?
14800,
14801,"To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering."
14802,
14803,There will always be rocks in the road ahead of us. They will be stumbling blocks or stepping stones; it all depends on how you use them.
14804,
14805,"I was in darkness, but I took three steps and found myself in paradise. The first step was a good thought, the second, a good word; and the third, a good deed."
14806,
14807,"You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist."
14808,Enjoy life. This is not a dress rehearsal.
14809,"I'm not upset that you lied to me, I'm upset that from now on I can't believe you."
14810,"Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you."
14811,Everything matters. Nothing's important.
14812,I know of no better life purpose than to perish in attempting the great and the impossible.
14813,Our greatest experiences are our quietest moments.
14814,The tree that would grow to heaven must send its roots to hell.
14815,Become who you are. Make what only you can make.
14816,The higher we soar the smaller we appear to those who cannot fly.
14817,Do you want to have an easy life? Then always stay with the herd and lose yourself in the herd.
14818,
14819,All things are subject to interpretation whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth.

14821,"The world is beautiful, but has a disease called man."
14822,you must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame; how could you rise anew if you have not first become ashes?
14823,
14824,"My solitude doesn’t depend on the presence or absence of people; on the contrary, I hate who steals my solitude without, in exchange, offering me true company."
14825,
14826,"America, it is said, is suffering from intolerance - it is not. It is suffering from tolerance. Tolerance of right and wrong, truth and error, virtue and evil, Christ and chaos. Our country is not nearly so overrun with the bigoted as it is overrun with the broadminded."
14827,"The refusal to take sides on great moral issues is itself a decision. It is a silent acquiescence to evil. The Tragedy of our time is that those who still believe in honesty lack fire and conviction, while those who believe in dishonesty are full of passionate conviction."
14828,"Moral principles do not depend on a majority vote. Wrong is wrong, even if everybody is wrong. Right is right, even if nobody is right."
14829,"Prayer begins by talking to God, but it ends by listening to Him. In the face of Absolute Truth, silence is the soul's language."
14830,Civilization is always in danger when those who have never learned to obey are given the right to command.
14831,God does not love us because we are valuable. We are valuable because God loves us.
14832,"When a man loves a woman, he has to become worthy of her. The higher her virtue, the more noble her character, the more devoted she is to truth, justice, goodness, the more a man has to aspire to be worthy of her. The history of civilization could actually be written in terms of the level of its women."
14833,"Freedom does not mean that right to do whatever we please, but rather to do as we ought. The right to do whatever we please reduces freedom to a physical power and forgets that freedom is a moral power."
14834,"If you do not worship God, you worship something, and nine times out of ten it will be yourself. You have a duty to worship God, not because He will be imperfect and unhappy if you do not, but because you will be imperfect and unhappy."
14835,It's impossible to lose your footing when you're on your knees.
14836,"If you do not live what you believe, you will end up believing what you live."
14837,"The humble, simple souls, who are little enough to see the bigness of God in the littleness of a Babe, are therefore the only ones who will ever understand the reason of His visitation. He came to this poor earth of ours to carry on an exchange; to say to us, as only the Good God could say: 'you give me your humanity, and I will give you my Divinity; you give me your time, and I will give you My eternity; you give me your broken heart, and I will give you Love; you give me your nothingness, and I will give you My all."
14838,"There is no word more ""dangerous"" than liberalism, because to oppose it is the new ""unforgivable sin."""
14839,Many souls fail to find God because they want a religion which will remake society without remaking themselves.
14840,"Live each day as you would climb a mountain. An occasional glance toward the summit keeps the goal in mind, but many beautiful scenes are to be observed from each new vantage point. So climb slowly, enjoying each passing moment; and then the view from the summit will serve a more rewarding climax for your journey."
14841,"Today (1950), the hatred of the Moslem countries against the West is becoming hatred against Christianity itself. Although the statesmen have not yet taken it into account, there is still grave danger that the temporal power of Islam may return and, with it, the menace that it may shake off a West which has ceased to be Christian, and affirm itself as a great anti-Christian world Power."
14842,The greatest love story of all time is contained in a tiny white Host.
14843,Sometimes the only way the good Lord can get into some hearts is to break them.
14844,When you are getting kicked from the rear it means you are in front.
14845,"Joy is not the same as pleasure or happiness. A wicked and evil man may have pleasure, while any ordinary mortal is capable of being happy. Pleasure generally comes from things, and always through the senses; happiness comes from humans through fellowship. Joy comes from loving God and neighbor. Pleasure is quick and violent, like a flash of lightning. Joy is steady and abiding, like a fixed star. Pleasure depends on external circumstances, such as money, food, travel, etc. Joy is independent of them, for it comes from a good conscience and love of God."
14846,"Love is the key to the mystery. Love by its very nature is not selfish, but generous. It seeks not its own, but the good of others. The measure of love is not the pleasure it gives-that is the way the world judges it-but the joy and peace it can purchase for others."
14847,"If I were not a Catholic, and were looking for the true Church in the world today, I would look for the one Church which did not get along well with the world; in other words, I would look for the Church which the world hated."
14848,"Our happiest times are those in which we forget ourselves, usually in being kind to someone else. That tiny moment of self-abdication is an act of true humility: the man who loses himself finds himself and finds his happiness."
14849,"Very few people believe in the devil these days, which suits the devil very well. He is always helping to circulate the news of his own death. The essence of God is existence, and He defines Himself as: 'I am Who am.' The essence of the devil is the lie, and he defines himself as: 'I am who am not.' Satan has very little trouble with those who do not believe in him; they are already on his side."
14850,
14851,The best way to keep a prisoner from escaping is to make sure he never knows he's in prison.
14852,"A man who lies to himself, and believes his own lies becomes unable to recognize truth, either in himself or in anyone else, and he ends up losing respect for himself and for others. When he has no respect for anyone, he can no longer love, and, in order to divert himself, having no love in him, he yields to his impulses, indulges in the lowest forms of pleasure, and behaves in the end like an animal. And it all comes from lying - lying to others and to yourself."
14853,
14854,"The darker the night, the brighter the stars, The deeper the grief, the closer is God!"
14855,
14856,
14857,"When I look back on my past and think how much time I wasted on nothing, how much time has been lost in futilities, errors, laziness, incapacity to live; how little I appreciated it, how many times I sinned against my heart and soul-then my heart bleeds. Life is a gift, life is happiness, every minute can be an eternity of happiness."
14858,"If you want to overcome the whole world, overcome yourself."
14859,"Love the animals, love the plants, love everything. If you love everything, you will perceive the divine mystery in things. Once you perceive it, you will begin to comprehend it better every day. And you will come at last to love the whole world with an all-embracing love."
14860,"I gave up caring about anything, and all the problems disappeared."
14861,To be in love is not the same as loving. You can be in love with a woman and still hate her.
14862,A single day is sufficient for a man to discover what happiness is.
14863,Suffering is the sole origin of consciousness.
14864,A hundred suspicions don't make a proof.
14865,The prince says that the world will be saved by beauty! And I maintain that the reason he has such playful ideas is that he is in love.
14866,
14867,"She looked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost always the case with women who retain serenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pure sincere warmth of heart to old age."
14868,"The more you succeed in loving, the more you'll be convinced at the existence of God and the immortality of your soul."
14869,"A man who lies to himself, and believes his own lies, becomes unable to recognize truth, either in himself or in anyone else, and he ends up losing respect for himself and for others."

14873,"But man is so addicted to systems and to abstract conclusions that he is prepared deliberately to distort the truth, to close his eyes and ears, but justify his logic at all cost."
14874,But how could you live and have no story to tell?
14875,
14876,It doesn't have anything to do with how the world perceives you. What matters is what you see.
14877,"Personally, it’s rude. You got three kids with the lady, she just did 17 years for you and you’re not gonna leave your...whatever!"
14878,"People always ask me, 'You have so much confidence. Where did that come from?'. It came from me. One day I decided that I was beautiful, and so I carried out my life as if I was a beautiful girl. I wear colors that I really like, I wear makeup that makes me feel pretty, and it really helps. It doesn't have anything to do with how the world perceives you. What matters is what you see."
14879,"If they hadn’t tried to break me down, I wouldn’t know that I’m unbreakable."
14880,"I am the only consistent person in my life and so I better like myself, and I better love myself. And I really better know that I'm as beautiful as anyone else."
14881,I don't fixate on other people's opinions of my body.
14882,My beauty is dark chocolate and it's delicious and it's sweet.

14884,One day I had to sit down with myself and decide that I loved myself no matter what my body looked like and what other people thought about my body. I got tired of hating myself.
14885,I don't think my brand of self-confidence and self-assuredness can come from an outside source. It's got to come from me.

14887,"I can't quite say that I was raised Muslim, but I remember up until 5 or so I would pray, you know, with my dad. And it's actually a beautiful practice. It's giving of yourself to a higher power - no matter what you call that higher power. Living your life as close to what you think that higher power wants you to be is a really powerful thing."
14888,I don't know any teenager with a positive attitude.
14889,"I hate yoga so much. Like, if yoga was a person, I'd stab them."
14890,I live my life because I dare. I dare to show up when everyone else might hide their faces and hide their bodies in shame.
14891,"Just relax. When I was younger, I made myself the victim of catastrophic thinking. Anything that went wrong was the end of the world. But as I've gotten older, I've learned to stop myself and say, 'Hey babe, calm down. Tomorrow there will be sun.'"
14892,"Most of my life, I wanted to be a therapist, but then I just decided that I didn't want to be in charge of giving people advice. I want to know everything there is to know about psychology. But a therapist? No."
14893,"I certainly used to wish that I was skinny, lighter-skinned, with long, pretty hair. But only because I used to get made fun of for being the absolute opposite. I didn't see all of that stuff as the American Dream. I just wanted to look normal. Now that I'm older, I really do feel like I am a beautiful girl."
14894,"I learned to love myself, because I sleep with myself every night and I wake up with myself every morning, and if I don't like myself, there's no reason to even live the life."
14895,"I think people look at me and don't expect much. Even though, I expect a whole lot."
14896,I was born to stand out. I don't care whether or not people will find me attractive on screen. That's not why I became an actor. I know that more and more with each new role.
14897,"My Plan A was to be a psychologist. I thought I would be a receptionist. I'm always middle of the road and very normal. I've always wanted a normal life, and this is what I got."
14898,"They try to paint the picture that I was this downtrodden, ugly girl who was unpopular in school and in life, and then I got this role and now I’m awesome. But the truth is that I’ve been awesome, and then I got this role."
14899,"I love the way I look. I'm fine with it. And if my body changes, I'll be fine with that."

14904,"If I knew that today would be the last time I’d see you, I would hug you tight and pray the Lord be the keeper of your soul. If I knew that this would be the last time you pass through this door, I’d embrace you, kiss you, and call you back for one more. If I knew that this would be the last time I would hear your voice, I’d take hold of each word to be able to hear it over and over again. If I knew this is the last time I see you, I’d tell you I love you, and would not just assume foolishly you know it already."

14927,"When you ask the Universe to bless you in your effort to align yourself with your soul, you open a passageway between yourself and your guides and Teachers. That is what a blessing is: the opening of a passageway between you and nonphysical guidance."
14928,What is behind your eyes holds more power than what is in front of them.

14931,"Humbleness, forgiveness, clarity and love are the dynamics of freedom. They are the foundations of authentic power."
14932,"The journey to wholeness requires that you look honestly, openly, and with courage into yourself, into the dynamics that lie behind what you feel, what you perceive, what you value, and how you act. It is a journey through your defenses and beyond, so that you can experience consciously the nature of your personality, face what it has produced in your life, and choose to change that. Words lead to deeds. They prepare the soul, make it ready, and move it to tenderness."
14933,You gain or lose power according to the choices that you make.
14934,"There comes a time when the pain of continuing exceeds the pain of stopping. At that moment, a threshold is crossed. What seemed unthinkable becomes thinkable. Slowly, the realization emerges that the choice to continue what you have been doing is the choice to live in discomfort, and the choice to stop what you have been doing is the choice to breathe deeply and freely again. Once that realization has emerged, you can either honor it or ignore it, but you cannot forget it. What has become known can not become unknown again."

14942,"If we perceived life with reverence, we would stand in awe at the experience of physical life and walk the earth in a very deep sense of gratitude."

Each offers you an opportunity to see beyond the illusion that serves as the balancing and growth of your soul."

14946,Most people use their energy attempting to rearrange circumstances that trigger painful emotions. Changing external circumstances will not change your rigid patterns of emotional response. That requires looking at the patterns themselves.

14948,"Your emotional reactions to the evil you encounter and your judgments of it show you what you need to change in yourself. Changing those parts of your personality that judge, react in fear, and cannot love into acceptance, fearlessness, and love is the journey you were born to make."
14949,"You cannot, and will not, encounter
a circumstance, or a single moment,
that does not serve directly and immediately 
the need of your soul to heal."
14950,
14951,Happiness is different from pleasure. Happiness has something to do with struggling and enduring and accomplishing.
14952,"There are as many reasons for running as there are days in the year, years in my life. But mostly I run because I am an animal and a child, an artist and a saint. So, too, are you. Find your own play, your own self-renewing compulsion, and you will become the person you are meant to be."

14956,"Everyone is an athlete. The only difference is that some of us are in training, and some are not."
14957,"The more I run, the more I want to run, and the more I live a life conditioned and influenced and fashioned by my running. And the more I run, the more certain I am that I am heading for my real goal: to become the person I am."
14958,"Running is just such a monastery- a retreat, a place to commune with God and yourself, a place for psychological and spiritual renewal."

14960,"There are those of us who are always about to live.

14961,"Success rests with having the courage and endurance and, above all, the will to become the person you are, however peculiar that may be. Then you will be able to say, I found my hero and he is me."
14962,"If you want to find the answers to the Big Questions about your soul, you'd best begin with the Little Answers about your body."
14963,"No matter how old I get, the race remains one of life's most rewarding experiences. My times become slower and slower, but the experience of the race is unchanged: each race a drama, each race a challenge, each race stretching me in one way or another, and each race telling me more about myself and others."
14964,"Sport is where an entire life can be compressed into a few hours, where the emotions of a lifetime can be felt on an acre or two of ground, where a person can suffer and die and rise again on six miles of trails through a New York City park. Sport is a theater where sinner can turn saint and a common man become an uncommon hero, where the past and the future can fuse with the present. Sport is singularly able to give us peak experiences where we feel completely one with the world and transcend all conflicts as we finally become our own potential."
14965,"Once you have decided that winning isn't everything, you become a winner."
14966,"The study of motivation goes back to the Greeks.  Their sports were essential to their education.  They saw in sports the integration of body, mind and soul, the creation of beauty, the mastering of athletics, and the challenge of competition.  A French sociologist points this out.  ""Sports,"" he wrote, was part of the education of the citizen.  He was expected to engage in exercise for a whole series of reasons that had to do with the shaping of the citizen; the relation between moral good and physical good; and the growth of a person."

14968,Listen to your body. Do not be a blind and deaf tenant.
14969,Some think guts is sprinting at the end of a race. But guts is what got you there to begin with. Guts start back in the hills with 6 miles to go and you're thinking of how you can get out of this race without anyone noticing. Guts begin when you still have forty minutes of torture left and you're already hurting more than you ever remember.
14970,I will not last forever. But I am damn well going to know I have been here.
14971,"I have a bumper sticker that Bowen created that says Regardless of my kids grades, they have an 'A' in my book'. Without play the child that still lives in all of us will always be incomplete. And not only physically, but creatively, intellectually, and spiritually as well."
14972,"Life is the greatest experiment. Each of us is an experiment of one-observer and subject-making choices, living with them, recording the effects."
14973,Out on the roads there is fitness and self-discovery and the persons we were destined to be.
14974,The difference between a jogger and a runner is an entry blank.
14975,
14976,"This is the true joy in life: Being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one, being a force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy. I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it what I can. It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for the moment and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations."

15000,"Governments don't want a population capable of critical thinking, they want obedient workers, people just smart enough to run the machines and just dumb enough to passively accept their situation.You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own, and control the corporations. They've long since bought, and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear."
15001,"Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that."
15002,
15003,"Keep in mind, the news media are not independent; they are a sort of bulletin board and public relations firm for the ruling class-the people who run things. Those who decide what news you will or will not hear are paid by, and tolerated purely at the whim of, those who hold economic power. If the parent corporation doesn't want you to know something, it won't be on the news. Period. Or, at the very least, it will be slanted to suit them, and then rarely followed up."
15004,"There is nothing wrong with the planet. The planet is fine ... been here 4 1/2 billion years. We've been here, what, a 100,000 years, maybe 200,000. And we've only been engaged in heavy industry a little over 200 years. 200 years versus 4 1/2 billion. And we have the conceit to think that somehow we're a threat? The planet isn't going away. We are."

15006,Don’t just teach your children to read… Teach them to question what they read. Teach them to question everything.
15007,"The real reason that we can’t have the Ten Commandments in a courthouse: You cannot post “Thou shalt not steal,” “Thou shalt not commit adultery,” and “Thou shalt not lie” in a building full of lawyers, judges, and politicians. It creates a hostile work environment."

 cancer, the war on drugs. But did you ever notice that we have no war on homelessness? You know why? Because there's no money in that problem. No money to be made off of the homeless. If you can find a solution to homelessness where the corporations and politicians can make a few million dollars each, you will see the streets of America begin to clear up pretty damn quick!"
15024,"There is a planet named Pluto, but we don't have one named Goofy. Goofy would be a good name for this planet. It certainly qualifies."

You can always make a change for the better no matter what background you derived from. You can always do your best and be all that you can be because you will always be uniquely you. It is why it is always wise to listen to your eternal heart, your eternal instincts, and what it had always strove for and/or to do because really anybody can make a difference not only in their own lives but in the lives of others. It is never too late to shine; never."

15287,"If Colleen Howe had been a hockey player, she would have been a centremen. I can see her as a centreman because you can do what you want and go wherever you want to go."
15288,Overall I can fairly safely say Bobby Orr impressed me more than anybody with his tremendous talents. In Bobby's first N.H.L. game he layed the lumber to Gordie's head. Later Howe retalliated and wanted to let the kid know he wasn't washed up yet.
15289,The kid looks good in his first game.

If we will put our trust in Him, if we will pray to Him, if we will live worthy of His blessings, He will hear our prayers."

Just do the best you can, but be sure it is the very best."

15307,I am satisfied that happiness in marriage is not so much a matter of romance as it is an anxious concern for the comfort and well-being of one's companion.

15356,"In spite of how things may appear to us, we are never trapped by where we are. The trap is always who we are"
15357,Discouragement is a negative emotion with more than one trick up its dark sleeve.  It tricks you into mentally or emotionally dwelling in the very place you want to leave.

They have, taking one with another, no special talent for the business of government; they have only a talent for getting and holding office. Their principal device to that end is to search out groups who pant and pine for something they can't get and to promise to give it to them. Nine times out of ten that promise is worth nothing. The tenth time is made good by looting A to satisfy B. In other words, government is a broker in pillage, and every election is sort of an advance auction sale of stolen goods."

15499,The place between your comfort zone and your dream is where life takes place.
15500,"The struggle of life is one of our greatest blessings. It makes us patient, sensitive, and Godlike. It teaches us that although the world is full of suffering, it is also full of the overcoming of it."
15501,"I am only one,
But still I am one. 
I cannot do everything, 
But still I can do something; 
And because I cannot do everything, 
I will not refuse to do the something that I can do."
15502,"Hope sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves the impossible."
15503,The best educated human being is the one who understands most about the life in which he is placed.
15504,A bend in the road is not the end of the road…Unless you fail to make the turn.
15505,
15506,We are never really happy until we try to brighten the lives of others.
15507,
15508,A well-educated mind will always have more questions than answers.
15509,Making a mistake is falling down; failure is not getting up again.
15510,"Better to be blind and see with your heart, than to have two good eyes and see nothing."
15511,"Even if you have a problem, you don't need to be one."
15512,What we have once enjoyed we can never lose. All that we love deeply becomes a part of us.
15513,"I long to accomplish a great and noble task, but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble."
15514,"God doesn't promise security from life's storms but security in life's storms. God doesn't always call the equipped, but he will always equip the called. In the long run, avoiding danger is no safer than outright exposure. The fearful are caught as often as the bold."
15515,
15516,"I believe there are angels among us, sent down to us from somewhere up above. They come to you and me in our darkest hours, to show us how to live, to teach us how to give, to guide us with a light of love."
15517,"Time is not measured by the years that you live But by the deeds that you do and the joy that you give- And each day as it comes brings a chance to each one To love to the fullest, leaving nothing undone That would brighten the life or lighten the load Of some weary traveler lost on Life's Road- So what does it matter how long we may live If as long as we live we unselfishly give."
15518,"May tender memories soften your grief, May fond recollection bring you relief, And may you find comfort and peace in the thought Of the joy that knowing your loved one brought... For time and space can never divide Or keep your loved one from your side. When memory paints in colors true, the happy hours that belonged to you."
15519,"God, teach me to be patient, teach me to go slow, Teach me how to wait on You when my way I do not know. Teach me sweet forbearance when things do not go right So I remain unruffled when others grow uptight. Teach me how to quiet my racing, rising heart So I might hear the answer You are trying to impart. Teach me to let go, dear God, and pray undisturbed until My heart is filled with inner peace and I learn to know your will."
15520,"After the clouds, the sunshine; after the winter, the spring; after the shower, the rainbow; for life is a changeable thing. After the night, the morning, bidding all darkness cease, after life's cares and sorrows, the comfort and sweetness of peace."
15521,"A Mother's love is something   that no one can explain,   It is made of deep devotion   and of sacrifice and pain,   It is endless and unselfish   and enduring come what may   For nothing can destroy it   or take that love away"
15522,Grief is a solitary journey. No one but you knows how great the hurt is. No one but you can know the gaping hole left in your life when someone you know has died. And no one but you can mourn the silence that was once filled with laughter and song. It is the nature of love and of death to touch every person in a totally unique way. Comfort comes from knowing that people have made the same journey. And solace comes from understanding how others have learned to sing again.
15523,"Love is like magic and it always will be. For love still remains life's sweet mystery! Love works in ways that are wondrous and strange and there's nothing in life that love cannot change! Love can transform the most commonplace into beauty and splendor and sweetness and grace. Love is unselfish, understanding and kind, for it sees with its heart and not with its mind! Love is the answer that everyone seeks... Love is the language, that every heart speaks. Love can't be bought, it is priceless and free, love, like pure magic, is life's sweet mystery!"
15524,"In this troubled world, it's refreshing to find someone who still has the time to be kind. Someone who still has the faith to believe that the more you give, the more you receive. Someone who's ready by thought, word, or deed to reach out a hand, in the hour of need."
15525,"You cannot change reality, but you can control the manner in which you look at things. Your attitude is under your own control. Weed out the negative and focus on the positive!"
15526,"God grant me courage and hope for everyday, faith to guide me along my way, understanding and wisdom, too, and grace to accept what life gives me to do."
15527,No matter how steep the mountain - the Lord is going to climb it with you.
15528,"When you ask God for a gift, Be thankful if he sends, Not diamonds, pearls or riches, but the love of real true friends."
15529,"When you are in troubled and worried and sick at heart And your plans are upset and your world falls apart, Remember God's ready and waiting to share The burden you find much to heavy to bear-- So with faith, ""Let Go and Let GOD"" lead your way Into a brighter and less troubled day"
15530,"The way to real growth is not to become more powerful or more famous, but to become more human and more tolerant."
15531,"A mother's love is like a beacon, Burning bright with Faith and Prayer, And through the changing scenes of life, We can find a haven there."
15532,"In everything both great and small, We see the Hand of God in all."
15533,Never borrow sorrow from tomorrow.
15534,"A mother's love is something that no one can explain — It is made of deep devotion and of sacrifice and pain. It is endless and unselfish and enduring, come what may, For nothing can destroy it or take that love away. It is patient and forgiving when all others are forsaking, And it never fails or falters even though the heart is breaking."
15535,Comfort comes from knowing that people have made the same journey. And solace comes from understanding how others have learned to sing again.
15536,"ADVERSITY CAN DISTRESS US OR BLESS US The way we use adversity is strictly our own choice, For in God's Hands adversity can make the heart rejoice - For everything God sends to us, no matter in what form, Is sent with plan and purpose for by the fierceness of a storm The atmosphere is changed and cleared and the earth is washed and clean."
15537,"Stop wishing for things you complain you have not, and start making the best of all that you've got."
15538,"A wee bit of heaven drifted down from above, a handful of happiness, a heart full of love."
15539,"For each time you smile you will find it's true somebody, somewhere, will smile back at you."
15540,Love changes darkness into light and makes the heart take a wingless flight.
15541,"It takes a Mother’s Love to make a house a home, a place to be remembered, no matter where we roam."
15542,
15543,"Nobody escapes being wounded. We are all wounded people, whether physically, emotionally, mentally, or spiritually. The main question is not, 'How can we hide our wounds?' so we don't have to be embarrassed, but 'How can we put our woundedness in the service of others?' When our wounds cease to be a source of shame, and become a source of healing, we have become wounded healers."
15544,"Compassion asks us to go where it hurts, to enter into the places of pain, to share in brokenness, fear, confusion, and anguish. Compassion challenges us to cry out with those in misery, to mourn with those who are lonely, to weep with those in tears. Compassion requires us to be weak with the weak, vulnerable with the vulnerable, and powerless with the powerless. Compassion means full immersion in the condition of being human."
15545,"Did I offer peace today? Did I bring a smile to someone's face? Did I say words of healing? Did I let go of my anger and resentment? Did I forgive? Did I love?' These are the real questions. I must trust that the little bit of love that I sow now will be many fruits, here in this world and the life to come."
15546,
15547,"When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives mean the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand. The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing, not curing, not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that is a friend who cares."
15548,"Joy does not simply happen to us. We have to choose joy and keep choosing it every day. It is a choice based on the knowledge that we belong to God and have found in God our refuge and our safety and that nothing, not even death, can take God away from us."
15549,"This is what life is about. It is being sent on a trip by a loving God, who is waiting at home for our return and is eager to watch the slides we took and hear about the friends we made. When we travel with the eyes and ears of the God who sent us, we will see wonderful sights, hear wonderful sounds, meet wonderful people ... and be happy to return home."
15550,Hope is willing to leave unanswered questions unanswered and unknown futures unknown. Hope makes you see God's guiding hand not only in the gentle and pleasant moments but also in the shadows of disappointment and darkness.
15551,"What makes us human is not our mind but our heart, not our ability to think but our ability to love."
15552,"It is in solitude that we discover that being is more important than having and that we are worth more than the results of our efforts. 
 In solitude we discover that our life is not a possession to be defended but a gift to be shared."
15553,"Friendship is one of the greatest gifts a human being can receive. It is a bond beyond common goals, common interests, or common histories. It is a bond stronger than sexual union can create, deeper than a shared fate can solidify, and even more intimate than the bonds of marriage or community. Friendship is being with the other in joy and sorrow, even when we cannot increase the joy or decrease the sorrow. It is a unity of souls that gives nobility and sincerity to love. Friendship makes all of life shine brightly."
15554,Waiting time is not wasting time. Waiting patiently in expectation is the foundation of the spiritual life.
15555,"In a world so torn apart by rivalry, anger, and hatred, we have the privileged vocation to be living signs of a love that can bridge all divisions and heal all wounds."
15556,Forgiveness changes the way we remember. It converts the curse into a blessing. Forgiveness indeed heals memories . . .
15557,You don't think your way into a new kind of living. You live your way into a new kind of thinking.
15558,"But what I would like to say is that the spiritual life is a life in which you gradually learn to listen to a voice that says something else, that says, ""You are the beloved and on you my favour rests.""... I want you to hear that voice. It is not a very loud voice because it is an intimate voice. It comes from a very deep place. It is soft and gentle. I want you to gradually hear that voice. We both have to hear that voice and to claim for ourselves that that voice speaks the truth, our truth. It tells us who we are."
15559,"Those we most love cause us not only great joy but also great pain. LOVE is stronger than fear, life stronger than death, hope stronger than despair. We have to trust that the risk of loving is always worth taking."
15560,"Spiritual maturity is not knowing what to do with your whole life, but just knowing what to do next."
15561,"We are called to be fruitful - not successful, not productive, not accomplished. Success comes from strength, stress, and human effort. Fruitfulness comes from vulnerability and the admission of our own weakness."
15562,"If you feel loved, you can do a thousand things. If you feel rejected, everything becomes a problem."
15563,Dare to love and to be a real friend. The love you give and receive is a reality that will lead you closer and closer to God as well as those whom God has given you to love.
15564,The only feelings that do not heal are the ones you hide.
15565,Self-rejection is the greatest enemy of the spiritual life because it contradicts the sacred voice that calls us the Beloved.
15566,Our life is...a time in which sadness and joy kiss each other at every moment.
15567,
15568,"Simplify your life. Don't waste the years struggling for things that are unimportant. Don't burden yourself with possessions. Keep your needs and wants simple and enjoy what you have. Don't destroy your peace of mind by looking back, worrying about the past. Live in the present. Simplify!"
15569,"Think for yourself, or others will think for you without thinking of you."
15570,
15571,"What the essential difference between man and woman is, that they should be thus attracted to one another, no one has satisfactorily answered. Perhaps we must acknowledge the justness of the distinction which assigns to man the sphere of wisdom, and to woman that of love, though neither belongs exclusively to either. Man is continually saying to woman, Why will you not be more wise? Woman is continually saying to man, Why will you not be more loving? It is not in their wills to be wise or to be loving; but, unless each is both wise and loving, there can be neither wisdom nor love."
15572,Life isn't about finding yourself; it's about creating yourself. So live the life you imagined.
15573,
15574,Every oak tree started out as a couple of nuts who stood their ground.
15575,"As a single footstep will not make a path on the earth, so a single thought will not make a pathway in the mind. To make a deep physical path, we walk again and again. To make a deep mental path, we must think over and over the kind of thoughts we wish to dominate our lives."
15576,The little things in life are as interesting as the big ones.
15577,The only people who ever get anyplace interesting are the people who get lost.

15583,Do not engage to find things as you think they are.
15584,"Do not lose hold of your dreams or aspirations. For if you do, you may still exist but you have ceased to live."
15585,"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived."
15586,"If the machine of government is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then, I say, break the law."

15607,The two most important things in any company do not appear in its balance sheet: its reputation and its people.
15608,
15609,
15610,"Don't find fault, find a remedy."
15611,It is failure that is easy. Success is always hard.
15612,"Three rules: I do not eat too much; I do not worry too much; and, if I do my best, I believe that what happens, happens for the best."
15613,"If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own."
15614,It's your thinking that decides whether you're going to succeed or fail.
15615,"The competitor to be feared is one who never bothers about you at all, but goes on making his own business better all the time."
15616,To do more for the world than the world does for you - that is success.
15617,
15618,
15619,"Life moves on, whether we act as cowards or heroes. Life has no other discipline to impose, if we would but realize it, than to accept life unquestioningly. Everything we shut our eyes to, everything we run away from, everything we deny, denigrate or despise, serves to defeat us in the end. What seems nasty, painful, evil, can become a source of beauty, joy, and strength, if faced with an open mind. Every moment is a golden one for him who has the vision to recognize it as such"
15620,"To be silent the whole day long, see no newspaper, hear no radio, listen to no gossip, be thoroughly and completely lazy, thoroughly and completely indifferent to the fate of the world is the finest medicine a man can give himself."
15621,"The aim of life is to live, and to live means to be aware, joyously, drunkenly, serenely, divinely aware."
15622,"It is with the soul that we grasp the essence of another human being, not with the mind, nor even with the heart."
15623,"Real love is never perplexed, never qualifies, never rejects, never demands. It replenishes, by grace of restoring unlimited circulation. It burns, because it knows the true meaning of sacrifice. It is life illuminated."
15624,"The moment one gives close attention to any thing, even a blade of grass it becomes a mysterious, awesome, indescribably magnificent world in itself."
15625,There's nothing wrong with the world. What's wrong is our way of looking at it.
15626,Destiny is what you are supposed to do in life. Fate is what kicks you in the ass to make you do it.
15627,...the wise man knows that every experience is to be viewed as a blessing.
15628,"To make living itself an art, that is the goal."
15629,Music is the can-opener of the soul.

He who knows and knows not that he knows. He is asleep; wake him.
He who knows not and knows not that he knows not. He is a fool; shun him.
He who knows not and knows that he knows not. He is a child; teach him.
He who knows and knows that he knows. He is a king; follow him.

15673,"The difference between perseverance and obstinacy is that one comes from a strong will, and the other from a strong won't."
15674,We should not judge people by their peak of excellence; but by the distance they have traveled from the point where they started.
15675,Every tomorrow has two handles. We can take hold of it with the handle of anxiety or the handle of faith.
15676,Hold yourself responsible for a higher standard than anybody expects of you. Never excuse yourself.
15677,"No man can tell if he is rich or poor by turning to his ledger. It is the heart that makes a man rich. He is rich according to what he is, not according to what he has."
15678,"A house built on sand is, in fair weather, just as good as if builded on a rock. A cobweb is as good as the mightiest chain cable when there is no strain on it. It is trial that proves one thing weak and another strong."
15679,A person without a sense of humor is like a wagon without springs. It's jolted by every pebble on the road.
15680,It's easier to go down a hill than up it but the view is much better at the top.

15703,"I have no right to call myself one who knows. I was one who seeks, and I still am, but I no longer seek in the stars or in books; I'm beginning to hear the teachings of my blood pulsing within me.

15704,Learn what is to be taken seriously and laugh at the rest.
15705,Theory is knowledge that doesn't work. Practice is when everything works and you don't know why.

15743,The greatest medicine of all is teaching people how not to need it
15744,
15745,"Everyone has a doctor in him or her; we just have to help it in its work. The natural healing force within each one of us is the greatest force in getting well. Our food should be our medicine. Our medicine should be our food. But to eat when you are sick, is to feed your sickness."
15746,
15747,Our food should be our medicine and our medicine should be our food.

15755,The natural force within each of us is that greatest healer of all.
15756,
15757,"Positive health requires a knowledge of man's primary constitution and of the powers of various foods, both those natural to them and those resulting from human skill. But eating alone is not enough for health. There must also be exercise, of which the effects must likewise be known. The combination of these two things makes regimen, when proper attention is given to the season of the year, the changes of the wind, the age of the individual, and the situation of his home. If there is any deficiency in food or exercise, the body will fall sick."

15817,"Civil disobedience is not our problem. Our problem is civil obedience. Our problem is that people all over the world have obeyed the dictates of leaders…and millions have been killed because of this obedience…Our problem is that people are obedient allover the world in the face of poverty and starvation and stupidity, and war, and cruelty. Our problem is that people are obedient while the jails are full of petty thieves… (and) the grand thieves are running the country. That’s our problem."
15818,
15819,"To be hopeful in bad times is based on the fact that human history is not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness. If we see only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something. If we remember those times and places where people have behaved magnificently, this gives us the energy to act. And if we do act, in however small a way, we don't have to wait for some grand Utopian future. The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory."
15820,"They have the guns, we have the poets. Therefore, we will win."
15821,
15822,"Historically, the most terrible things - war, genocide, and slavery - have resulted not from disobedience, but from obedience."
15823,"If patriotism were defined, not as blind obedience to government, not as submissive worship to flags and anthems, but rather as love of one's country, one's fellow citizens (all over the world), as loyalty to the principles of justice and democracy, then patriotism would require us to disobey our government, when it violated those principles."
15824,
15825,"Small acts, when multiplied by millions of people, can transform the world."
15826,"When I say history is a matter of life and death, I mean this: If you really don't know history, you are a victim of whatever the authorities tell you. You have no way of checking up on them. You have no way of deciding whether there is any truth in what they are saying."
15827,"I am convinced that imprisonment is a way of pretending to solve the problem of crime. It does nothing for the victims of crime, but perpetuates the idea of retribution, thus maintaining the endless cycle of violence in our culture. It is a cruel and useless substitute for the elimination of those conditions--poverty, unemployment, homelessness, desperation, racism, greed--which are at the root of most punished crime. The crimes of the rich and powerful go mostly unpunished."

15829,"I am not an absolute pacifist, because I can't rule out the possibility that under some, carefully defined circumstances, some degree of violence may be justified, if it is focused directly at a great evil."
15830,"Democracy depends on citizens being informed, and since our media, especially television (which is the most important source of news for most Americans) reports mostly what the people in power do, and repeats what the people in power say, the public is badly informed, and it means we cannot really say we have a functioning democracy."
15831,War is terrorism ... Terrorism is the willingness to kill large numbers of people for some presumably good cause. That's what terrorists are about.

15833,
15834,"Behind the deceptive words designed to entice people into supporting violence -- words like democracy, freedom, self-defense, national security -- there is the reality of enormous wealth in the hands of a few, while billions of people in the world are hungry, sick, homeless."
15835,"I see this as the central issue of our time: how to find a substitute for war in human ingenuity, imagination, courage, sacrifice, patience... War is not inevitable, however persistent it is, however long a history it has in human affairs. It does not come out of some instinctive human need. It is manufactured by political leaders, who then must make a tremendous effort--by enticement, by propaganda, by coercion--to mobilize a normally reluctant population to go to war."
15836,"History is instructive. And what it suggests to people is that even if they do little things, if they walk on the picket line, if they join a vigil, if they write a letter to their local newspaper. Anything they do, however small, becomes part of a much, much larger sort of flow of energy. And when enough people do enough things, however small they are, then change takes place."
15837,"Because of the control of the media by corporate wealth, the discovery of truth depends on an alternative media, such as small radio stations, networks, programs. Also, alternative newspapers, which exist all over the country. Also, cable TV programs, which are not dependent on commercial advertising. Also, the internet, which can reach millions of people by-passing the conventional media."
15838,"Memorial Day will be celebrated ... by the usual betrayal of the dead, by the hypocritical patriotism of the politicians and contractors preparing for more wars, more graves to receive more flowers on future Memorial Days. The memory of the dead deserves a different dedication. To peace, to defiance of governments."
15839,"George Orwell said, ""Whoever controls the past controls the future,"" by which he meant that history is incredibly important in shaping the world view of the next generation of people."
15840,The problem in this world is not civil disobedience...th e problem in this world is civil obedience.
15841,"One percent of the nation owns a third of the wealth. The rest of the wealth is distributed in such a way as to turn those in the 99 percent against one another: small property owners against the propertyless, black against white, native-born against foreign-born, intellectuals and professionals against the uneducated and the unskilled. These groups have resented one another and warred against one another with such vehemence and violence as to obscure their common position as sharers of leftovers in a very wealthy country."
15842,
15843,We are living in dangerously weird times now. Smart people just shrug and admit they're dazed and confused. The only ones left with any confidence at all are the New Dumb. It is the beginning of the end of our world as we knew it. Doom is the operative ethic.
15844,Life has become immeasurably better since I have been forced to stop taking it seriously.
15845,The downward spiral of Dumbness in America is about to hit a new low.
15846,Insanity is a legal term. Crazy is an art form.
15847,The main problem in any democracy is that crowd-pleasers are generally brainless swine who can go out on a stage & whup their supporters into an orgiastic frenzy - then go back to the office & sell every one of the poor bastards down the tube for a nickel apiece. Probably the rarest form of life in American politics is the man who can turn on a crowd & still keep his head straight - assuming it was straight in the first place.
15848,"We are all alone, born alone, die alone, and -- in spite of True Romance magazines -- we shall all someday look back on our lives and see that, in spite of our company, we were alone the whole way. I do not say lonely -- at least, not all the time -- but essentially, and finally, alone. This is what makes your self-respect so important, and I don't see how you can respect yourself if you must look in the hearts and minds of others for your happiness."
15849,"When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro."
15850,"Every man is the sum total of his reactions to experience. As your experiences differ and multiply, you become a different man, and hence your perspective changes. This goes on and on. Every reaction is a learning process; every significant experience alters your perspective."
15851,I learned a long time ago that reality was much weirder than anyone's imagination.
15852,Hope rises and dreams flicker and die. Love plans for tomorrow and loneliness thinks of yesterday. Life is beautiful and living is pain.
15853,Human beings are the only creatures on earth that claim a God and the only thing that behaves like it hasn't got one.
15854,Beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life. Decide how you want to live and then see what you can do to make a living WITHIN that way of life.
15855,"Anybody who thinks that 'it doesn't matter who's President' has never been Drafted and sent off to fight and die in a vicious, stupid war on the other side of the world-or been beaten and gassed by Police for trespassing on public property-or been hounded by the IRS for purely political reasons-or locked up in the Cook County Jail with a broken nose and no phone access and twelve perverts wanting to stomp your ass in the shower. That is when it matters who is President or Governor or Police Chief. That is when you will wish you had voted."
15856,"On some nights, I still believe that a car with the gas needle on empty can run about fifty more miles if you have the right music very loud on the radio."
15857,"Sleep late, have fun, get wild, drink whisky and drive fast on empty streets with nothing in mind but falling in love and not getting arrested."
15858,You won't find reasonable men on the tops of tall mountains.
15859,A man who procrastinates in his choosing will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance.
15860,"They say that ""he who flies highest, falls farthest"" - and who am I to argue? But we can't forget that ""he who doesn't flap his wings, never flies at all""."
15861,Anything that gets your blood racing is probably worth doing.
15862,"Never turn your back on fear. It should always be in front of you, like a thing that might have to be killed."
15863,"So we shall let the reader answer this question for himself: who is the happier man, he who has braved the storm of life and lived or he who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed?"
15864,Never fire a warning shot. It is a waste of ammunition.
15865,"Coming of age in a fascist police state will not be a barrel of fun for anybody, much less for people like me, who are not inclined to suffer Nazis gladly and feel only contempt for the cowardly flag-suckers who would gladly give up their outdated freedom to live for the mess of pottage they have been conned into believing will be freedom from fear."
15866,Love plans for tomorrow and loneliness thinks of yesterday.
15867,
15868,Anyone who criticizes you cares about your friendship. Anyone who makes light of your faults cares nothing about you.
15869,"If you advise someone on the condition that they have to accept it, then you are an oppressor."
15870,"What indicates a person’s weak religion and fear of God, is that he seeks for an opinion that suits his desire."
15871,Truthfulness is composed of justice and courage.
15872,"Do not use your energy except for a cause more noble than yourself. Such a cause cannot be found except in Almighty God Himself: to preach the truth, to defend womanhood, to repel humiliation which your Creator has not imposed upon you, to help the oppressed. Anyone who uses his energy for the sake of the vanities of the world is like someone who exchanges gemstones for gravel. There is no nobility in anyone who lacks faith. The wise man knows that the only fitting price for his soul is a place in Paradise."
15873,There are two things that if you do them you will attain the good of this world and the hereafter; [They are] that you bear what you dislike if it is beloved to Allah and you leave what you like if it is disliked by Allah.
15874,One hour of neglect can undo a year of pious effort.
15875,"""When we contemplate the duration of the universe, we see it limited to the present moment, which is nothing more but the point which separates two infinities of time. The past and the future are as meaningless as if they did not exist. Is anyone more misguided than the man who barters an eternal future for a moment which passes quicker than the blink of an eye?."""
15876,Glad-tidings to he who knows his own faults more than other people know it.
15877,"If your pride leads you to boast, 
you will be doubly guilty,
because your intelligence will have shown
that it is incapable of controlling your pride."

15879,"Anyone who rises above the things of this world, to which you kneel, is mightier than you."
15880,"Of Love--may God exalt you! -the first part is jesting, and the last part is right earnestness. So majestic are its diverse aspects, they are too subtle to be described; their reality can only be apprehended by personal experience. Love is neither disapproved by Religion, nor prohibited by the Law; for every heart is in God's hands."
15881,The wise man knows the only fitting price for his soul is a place in Paradise.
15882,"If you are proud of your descent from virtuous ancestors, how empty their virtue will leave your hands if you yourself are not virtuous. How little pride your ancestors will have in you in this world and the next if you do no good! All men are children of Adam whom Allah created by His own Hands, giving him paradise for a dwelling place and letting His angels bow down before him. But how little is the advantage from this since all the vices dwell in mankind and all the wicked impious people are among their number."
15883,"Two kinds of people live a life without care: one kind are extremely worthy of praise, the other kind are extremely worthy of criticism. The first are those who care nothing for the pleasures of the world and the second (i.e. those who are deserving of criticism) care nothing for haya or modesty."
15884,"If there is someone in need whom you wish to help, whether the initiative came from him or from you, do no more than he expects of you, not what you might personally wish to do. If you overstep the mark, you will not deserve thanks, but blame from him and others and you will attract hostility, not friendship."
15885,"No one is moved to act, or resolves to speak a single word, who does not hope by means of this action or word to release anxiety from his spirit."
15886,We should think of those who were famous for their good deeds or their bad deeds; did their fame raise them one single degree in the sight of Allah. Did it win them a reward that they had not already won by their actions during their life?
15887,"And though the years before I die 
 Stretch out interminably, I 
 Shall only count my life in truth 
 As that brief hour of happy youth."
15888,
15889,"A real man is one who fears the death of his heart, not of his body."
15890,"Happiness is attained by three things: being patient when tested, being thankful when receiving a blessing, and being repentant upon sinning."
15891,When Allah tests you it is never to destroy you. When He removes something in your possession it is only in order to empty your hands for an even greater gift.
15892,A person’s tongue can give you the taste of his heart.
15893,"If a heart becomes attached to anything other than Allah, Allah makes him dependent on what he is attached to. And he will be betrayed by it."
15894,"If you knew the true value of yourself, you will never allow yourself to be humiliated by committing sins."
15895,There are six stages to knowledge: Firstly: Asking questions in a good manner. Secondly: Remaining quiet and listening attentively. Thirdly: Understanding well. Fourthly: Memorising. Fifthly: Teaching. Sixthly- and it is its fruit: Acting upon the knowledge and keeping to its limits.
15896,Be sincere in your aim and you will find the support of Allaah surrounding you.
15897,"Had Allah lifted the veil for his slave and shown him how He handles his affairs for him, and how Allah is more keen for the benefit of the slave than his own self, his heart would have melted out of the love for Allah and would have been torn to pieces out of thankfulness to Allah. Therefore if the pains of this world tire you, do not grieve. For it may be that Allah wishes to hear your voice by way of Dua'a. So pour out your desires in prostration and forget about it and know; that verily Allah does not forget it."
15898,Women are one half of society which gives birth to the other half so it is as if they are the entire society.

15901,"Truly in the heart there is a void that can not be removed except with the company of Allah. And in it there is a sadness that can not be removed except with the happiness of knowing Allah and being true to Him. And in it there is an emptiness that can not be filled except with love for Him and by turning to Him and always remembering Him. And if a person were given all of the world and what is in it, it would not fill this emptiness."
15902,"A slave stands infront of Allah on two occasions. The first during salah, and secondly on the Day of Judgment. Whoseover stands correctly in the first, the second standing will be made easier for him. And whosoever, disregards the first standing, the second standing will be extremely difficult."
15903,"If you wish to check how much you love Allah, then see how much your heart loves the Quran, and you will know the answer."
15904,"When Allah granted Prophet Yoosuf (`alayhis-Salaam) physical beauty it caused him to be locked up in the prison; but when Allah granted him knowledge (when he interpreted the dream of the king) it not only took him out of prison, but elevated his rank in society, clearly showing us the virtue of knowledge and that physical beauty does not mean anything."
15905,"Beware of every hour and how it passes, and only spend it in the best possible way, do not neglect yourself, but render it accustomed to the noblest and best of actions, and send to your grave that which will please you when you arrive to it."

15908,"As long as you are performing prayer, you are knocking at the door of Allah, and whoever is knocking at the door of Allah, Allah will open it for him."
15909,Sitting with the poor and less fortunate people removes the ego and pride from your heart.
15910,"Be to Allah as He wishes, and He will be to you more than you can wish for."
15911,The soul will never become pious and purified except through undergoing afflictions. It is the same as gold that can never be pure except after removing all the base metals in it.
15912,"From the perfection of Allah's ihsan is that He allows His slave to taste the bitterness of the break before the sweetness of the mend. So He does not break his believing slave, except to mend him. And He does not withhold from him, except to give him. And He does not test him (with hardship), except to cure him."

15917,"If I remained silent and you remained silent, then who will teach the ignorant?"
15918,"What can my enemies do to me? My paradise is in my heart, it is with me wherever I go. To imprison me is to provide me with seclusion. To send me into exile is to send me away in the Path of Allah. And to kill me is to make me a martyr."

15922,"Seek (beneficial) knowledge, 
 because seeking it for the sake of Allaah is a worship. 
 And knowing it makes you more God-fearing; 
 and searching for it is jihad, 
 teaching it to those who do not know is charity, 
 reviewing and learning it more is like tasbeeh. 
 Through knowledge Allaah will be known and worshiped."
15923,The sincere hearts and the pious supplications are soldiers which can never be defeated
15924,"You should not look at what the person used to do, rather you should 
 look at what kind of person they are today. The one who gets bogged 
 down about people's pasts, is just like Iblees who said to Allaah, 
 “You created me from fire and you created him from clay”."

15926,"It is strange that a person may find it easy to protect himself from: eating Haraam, oppression and injustice, adultery, theft, drinking khamr (alcoholic drinks), and from unlawful looking, but it is hard for him to restrain the movement of his tongue. How often do we see people who are very cautious about falling into shameful deeds or injustice, but their tongue lashes against the living and the dead and they don't mind it?"

15963,
15964,"We recognize a tree by its fruit, and we ought to be able to recognize a Christian by his action.  The fruit of faith should be evident in our lives, for being a Christian is more than making sound professions of faith.  It should reveal itself in practical and visible ways.  Indeed it is better to keep quiet about our beliefs, and live them out, than to talk eloquently about what we believe, but fail to live by it."
15965,"Do not have Jesus Christ on your lips, and the world in your heart."

[] Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church.

15972,"Take heed often to come together to give thanks to God and show forth His praise. For when you assemble frequently in the same place, the powers of Satan are destroyed, and the destruction at which he aims is prevented by the unity of your faith."
15973,"It is impossible for a man to be freed from the habit of sin before he hates it, just as it is impossible to receive forgiveness before confessing his trespasses."
15974,"No earthly pleasures, no kingdoms of this world can benefit me in any way. I prefer death in Christ Jesus to power over the farthest limits of the earth. He who died in place of us is the one object of my quest. He who rose for our sakes is my one desire. Do not talk about Jesus Christ as long as you love this world."
15975,Do everything as if He were dwelling in us. Thus we shall be His temples and He will be within us as our God - as He actually is.
15976,"Now do I begin to be a disciple of Christ, and care for nothing in this world, that so I may find Jesus. Let fire, or the cross, or wild beasts, or the breaking of my bones, or the cutting of me to pieces, or the shattering of my whole body, yea, all the tortures of the devil - let them all come upon me, only let me enjoy my God."

15980,"It is not that I want merely to be called a Christian, but actually to be one. Yes, if I prove to be one, then I can have the name."
15981,"But look at the men who have those perverted notions about the grace of Jesus Christ which has come down to us, and see how contrary to the mind of God they are. . . . They even abstain from the Eucharist and from the public prayers, because they will not admit that the Eucharist is the self-same body of our Savior Jesus Christ which flesh suffered for our sins, and which the Father of His goodness raised up again."
15982,"I hunger for the bread of God, the flesh of Jesus Christ ...; I long to drink of his blood, the gift of unending love."

15987,"For Faith is the beginning and the end is love, and God is the two of them brought into unity. After these comes whatever else makes up a Christian gentleman."
15988,
15989,"It is not expensive to be beautiful. It takes only a little effort to be presentable and beautiful. But it takes some effort.

16001,"In the material world, where everything is valued, when you commit yourself to God, beauty and love, it can be mistaken for extravagance."
16002,"The Marcos era was the golden time for the Philippines. We had the lowest crime rate in the world in Manila and real development then. At last, people are starting to understand this."
16003,"I am my little people's star and slave. When I go out into the barrios, I get dressed because I know my little people want to see a star. Other presidents' wives have gone to the barrios wearing house dresses and slippers. That's not what people want to see. People want someone they can love, someone to set an example."
16004,"It is shallow people who think beauty is frivolous or excessive. If you are bringing beauty and god, you are enriching the country. Rice feeds the body, books feed the mind, beauty feeds the soul. It is one thing I can really be proud of and stand tall in the world."

16088,"I said, ""I don't think I can give you that kind of emotion."" And he [Hitchcock] sat there and said, ""Ingrid, fake it!"" Well, that was the best advice I've had in my whole life, because in all the years to come there were many directors who gave me what I thought were quite impossible instructions and many difficult things to do, and just when I was on the verge of starting to argue with them, I heard his voice coming to me through the air saying, ""Ingrid, fake it!"" It saved a lot of unpleasant situations and waste of time."

16152,All alone by the telephone.
16153,
16154,Train yourselves. Don't wait to be fed knowledge out of a book. Get out and seek it. Make explorations. Do your own research work. Train your hands and your mind. Become curious. Invent your own problems and solve them. You can see things going on all about you. Inquire into them. Seek out answers to your own questions. There are many phenomena going on in nature the explanation of which cannot be found in books. Find out why these phenomena take place. Information a boy gets by himself is enormously more valuable than that which is taught to him in school.
16155,Only a small part of scientific progress has resulted from planned search for specific objectives.  A much more important part has been made possible by the freedom of the individual to follow his own curiosity.
16156,A chemist who does not know mathematics is seriously handicapped.
16157,"History proves abundantly that pure science, undertaken without regard to applications to human needs, is usually ultimately of direct benefit to mankind."
16158,"Science, almost from its beginnings, has been truly international in character. National prejudices disappear completely in the scientist's search for truth."
16159,"To my mind, the most important aspect of the Nobel Awards is that they bring home to the masses of the peoples of all nations, a realization of their common interests. They carry to those who have no direct contact with science the international spirit."
16160,"Happy indeed is the scientist who not only has the pleasures which I have enumerated, but who also wins the recognition of fellow scientists and of the mankind which ultimately benefits from his endeavors."
16161,Medicine also disregards national boundaries.
16162,"[In the case of research director, Willis R. Whitney, whose style was to give talented investigators as much freedom as possible, you may define ""serendipity"" as] the art of profiting from unexpected occurrences. When you do things in that way you get unexpected results. Then you do something else and you get unexpected results in another line, and you do that on a third line and then all of a sudden you see that one of these lines has something to do with the other. Then you make a discovery that you never could have made by going on a direct road."
16163,And literature frequently rises to heights that make it international.
16164,"Many of the things that have happened in the laboratory have happened in ways it would have been impossible to foresee, but not impossible to plan for in a sense. I do not think Dr. Whitney deliberately plans his serendipity but he is built that way; he has the art-an instinctive way of preparing himself by his curiosity and by his interest in people and in all kinds of things and in nature, so that the things he learns react on one another and thereby accomplish things that would be impossible to foresee and plan."
16165,"[There] are cases where there is no dishonesty involved but where people are tricked into false results by a lack of understanding about what human beings can do to themselves in the way of being led astray by subjective effects, wishful thinking or threshold interactions. These are examples of pathological science. These are things that attracted a great deal of attention. Usually hundreds of papers have been published upon them. Sometimes they have lasted for fifteen or twenty years and then they gradually die away."

16170,"Remember, ""I"" before ""E"", except in Budweiser."
16171,"Why do I wear tennis shoes? That's two questions. Do I wear tennis shoes? The answer to that question is, ""Yes."" ""Why?"" That's a question philosophers have been pondering for centuries."
16172,"With the beginning of a great & compassionate love, comes the growth of one's heart, and with that, a profound inner change. The way to opening the mind is often first through the heart. And once is the mind & heart are open, so many things become possible."
16173,"Borrow from your friends, and when they ain't got any more money, make new friends."
16174,Today we must all be aware that protocol takes precedence over procedure.

16180,"Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is. The only function of a school is to make self-education easier; failing that, it does nothing."
16181,"When stupidity is considered patriotism, it is unsafe to be intelligent."
16182,

16184,"Maybe happiness is this: not feeling like you should be elsewhere, doing something else, being someone else."
16185,Today's science fiction is tomorrow's science fact.
16186,"What is really amazing, and frustrating, is mankind's habit of refusing to see the obvious and inevitable until it is there, and then muttering about unforeseen catastrophes."
16187,
16188,People think of education as something that they can finish.
16189,"So the universe is not quite as you thought it was. You'd better rearrange your beliefs, then. Because you certainly can't rearrange the universe."

16193,Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.
16194,The greatest weapons in the conquest of knowledge are an understanding mind and the inexorable curiosity that drives it on.
16195,
16196,There’s nothing to it. All you have to do is take a close look at yourself and you will understand everyone else. We’re in no way different ourselves... You show me someone who can’t understand people and I’ll show you someone who has built up a false image of himself.
16197,"I have been told that a young would-be composer wrote to Mozart asking advice about how to compose a symphony. Mozart responded that a symphony was a complex and demanding form and it would be better to start with something simpler. The young man protested, 'But, Herr Mozart, you wrote symphonies when you were younger than I am now.' Mozart replied, 'I never asked how."
16198,"There is no belief, however foolish, that will not gather its faithful adherents who will defend it to the death."
16199,Never let your sense of morals get in the way of doing what's right.
16200,"Imagine the people who believe such things and who are not ashamed to ignore, totally, all the patient findings of thinking minds through all the centuries since the Bible was written. And it is these ignorant people, the most uneducated, the most unimaginative, the most unthinking among us, who would make themselves the guides and leaders of us all; who would force their feeble and childish beliefs on us; who would invade our schools and libraries and homes. I personally resent it bitterly."
16201,Life is pleasant. Death is peaceful. It's the transition that's troublesome.
16202,"To make discoveries, you have to be curious about why the universe is the way it is."
16203,"If you have talent, you will receive some measure of success - but only if you persist."
16204,
16205,"For those who are willing to make an effort, great miracles and wonderful treasures are in store."
16206,"What do they know-all these scholars, all these philosophers, all the leaders of the world - about such as you? They have convinced themselves that man, the worst transgressor of all the species, is the crown of creation. All other creatures were created merely to provide him with food, pelts, to be tormented, exterminated. In relation to them, all people are Nazis; for the animals it is an eternal Treblinka."
16207,We must believe in free will - we have no choice.
16208,"When a day passes, it is no longer there. What remains of it? Nothing more than a story. If stories weren't told or books weren't written, man would live like the beasts, only for the day."
16209,"It is a general rule that when the grain of truth cannot be found, men will swallow great helpings of falsehood."
16210,"In their behavior toward creatures, all men are Nazis. Human beings see oppression vividly when they're the victims. Otherwise they victimize blindly and without a thought."
16211,"When you betray somebody else, you also betray yourself."
16212,"As long as people will shed the blood of innocent creatures there can be no peace, no liberty, no harmony between people. Slaughter and justice cannot dwell together."
16213,Life is God's novel. Let him write it.
16214,"If you keep saying things are going to be bad, you have a good chance of being a prophet."
16215,"There are 500 reasons I write for children.... Children read books, not reviews. They don't give a hoot about the critics.... They don't read to free themselves of guilt, to quench their thirst for rebellion, or to get rid of alienation. They still believe in God, the family, angels, devils, witches, goblins, logic, clarity, punctuation, and other such obsolete stuff.... They don't expect their beloved writer to redeem humanity. Young as they are, they know that it is not in his power. Only the adults have such childish illusions."
16216,"Whenever I'm in trouble, I pray. And because I'm in trouble all of the time, I pray almost constantly."
16217,"Man prays for mercy, but is unwilling to extend it to others. Why then should man expect mercy from God? It is 
unfair to expect something that you are not willing to give."
16218,"I did not become a vegetarian for my health, I did it for the health of the chickens."
16219,Sometimes love is stronger than a man's convictions.
16220,"People often say that humans have always eaten animals, as if this is a justification for continuing the practice. According to this logic, we should not try to prevent people from murdering other people, since this has also been done since the earliest of times."
16221,"Night is a time of rigor, but also of mercy. There are truths which one can see only when it’s dark"
16222,"God gave us so many emotions, and so many strong ones. Every human being, even if he is an idiot, is a millionaire in emotions."
16223,"But if we have people who have the power to tell a story, there will always be readers."
16224,"The more you see what other people do, the more you learn about yourself."
16225,The greatness of art is not to find what is common but what is unique.

16230,Live your life as an Exclamation rather than an Explanation
16231,
16232,"Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who sets the planets in motion."
16233,
16234,"Atheism is so senseless. When I look at the solar system, I see the earth at the right distance from the sun to receive the proper amounts of heat and light. This did not happen by chance."
16235,"If I had stayed for other people to make my tools and things for me, I had never made anything."
16236,All knowledge and understanding of the Universe was no more than playing with stones and shells on the seashore of the vast imponderable ocean of truth.
16237,No great discovery was ever made without a bold guess.
16238,Every action has an equal and opposite reaction
16239,Poetry is a kind of ingenious nonsense.
16240,Tact is the art of making a point without making an enemy.
16241,To explain all nature is too difficult a task for any one man or even for any one age
16242,"I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people."
16243,All my discoveries have been made in answer to prayer.
16244,"I know not how I seem to others, but to myself I am but a small child wandering upon the vast shores of knowledge, every now and then finding a small bright pebble to content myself with while the vast ocean of undiscovered truth lay before me."
16245,"I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only a boy playing on the seashore."
16246,"In the absence of any other proof, the thumb alone would convince me of God's existence."
16247,To arrive at the simplest truth requires years of contemplation.
16248,My powers are ordinary. Only my application brings me success.
16249,
16250,"I do not think that this [the universe] can be explained only by natural causes, and are forced to impute to the wisdom and ingenuity of an intelligent."
16251,I can measure the motion of bodies but I cannot measure human folly.
16252,Truth is the offspring of silence and meditation.
16253,"My principal method for defeating error and heresy is by establishing the truth. One purposes to fill a bushel with tares, but if I can fill it first with wheat, I may defy his attempts."
16254,
16255,Youth is not a period in life but a state of mind.
16256,"It is a wonderful truth that things we want most in life-a sense of purpose, happiness and hope-are most easily attained by giving them to others."
16257,"Life is very mysterious and there are many things we don't know. And there are elements of magic realism in every culture, everywhere. It's just accepting that we don't know everything and everything is possible."
16258,We all have an unsuspected reserve of strength inside that emerges when life puts us to the test.
16259,The hardest thing of love is to let go.
16260,"Fear is inevitable, I have to accept that, but I cannot allow it to paralyze me."
16261,"I can promise you that women working together - linked, informed and educated - can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet."
16262,You only have what you give. It’s by spending yourself that you become rich.
16263,"At my age, people prefer to stay in a relationship that is not working. I do not understand that. I think it takes a lot of courage to separate. But it takes more energy to stay in something that is not working."
16264,"For women, the best aphrodisiacs are words. The G-spot is in the ears. He who looks for it below there is wasting his time."
16265,Words are not that important when you recognize intentions.
16266,"Roots are not in landscape or a country, or a people, they are inside you."
16267,"There is no death, daughter. People die only when we forget them,' my mother explained shortly before she left me. 'If you can remember me, I will be with you always."
16268,"Give, give, give - what is the point of having experience, knowledge or talent if I don't give it away? Of having stories if I don't tell them to others? Of having wealth if I don't share it? I don't intend to be cremated with any of it! It is in giving that I connect with others, with the world and with the divine."
16269,"There is no light without shadow, just as there is no happiness without pain."
16270,How many times have I told you not to believe everything you hear? Seek truth for yourself.

16277,We only have what we give.
16278,"For real change, we need feminine energy in the management of the world. We need a critical number of women in positions of power, and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men."
16279,
16280,I've never lived in a building without my name on it.
16281,"I've never had a sense of entitlement. I saw how hard my father worked for his money, and it was always made very clear to me that things wouldn't just be given to me."
16282,It's very hard to be great at what you do if you aren't deeply passionate.
16283,"My father values talent. He recognizes real knowledge and skill when he finds it. He is color blind and gender neutral. He hires the best person for the job, period."
16284,Everything about mediocrity kills me.
16285,Work is changing for men as much as it is for women.
16286,"In both business and personal life, I've always found that travel inspires me more than anything else I do. Evidence of the languages, cultures, scenery, food, and design sensibilities that I discover all over the world can be found in every piece of my jewelry."
16287,The beauty of America is people can do what they like.
16288,"I set very bold goals. It's how I've always been. I'm definitely somebody who swings for the fences, and I expect very high performance."
16289,"People underestimate me, and that's fine. I prefer to go into negotiations being underestimated."

16291,"It's important to get in the habit of growing as a human being, developing and refining leadership and management skills and entrepreneurial instincts and changing to accommodate the times."
16292,"My father represents a very interesting challenge to the Republican party. I think this is taking people by surprise. (But) I think that's why he's so welcomed by the American voters, because they want somebody who says what they are thinking."
16293,"Jewelry is incredibly feminine, and reflects the grace and beauty of a women's style like nothing else."
16294,"If people think they can elicit from me whatever terms they want, they are mistaken."
16295,I make money because I have to pay for everything apart from my school fees. My mother even makes me pay my own telephone bill.
16296,"Real estate is my life. It is my day job, if you will. But it consumes my nights and weekends, too."
16297,"You realize in life, not that many things matter that much, but your choice of a spouse is everything."

16299,"I've also built my own business, and obviously it's a brand that I've built and it's wholly owned by me and something that certainly my experience observing him and working with him and for him has informed how I make business decisions around my brand. But it's my company."
16300,"Traditionally women have been more reticent to acknowledge their ambition and to say it with pride. So I like having people who work for us who are ambitious, engaged, respectful. Mis-hiring is a huge mistake. It's a tremendous opportunity cost throwing the position to the wrong person."
16301,"I'm so grateful to my parents for my upbringing and for all of the opportunities that I was provided with, but I also learned at a young age that success is not given, it is earned and that has always been something that motivates me."

16303,"I was in total shock. I work so close [to home] that I figured I'd return to work and the baby nurse would bring the baby to me, and I'd run home periodically, and I'd make it work. But every two hours? That's a whole other level. I'll have to make a nursery at the office."
16304,"No matter what is going on in your life today, remember, it is only preparation. People come and go; situations rise and fall; it's all preparation for better things. You must stretch, reach, grow into your goodness. Without the preparation we receive through adversity, disappointment, confusion, or pain, we could not appreciate the goodness when it arrives."
16305,"Everything you have done and been through is valuable and important. In order to be who you are, to know what you know, to be where you are in this moment, you needed to go through what you went through."
16306,"You have to meet people where they are, and sometimes you have to leave them there."
16307,"What keeps us from achieving our heart's desires is not anything outside of us, it's the conflict inside."
16308,"If you really want to live your life to the fullest and realize your greatest potential, you must be willing to run the risk of making some people mad. People may not like what you do, people may not like how you do it, but these people are not living your life. You are!"

This is the time when you must stand toe to toe, eyeball to eyeball, with the very thing you have tried desperately to avoid.

16311,Your willingness to look at your darkness is what empowers you to change
16312,"Forgiveness is a process of giving up the old for something new. Old experiences and memories that we hold on to in anger, resentment, shame, or guilt cloud our spirit mind. The truth is, everything that has happened had to happen. It was a growth experience. There was something you needed to know or learn. If you stay angry, hurt, afraid, ashamed, or guilty, you miss the lesson. You will be stuck in a cloud of pain."
16313,"Every day is your day if you claim it. If you wait for somebody else to make it for you, you're going to be disappointed."
16314,"Nothing destroys self-worth, self-acceptance and self-love faster than denying what you feel. Without feelings, you would not know where you are in life. Nor would you know what areas you need to work on. Honor your feelings. Allow yourself to feel them."
16315,"Each day, focus your attention on what you want. Each day, take one step that will bring you closer to it. ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE! The key is to identify it, claim it for yourself, and believe that you are worthy to have it."
16316,"The highest form of praise you can offer to yourself, to God and to the world is to spend time each day expressing gratitude. It says to God that you are aware and appreciative of grace. It says to life that you are acknowledging its awesome presence in you. It says to yourself that you are worth the time it takes to be healed. Time spent in silence, contemplation and gratitude is time spent in devotion to a higher calling and a more loving state of being."
16317,"It's important that we share our experiences with other people. Your story will heal you and your story will heal somebody else. When you tell your story, you free yourself and give other people permission to acknowledge their own story"
16318,"You cannot make your life move faster than it's moving. No matter how urgent your situation may seem to be, things are going to happen when they happen, not a minute sooner. Be patient with yourself. Be patient with others. Be patient with life. Patience always pays off."
16319,"Have the courage to be exactly who you are without apology. Admit your mistakes without beating yourself up. Release all shame! Release all guilt! You cannot live if you are hiding behind what was. Focus on what is, right now, and that is you!"
16320,"When you can tell the story and it doesn't bring up any pain, you know it is healed."
16321,"Everything happens when it needs to happen; everyone is always where they need to be. You will never miss out on what is meant for you, even if it has to come to you in a roundabout way."
16322,"Gratitude is like a magnet; the more grateful you are, the more you will receive to be grateful for."
16323,"When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives."
16324,Challenges come so we can grow and be prepared for things we are not equipped to handle now.
16325,Stop hiding! Stop holding yourself back and playing yourself down! Stop worrying about how you look and what people are saying. Stop listening to what people are saying and trying to find out if they are whispering about you. Stop waiting for someone to tell you that you are okay or to make you feel special. Life is special! It is a special gift. This is your life! Now take your gift and live it out in the open! Decide today that you are going to live out loud!
16326,"You can accept or reject the way you are treated by other people, but until you heal the wounds of your past, you will continue to bleed. You can bandage the bleeding with food, with alcohol, with drugs, with work, with cigarettes, with sex, but eventually, it will all ooze through and stain your life. You must find the strength to open the wounds, stick your hands inside, pull out the core of the pain that is holding you in your past, the memories, and make peace with them."
16327,"When the time comes for you to make a change or to grow, the universe will make you so uncomfortable you will eventually have no choice."
16328,"If you should encounter angry or unkind actions today, take a deep breath, reach deep within and greet the lack of love with love."
16329,"It costs something to be a real Christian, according to the standard of the Bible. There are enemies to be overcome, battles to be fought, sacrifices to be made, an Egypt to be forsaken, a wilderness to be passed through, a cross to be carried, a race to be run. Conversion is not putting a person in an arm-chair and taking them easily to heaven. It is the beginning of a mighty conflict, in which it costs much to win the victory."
16330,"Trials are intended to make us think, to wean us from the world, to send us to the Bible, to drive us to our knees."
16331,"If you love Christ, never be ashamed to let others see it and know it. Speak for Him. Witness for Him. Live for Him."
16332,"Read the Bible daily. Make it part of your everyday business to read and meditate on some portion of God's Word. Gather your manna fresh every morning. Choose your own seasons and hours. Do not scramble over and hurry your reading. Give your Bible the best, and not the worst, part of your time. But whatever plan you pursue, let it be a rule of your life to visit the throne of grace and the Bible every day."
16333,"Beware of manufacturing a God of your own: a God who is all mercy, but not just; a God who is all love, but not holy; a God who as a heaven for every body, but a hell for none; a God who can allow good and bad to be side by side in time, but will make no distinction between good and broad in eternity. Such a God is an idol of your own, as truly an idol as any snake or crocodile in an Egyptian temple. The hands of your own fancy and sentimentality have made him. He is not the God of the Bible, and beside the God of the Bible there is no God at all."
16334,"We must give up the vain idea of trying to please everybody. That is impossible, and the attempt is a mere waste of time. We must be content to walk in Christ's steps, and let the world say what it likes."
16335,"Do nothing that you would not like God to see. Say nothing you would not like God to hear. Write nothing you would not like God to read. Go no place where you would not like God to find you. Read no book of which you would not like God to say, ""Show it to Me."" Never spend your time in such a way that you would not like to have God say, ""What are you doing?"
16336,"Praying and sinning will never live together in the same heart. Prayer will consume sin, or sin will choke prayer."
16337,"Fear not because your prayer is stammering, your words feeble, and your language poor. Jesus can understand you."
16338,"Let us seek friends that will stir up our prayers, our Bible reading, our use of time, and our salvation."
16339,"Let us cleave to Christ more closely, love Him more heartily, live to Him more thoroughly, copy Him more exactly, confess Him more boldly, and follow Him more fully."
16340,"My chief desire in all my writings, is to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ and make Him beautiful and glorious in the eyes of people; and to promote the increase of repentance, faith, and holiness upon earth."
16341,Let us beware of repentance without evidence.
16342,"Do not glory in your own faith, your own feelings, your own knowledge, or your own diligence. Glory in nothing but Christ."
16343,"A Christian is a walking sermon. They preach far more than a minister does, for they preach all week long."
16344,"If we are true Christians, we must not expect everything smooth in our journey to heaven. We must count it no strange thing, if we have to endure sicknesses, losses, bereavements, and disappointments, just like other men. Free pardon and full forgiveness, grace along the way, and glory at the endall this our Savior has promised to give. But He has never promised that we shall have no afflictions."
16345,"Our Lord has many weak children in his family, many dull pupils in his school, many raw soldiers in his army, many lame sheep in his flock. Yet he bears with them all, and casts none away. Happy is that Christian who has learned to do likewise with his brethren."

16593,"Nothing is more disgusting than the majority: because it consists of a few powerful predecessors, of rogues who adapt themselves, of weak who assimilate themselves, and the masses who imitate without knowing at all what they want."
16594,"I have come to the frightening conclusion that I am the decisive element. It is my personal approach that creates the climate. It is my daily mood that makes the weather....In all situations, it is my response that decides whether a crisis is escalated or de-escalated, and a person is humanized or is dehumanized."
16595,"Man's highest merit always is, as much as possible, to rule external circumstances and as little as possible to let himself be ruled by them."
16596,A man who cannot command himself will always be a slave.

Love enough to move you to be useful and helpful to others. Faith enough to make real the things of God. Hope enough to remove all anxious fears concerning the future.
16604,
16605,Nothing of significance was ever achieved by an individual acting alone.  Look below the surface and you will find that all seemingly solo acts are really team efforts.
16606,"Leaders become great, not because of their power, but because of their ability to empower others."
16607,You will never change your life until you change something you do daily. The secret of your success is found in your daily routine.
16608,Your life today is a result of your thinking yesterday. Your life tomorrow will be determined by what you think today.
16609,You will never change your life until you change something you do daily. Success doesn't just suddenly occur one day in someone's life. Neither does failure. Each is a process. Every day of your life is merely preparation for the next. What you become is the result of what you do today.
16610,The only one you should compare yourself to is you. Your mission is to become better today than you were yesterday.
16611,"The more you do, the more you fail. The more you fail, the more you learn. The more you learn, the better you get."

16619,"We cannot choose how many years we will live, but we can choose how much life those years will have. We cannot control the beauty of our face, but we can control the expression on it. We cannot control life's difficult moments but we can choose to make life less difficult. We cannot control the negative atmosphere of the world, but we can control the atmosphere of our minds. Too often we try to choose and control things we cannot. Too seldom we choose to control what we can ... our attitude."
16620,
16621,"Your attitude is either your best friend or your worst enemy, your 
greatest asset or your greatest liability"

16648,"We are not here to curse the darkness, but to light the candle that can guide us through that darkness to a safe and sane future."
16649,Those who dare to fail miserably can achieve greatly.
16650,"A full scale nuclear exchange, lasting less than 60 minutes...could wipe out more than 300 million Americans, Europeans, and Russians, as well as untold numbers elsewhere. And the survivors-as Chairman Khrushchev warned the Communist Chinese, `the survivors would envy the dead.' For they would inherit a world so devastated by explosions and poison and fire that today we cannot conceive of its horrors."
16651,Never let your fears hold you back from pursuing your hopes.
16652,A boy spends his time finding a girl to sleep with. A real man spends his time looking for the one worth waking up to.

16656,Good friends are hard to find and impossible to forget.
16657,"I'm not sure if I'm depressed. I mean, I'm not exactly sad. But I'm not exactly happy either. I can laugh and joke and smile during the day, But sometimes when I'm alone at night I forget how to feel."
16658,"We all want to do something to mitigate the pain of loss or to turn grief into something positive, to find a silver lining in the clouds. But I believe there is real value in just standing there, being still, being sad."

16667,Grief doesn't change you. It reveals you.
16668,"The good times and the bad times both will pass. It will pass. It will get easier. But the fact that it will get easier does not mean that it doesn’t hurt now. And when people try to minimize your pain they are doing you a disservice. And when you try to minimize your own pain you’re doing yourself a disservice. Don’t do that. The truth is that it hurts because it’s real. It hurts because it mattered. And that’s an important thing to acknowledge to yourself. But that doesn’t mean that it won’t end, that it won’t get better. Because it will."

16687,"There are two basic motivating forces: fear and love. When we are afraid, we pull back from life. When we are in love, we open to all that life has to offer with passion, excitement, and acceptance. We need to learn to love ourselves first, in all our glory and our imperfections. If we cannot love ourselves, we cannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potential to create. Evolution and all hopes for a better world rest in the fearlessness and open-hearted vision of people who embrace life."

16700,"The trouble with government as it is, is that it doesn't represent the people. It controls them."
16701,Our society is run by insane people for insane objectives. I think we're being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and I think I'm liable to be put away as insane for expressing that. That's what's insane about it.

16706,What is sin? It is the glory of God not honored. The holiness of God not reverenced. The greatness of God not admired. The power of God not praised. The truth of God not sought. The wisdom of God not esteemed. The beauty of God not treasured. The goodness of God not savored. The faithfulness of God not trusted. The commandments of God not obeyed. The justice of God not respected. The wrath of God not feared. The grace of God not cherished. The presence of God not prized. The person of God not loved. That is sin.
16707,If you can't see the sun you will be impressed with a street light. If you've never felt thunder and lightning you'll be impressed with fireworks. And if you turn your back on the greatness and majesty of God you'll fall in love with a world of shadows and short-lived pleasures.
16708,"My feelings are not God. God is God. My feelings do not define truth. God’s word defines truth. My feelings are echoes and responses to what my mind perceives. And sometimes - many times - my feelings are out of sync with the truth. When that happens - and it happens every day in some measure - I try not to bend the truth to justify my imperfect feelings, but rather, I plead with God: Purify my perceptions of your truth and transform my feelings so that they are in sync with the truth."
16709,Sin is what you do when your heart is not satisfied with God.
16710,Life is not a straight line leading from one blessing to the next and then finally to heaven. Life is a winding and troubled road. Switchback after switchback. And the point of biblical stories like Joseph and Job and Esther and Ruth is to help us feel in our bones (not just know in our heads) that God is for us in all these strange turns. God is not just showing up after the trouble and cleaning it up. He is plotting the course and managing the troubles with far-reaching purposes for our good and for the glory of Jesus Christ.
16711,People don't enjoy salt. They enjoy what is salted. We are the salt of the earth. We do not exist for ourselves.
16712,"A Christian is not a person who believes in his head the teachings of the Bible. Satan believes in his head the teachings of the Bible! A Christian is a person who has died with Christ, whose stiff neck has been broken, whose brazen forehead has been shattered, whose stony heart has been crushed, whose pride has been slain, and whose life is now mastered by Jesus Christ."
16713,"The cross is not a mere event in history; it's a way of life! Take up your cross DAILY, Jesus said!"

16715,God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.
16716,"Our deeds are not the basis of our salvation, they are the evidence of our salvation. They are not foundation, they are demonstration."
16717,"Life is precarious, and life is precious. Don't presume you will have it tomorrow, and don't waste it today."
16718,"If you live gladly to make others glad in God, your life will be hard, your risks will be high, and your joy will be full."
16719,"If you are sufficient for your task, it's too small."
16720,"If God's love for his children is to be measured by our health, wealth, and comfort in this life, God hated the apostle Paul."
16721,"Whenever your heart starts to be anxious about the future, preach to your heart and say, 'Heart, who do you think you are to be afraid of the future and nullify the promise of God? No, heart, I will not exalt myself with anxiety. I will humble myself in peace and joy as I trust this precious and great promise of God - He cares for me.'"
16722,"Life is wasted if we do not grasp the glory of the cross, cherish it for the treasure that it is, and cleave to it as the highest price of every pleasure and the deepest comfort in every pain. What was once foolishness to us—a crucified God—must become our wisdom and our power and our only boast in this world."
16723,"God is always doing 10,000 things in your life, and you may be aware of three of them."
16724,Prayer is the open admission that without Christ we can do nothing. And prayer is the turning away from ourselves to God in the confidence that He will provide the help we need. Prayer humbles us as needy and exalts God as wealthy
16725,Worship is what we were created for. This is the final end of all existence-the worship of God. God created the universe so that it would display the worth of His glory. And He created us so that we would see this glory and reflect it by knowing and loving it-with all our heart and soul and mind and strength. The church needs to build a common vision of what worship is and what she is gathering to do on Sunday morning and scattering to do on Monday morning.
16726,A woman who fears the Lord will not run away from God to satisfy her longings and relieve her anxieties. She will wait for the Lord. She will hope in God. She will stay close to the heart of God and trust in his promises. The prospect of departing into the way of sin will be too fearful to pursue; and the benefits of abiding in the shadow of the Almighty too glorious to forsake.
16727,"O, God of wonder, enlarge my capacity to be amazed at what is amazing, and end my attraction to the insignificant."
16728,Don't ever think that the sin of your past means there is no hope for your future.
16729,
16730,"I think anyone's success depends on working hard, Industriousness and Enthusiasm, enjoying what you are doing. You can't work your best if you're not enjoying what you are doing. No way you can force yourself to."
16731,"A mistake is valuable if you do four things with it: recognize it, admit it, learn from it, forget it"
16732,Stay the course. When thwarted try again; harder; smarter. Persevere relentlessly.
16733,A player who makes a team great is better than a great player.
16734,Do not let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.
16735,"Champions never complain, they are too busy getting better"
16736,"When you improve a little each day, eventually big things occur. When you improve conditioning a little each day, eventually you have a big improvement in conditioning. Not tomorrow, not the next day, but eventually a big gain is made. Don't look for the big, quick improvement. Seek the small improvement one day at a time. That's the only way it happens - and when it happens, it lasts."
16737,"If we fail to adapt, we fail to move forward."
16738,Make each day your masterpiece. Life is now. Life is not later on.
16739,
16740,When opportunity comes it is too late to prepare.
16741,It's the little details that are vital. Little things make big things happen.

16743,"The more concerned we become over the things we can't control, the less we will do with the things we can control"
16744,"If you do enough small things right, big things can happen"
16745,I am not as good as I ought to be. I am not as good as I want to be. I am not as good as I'm going to be. But I am thankful that I am better than I used to be.
16746,What is right is more important than who is right.
16747,"If you spend too much time learning the 'tricks' of the trade, you may not learn the trade. There are no shortcuts. If you're working on finding a short cut, the easy way, you're not working hard enough on the fundamentals. You may get away with it for a spell, but there is no substitute for the basics. And the first basic is good, old fashioned hard work."
16748,"The eight laws of learning are explanation, demonstration, imitation, repetition, repetition, repetition, repetition, repetition."
16749,Talent is God given. Be humble. Fame is man-given. Be grateful. Conceit is self-given. Be careful.
16750,A strong leader accepts blame and gives the credit. A weak leader gives blame and accepts the credit.
16751,It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the credit.
16752,"You must be interested in finding the best way, not in having your own way."
16753,"A player who makes a team great is more valuable than a great player. Losing yourself in the group, for the good of the group - that's teamwork."
16754,
16755,
16756,
16757,"There's no way around grief and loss: you can dodge all you want, but sooner or later you just have to go into it, through it, and, hopefully, come out the other side. The world you find there will never be the same as the world you left."
16758,"All your life, you will be faced with a choice. You can choose love or hate…I choose love."
16759,Life is rough so you gotta be tough.
16760,"I love the freedoms we got in this country, I appreciate your freedom to burn your flag if you want to, but I really appreciate my right to bear arms so I can shoot you if you try to burn mine."
16761,
16762,
16763,"Life and love go on, let the music play."
16764,it's good to know who hates you and it is good to be hated by the right people

16766,"When God forgave me, I figured I'd better do it too."
16767,
16768,"I wore black because I liked it. I still do, and wearing it still means something to me. It's still my symbol of rebellion -- against a stagnant status quo, against our hypocritical houses of God, against people whose minds are closed to others' ideas."
16769,"The more I learn, the more excited I get."
16770,I don't give up because I don't give up. I don't believe in it.

16780,The concept of time shuts off eternity.
16781,Your sacred space is where you can find yourself again and again.

16788,"If the path before you is clear, you're probably on someone else's."
16789,
16790,"You are more than you think you are. There are dimensions of your being and a potential for realization and consciousness that are not included in your concept of yourself. Your life is much deeper and broader than you conceive it to be here. What you are living is but a fractional inkling of what is really within you, what gives you life, breadth, and depth."

If you can see it laid out in front of you, you can be sure it is someone else's path. That is why you see it so clearly."
16801,"What if we choose not to do the things we are supposed to do? The principal gain is a sense of an authentic act - and an authentic life. It may be a short one, but it is an authentic one, and that's a lot better than those short lives full of boredom. The principal loss is security. Another is respect from the community. But you gain the respect of another community, the one that is worth having the respect of."

16850,Get out there and do what you love!
16851,Set small goals along the way and don't be overwhelmed by the process.
16852,In the end I have to hold myself accountable...I had to make a change if I really wanted to reach the goals I had set for myself. I had to get out of being comfortable and get into a situation that was going to really push me.
16853,"I have a power word that I use-when I qualified for the Olympics in 2008, it was fighter. That way when I'm in the race and I get to those dark moments, I can think of the word and it evokes that emotion for me."
16854,
16855,It's all about loving your parents.
16856,"I am a product of Indian cinema; I've grown up watching Indian films ever since I can remember. And song and dance is part of our lives, it's part of our culture we wake up to songs, we sleep to lullabies, you know, we celebrate every religious and traditional function with music."

16864,"Legal documents have mistrust written all over them. It's unfortunate, but the human DNA is so tuned to kind of taking you for granted that we tend to protect ourselves legally.

16979,"Women is out because she's getting in her daily dose of empowerment, freedom and fearlessness. She has put on her freedom wings for 20 minutes or two hours.

16985,"I don't have any kids of my own, quite by choice. There are two reasons for that. One, I had a sense of obligation for what my life would be and a vision of how to get that accomplished and it didn't include children. It's not that I don't like them, it's just that if you have them, they deserve 100 per cent of your attention."
16986,"Jock Semple and I were at daggers drawn for five years, even though I kind of forgave him from the get-go. I knew he was an over-stressed race director, I knew he was protecting his race.

16987,"When I forgave Jock Semple on Heartbreak Hill, I also got really cross with women. I couldn't understand why they didn't get it, why they didn't know that running was so cool and why they weren't in the race as well. Then I thought to myself ""How stupid can you be? You've had so much encouragement and motivation and these women haven't."""
16988,"I forgave Jock Semple his action on Boston race just around the time I got to Heartbreak Hill. I had 24 miles to go and you cannot run 24 miles and stay angry. That's the truth. When we go out and we're mad at our boss or mad at the world, when we run, we get it out of our system."

Whatever the trial or temptation, it is not more than you can bear. It is bearable. It can be handled. You can know as Joseph knew, ""You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good in order to bring about this present result, to preserve many people alive"" (Genesis 50:20)."

If not, He is waiting - arms opened wide - for you."
17053,"Have we forgotten our calling? (2 Cor. 5:19-20) Remember that your first and foremost calling is to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ, and that gospel is a twofold message: His death for our sins and His resurrection for our lives."
17054,God is in control and therefore in everything I can give thanks.

The epidemic of walking away has hit our land with effects as devastating as the bubonic plague, and it has destroyed millions of effective lives and relationships. We are so self-centered that we have ceased to lay down our lives for others. We have seen others faint or walk away and we have followed in their weakness. We have fainted when we could have persevered by exchanging our strength for His! With His strength, not only could we have kept on walking, we could have run!"
17056,
17057,"By fully tuning in to the now moment in your life, you will discover that you always have enough to enjoy every moment of your life. The only reason you have not been happy every instant is that you have been dominating your consciousness with thoughts about something you don't have- or trying to hold on to something that you do have but which is no longer appropriate in the present flow of your life."

17074,"Lots of people look for happiness through sensations, whether it's through sex, the taste of food, the sound of music, the sensations of movies and plays, creating a certain environment in their home, and so on. Looking for happiness through sensations keeps you constantly searching for the next ""fix"" and for more varied sensations. Sensations become addictions, and nothing is ever enough."

17107,"Our anxiety does not come from thinking about the future, but from wanting to control it."
17108,Keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life.
17109,"Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. They come through you but not from you, and though they are with you, yet they belong not to you. You may give them your love, but not your thoughts. For they have their own thoughts. You may house their bodies but not their souls, for their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams. You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you. For life goes not backward, nor tarries with yesterday."

Someone to share with, who'll understand.
He made special people to see us through
The glad times and the sad times, too;
A person on whom we can always depend,
Someone we can call a friend.
God made friends so we'll carry a part
Of His perfect love in all our hearts."

17125,"All can hear, but only the sensitive can understand."
17126,"It is wrong to think that love comes from long companionship and persevering courtship. Love is the offspring of spiritual affinity and unless that affinity is created in a moment, it will not be created for years or even generations."

17136,"I'm not trying to influence anyone else; I'm not saying, ""Do what I do."" I think it's a little pretentious to say, ""I'm a role model""; I would never say that, and I don't think of myself that way."
17137,"If no tender words are spoken, no tender hearts can be broken."

17192,"There's a choice that we have to make as people, as individuals. If you want to be great at something, there's a choice you have to make. We all can be masters at our craft, but you have to make a choice. What I mean by that is, there are inherent sacrifices that come along with that. Family time, hanging out with friends, being a great friend, being a great son, nephew, whatever the case may be. There are sacrifices that come along with making that decision."

Your purpose is much bigger than that."

17226,"My refrigerator is powerful. In fact, it has a direct link to my overall well-being."
17227,"Do the things you used to talk about doing but never did. Know when to let go and when to hold on tight. Stop rushing. Don't be intimidated to say it like it is. Stop apologizing all the time. Learn to say no, so your yes has some oomph. Spend time with the friends who lift you up, and cut loose the ones who bring you down. Stop giving your power away. Be more concerned with being interested than being interesting. Be old enough to appreciate your freedom, and young enough to enjoy it. Finally know who you are."

17234,"I love the big fresh starts, the clean slates like birthdays and new years, but I also really like the idea that we can get up every morning and start over."
17235,"As I get older I see that running has changed for me. What used to be about burning calories is now more about burning up what is false. Lies I used to tell myself about who I was and what I could do, friendships that cannot withstand hills or miles, the approval I no longer need to seek, and solidarity that cannot bear silence. I run to burn up what I don't need and ignite what I do."
17236,"It's not only moving that creates new starting points. Sometimes all it takes is a subtle shift in perspective, an opening of the mind, an intentional pause and reset, or a new route to start to see new options and new possibilities."

17240,"Without running, I would have missed the joy of rain. What could be considered an inconvenience or a bummer to the inexperienced is actually a gift. Without running, I would miss a lot of things-like seeing cities in a certain way, or knowing certain people all the way to the core. I'm glad we don't experience life through glass, under cover, or from the sidelines. Good things take miles."

 you've got to become someone you've never been. I

 failures and disappointments , which take us to the 
 door of discovery and greatness."

17532,"The palace started as a single vaulted room and grew in proportion to my despair. It began as an exercise to keep my mind from its melancholy, then it became a dream and a necessity. . . . I built a temple in my head. . . . Its hallways were as lofty as a cathedral, and the arch of each window as supple as a bow. Its corridors were the passages of my own brain."
17533,"Fine food is poison. It can be as bitter as antimony and bitter almonds and as repulsive as swallowing live toads.

17561,
17562,"You don't love a woman because she is beautiful, but she is beautiful because you love her. Never underestimate the power of love. The way to love anything is to realize it may be lost.

There is pleasure in the pathless woods; there is a rapture on the lonely shore; There is society, where none intrudes, by the deep sea, and music in its roar."

17670,"We forget that we create the situations, then we give our power away by blaming the other person for our frustration.

When we create peace and harmony and balance in our mind, we will find it in our lives."

17718,Inflation is the fiscal complement of statism and arbitrary government. It is a cog in the complex of policies and institutions which gradually lead toward totalitarianism .
17719,Historical knowledge is indispensable for those who want to build a better world
17720,"Socialism is not in the least what it pretends to be. It is not the pioneer of a better and finer world, but the spoiler of what thousands of years of civilization have created. It does not build, it destroys. For destruction is the essence of it. It produces nothing, it only consumes what the social order based on private ownership in the means of production has created."
17721,"The Marxians love of democratic institutions was a stratagem only, a pious fraud for the deception of the masses. Within a socialist community there is no room left for freedom."
17722,"Government is the only institution that can take a valuable commodity like paper, and make it worthless by applying ink."
17723,The struggle for freedom is ultimately not resistance to autocrats or oligarchs but resistance to the despotism of public opinion.
17724,"The main propoganda trick of supporters of the allegedly ""progressive"" policy of government control is to blame capitalism for all that is unsatisfactory in present-day conditions and to extol the blessings of socialism.  They have never attempted to prove their fallacious dogmas, all they did was to call their adversaries names and cast suspicion upon their motives.  And, unfortunately, the average citizen cannot see through these stratagems.  The liars must be afraid of the truth and are therefore driven to suppress its pronouncement."
17725,Depressions and mass unemployment are not caused by the free market but by government interference in the economy.
17726,
17727,[E]conomic history is a long record of government policies that failed because they were designed with a bold disregard for the laws of economics
17728,"If one rejects laissez faire on account of mans fallibility and moral weakness, one must for the same reason also reject every kind of government action."
17729,Liberty is always freedom from the government.
17730,He who is unfit to serve his fellow citizens wants to rule them.
17731,"It is important to remember that government interference always means either violent action or the threat of such action. Government is in the last resort the employment of armed men, of policemen, gendarmes, soldiers, prison guards, and hangmen. The essential feature of government is the enforcement of its decrees by beating, killing, and imprisoning. Those who are asking for more government interference are asking ultimately for more compulsion and less freedom."
17732,"Every government intervention [in the marketplace] creates unintended consequences, which lead to calls for further government interventions."
17733,"Economic progress is the work of the savers, who accumulate capital, and of the entrepreneurs, who turn capital to new uses."
17734,
17735,
17736,"Happiness consists not in having much, but in wanting no more than you have."
17737,Prejudices of all kinds have their strongest holds in the minds of the vulgar and the ignorant.
17738,"So easy it is to see the errors of past ages, so difficult to acknowledge our own!"
17739,The boughs of no two trees ever have the same arrangement. Nature always produces individuals; She never produces classes.
17740,You find yourself refreshed in the presence of cheerful people. Why not make an honest effort to confer that pleasure on others? Half the battle is gained if you never allow yourself to say anything gloomy.
17741,"Every human being has, like Socrates, an attendant spirit; and wise are they who obey its signals. If it does not always tell us what to do, it always cautions us what not to do."
17742,"It is my  mission to help in the breaking down of classes, and to make all  men feel as if they were brethren of the same family, sharing the same rights, the same capabilities, and the same responsibilities. While my hand can hold a pen, I will use it to this end; and while my brain can earn a dollar, I will devote it to this end."
17743,"a great mind can attend to little things, but a little mind cannot attend to great things."
17744,"Love is the divine quality that everywhere produces and restores life. To each and every one of us, it gives the power of working miracles if we will."
17745,Work! work! that is my unfailing cure for all troubles.
17746,"I will work in my own way, according to the light that is in me."
17747,"They [slaves] have stabbed themselves for freedom-jumped into the waves for freedom-starved for freedom-fought like very tigers for freedom! But they have been hung, and burned, and shot-and their tyrants have been their historians!"
17748,The rarest attainment is to grow old happily and gracefully.
17749,It is impossible to exaggerate the evil work theology has done in the world.
17750,"To everything there is a bright side and a dark side; and I hold it to be unwise, unphilosophic, unkind to others, and unhealthy for one's own soul, to form the habit of looking on the dark side. Cheerfulness is to the spiritual atmosphere what sunshine is to the earthly landscape. I am resolved to cherish cheerfulness with might and main."
17751,The United States is a warning rather than an example to the world.
17752,Blessed indeed is the man who hears many gentle voices call him father.
17753,"The cure for all the ills and wrongs, the cares, the sorrows, and the crimes of humanity, all lie in the one word 'love'. It is the divine vitality that everywhere produces and restores life."
17754,"Make people happy and there will not be half the quarreling, or a tenth part of the wickedness there now is."
17755,"Flowers have spoken to me more than I can tell in written words. They are the hieroglyphics of angels, loved by all men for the beauty of their character, though few can decipher even fragments of their meaning."
17756,"If we really believed that those who are gone from us were as truly alive as ourselves, we could not invest the subject with such awful depth of gloom as we do. If we could imbue our children with distinct faith in immortality, we should never speak of people as dead, but passed into another world. We should speak of the body as a cast-off garment, which the wearer had outgrown; consecrated indeed by the beloved being that used it for a season, but of no value within itself."
17757,"our republican ideas cannot be consistently carried out while women are excluded from any share in the government. ... Any class of human beings to whom a position of perpetual subordination is assigned, however much they may be petted and flattered, must inevitably be dwarfed, morally and intellectually."
17758,We must not forget that all great revolutions and reformations would look mean and meagre if examined in detail as they occurred at the time.
17759,

17761,How to overcome that seemingly impossible issue... Pray more words about it than you speak.
17762,Don’t let people’s compliments go to your head and don’t let their criticisms go to your heart.
17763,Do not confuse the command to love with the disease to please.
17764,Life as a Christ follower will always be a learning process of depending less on our own strength and more on God's power.
17765,"Today, let's be determined to see blessings in the midst of things that seem like burdens."
17766,Big things are built one brick at a time. Victories are achieved one choice at a time. A life well lived is chosen one day at a time.
17767,"You've never gone too far that God can't redeem you, restore you, forgive you, and give you a second chance."
17768,There is power in simply speaking the name Jesus.
17769,"No matter your age, stage of life, or circumstances, don't forget to dare to dream with God. You don't have to figure anything out. Just keep saying yes to Him, in big ways and small, and watch what He does."
17770,"When God says no, we are sometimes tempted to wonder if He loves us. In reality, it’s because He loves us, He sometimes says no."
17771,"Tonight, no matter what you're going through... backtrack and remember all the places where God has been so faithful before in your life. And know. Know with assurance. And boldness. And confidence. He is the same faithful God."
17772,Not making a decision is actually a decision. It's the decision to stay the same.
17773,Just because something is hard doesn’t mean it’s impossible.
17774,This life is not about me. It's about joining hands with Jesus to fulfill whatever tasks He sets before me and to share His love with all He brings my way.
17775,Having faith doesn't mean I have all the answers. It means trusting God especially in the midst of uncertainty.
17776,A woman who is careful with her words is a gift to all who know her.
17777,"Remember, the Devil loves to make us focus on the little that's wrong so we miss the big picture of all that's right."
17778,The secret to healthy conflict resolution isn't taking a 'you against me' stance. The secret is realizing it's 'us against Satan.' He's the real enemy.
17779,"Most of us spend years chasing things in this world that we think will make us feel loved. But everything this world has to offer is temporary. Everything. The kind of love our souls crave is lasting, eternal. And only God can fill up our hearts with that kind of love."
17780,Scars are beautiful when we see them as glorious reminders that we courageously survived.
17781,God is mighty. God is caring. God is worthy of praise. God is loving. God is able. God is in control. Nothing takes God by surprise. Some sweet reminders to soak in before falling asleep tonight.
17782,God will always do great things with people who are willing to be faithful in the small things.
17783,Forgiveness is mandatory; reconciliation is optional.
17784,
17785,"Carefully watch your thoughts, for they become your words. Manage and watch your words, for they will become your actions. Consider and judge your actions, for they have become your habits. Acknowledge and watch your habits, for they shall become your values. Understand and embrace your values, for they become your destiny."
17786,
17787,Our greatest ability as humans is not to change the world; but to change ourselves.
17788,"Many people, especially ignorant people, want to punish you for speaking the truth, for being correct, for being you. Never apologize for being correct, or for being years ahead of your time. If you’re right and you know it, speak your mind. Speak your mind. Even if you are a minority of one, the truth is still the truth."
17789,
17790,All good thoughts and ideas mean nothing without action
17791,it's easy to stand in the crowd but it takes courage to stand alone
17792,Keep your thoughts positive because your thoughts become your words. Keep your words positive because your words become your behavior. Keep your behavior positive because your behavior becomes your habits. Keep your habits positive because your habits become your values. Keep your values positive because your values become your destiny.
17793,You never know where your actions will lead to. But if you don't do anything they will lead you nowhere.
17794,"Conquer the heart of the enemy with truth and love, not by violence."
17795,"If you want to change the world, start with yourself."
17796,"Vaccination is a barbarous practice and one of the most fatal of all the delusions current in our time. Conscientious objectors to vaccination should stand alone, if need be, against the whole world, in defense of their conviction."
17797,Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.
17798,"In doing something, do it with love or never do it at all."
17799,To lose patience is to lose the battle.
17800,A customer is the most important visitor on our premises. He is not dependent on us. We are dependent on him. He is not an interruption in our work. He is the purpose of it. He is not an outsider in our business. He is part of it. We are not doing him a favor by serving him. He is doing us a favor by giving us an opportunity to do so.
17801,"When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won. There have been tyrants and murderers and for a time they seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall... think of it, always."
17802,The golden rule is to act fearlessly upon what one believes to be right.
17803,"Begin your day with prayer, and make it so soulful that it may remain with you until the evening."
17804,"People say true friends must always hold hands, but true friends don't need to hold hands because they know the other hand will always be there."
17805,"The world is big enough to satisfy everyones needs, but will always be too small to satisfy everyones greed"
17806,It's not too late at all. You just don't yet know what you are capable of.
17807,The simplest acts of kindness are by far more powerful then a thousand heads bowing in prayer.
17808,Peace is the most powerful weapon of mankind.
17809,
17810,
17811,"The media's the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent, and that's power. Because they control the minds of the masses."
17812,"One of the first things I think young people, especially nowadays, should learn is how to see for yourself and listen for yourself and think for yourself. Then you can come to an intelligent decision for yourself. If you form the habit of going by what you hear others say about someone, or going by what others think about someone, instead of searching that thing out for yourself and seeing for yourself, you will be walking west when you think you're going east, and you will be walking east when you think you're going west."

17818,"When the people who are in power want to use again, create an image, to justify something that's bad, they use the press. And they'll use the press to create a humanitarian image, for a devil, or a devil image for a humanitarian. They'll take a person who's a victim of the crime, and make it appear he's the criminal, and they'll take the criminal and make it appear that he's the victim of the crime."

17824,"I have more respect for a man who lets me know where he stands, even if he's wrong, than the one who comes up like an angel and is nothing but a devil."
17825,"When you live in a poor neighborhood, you are living in an area where you have poor schools. When you have poor schools, you have poor teachers. When you have poor teachers, you get a poor education. When you get a poor education, you can only work in a poor-paying job. And that poor-paying job enables you to live again in a poor neighborhood. So, it's a very vicious cycle."
17826,"We won't organize any black man to be a Democrat or a Republican because both of them have sold us out. Both of them have sold us out; both parties have sold us out. Both parties are racist, and the Democratic Party is more racist than the Republican Party."
17827,"Learn to see, listen, and think for yourself."
17828,"When you hear me say ""by any means necessary,"" I mean exactly that. I believe in anything that is necessary to correct unjust conditions-political, economic, social, physical, anything that is necessary."
17829,Only a fool would let his enemy teach his children.
17830,You can't separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom.
17831,"You're living at a time of extremism, a time of revolution 
 A time where there's got to be a change. People in power have misused it 
 And now there has to be a change and a better world has to be built 
 And the only way is going to be built is with extreme methods 
 And I for one will join with anyone, don't care what color you are 
 As long as you want change this miserable condition that exists on this earth"

17842,"Think of all the years passed by in which you said to yourself ""I'll do it tomorrow,"" and how the gods have again and again granted you periods of grace of which you have not availed yourself. It is time to realize that you are a member of the Universe, that you are born of Nature itself, and to know that a limit has been set to your time. Use every moment wisely, to perceive your inner refulgence, or 'twill be gone and nevermore within your reach."
17843,
17844,Do not be wise in words - be wise in deeds.
17845,"Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones."
17846,You always own the option of having no opinion. There is never any need to get worked up or to trouble your soul about things you can't control. These things are not asking to be judged by you. Leave them alone.

17850,"Say to yourself in the early morning: I shall meet today ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men.

You will learn that your spirit is bigger than your circumstances, as soon as you put your spirit first."
17872,"Every bird that sings, sings for you. Every breeze that blows, blows for you. Every sunray shines for you. If you only knew how loved you are."
17873,"In every moment we make a decision -- whether conscious or unconscious. Will I choose to open my heart, send love, withhold judgment and thus free myself from fear? Or will I close my heart, project fear instead of extending love, judge others, and thus bind myself to fear? The choice is mine and mine alone."
17874,"Happiness is the choice I make today. It does not rest on my circumstances, but on my frame of mind...In cultivating the habits of happiness, I attract the people and situations that match its frequency. I smile more often, give praise more often, give thanks more often, and am glad more often. For such is my choice today."
17875,"To the ego mind, surrender means giving up. To the spiritual mind, surrender means giving in and receiving."
17876,We don't reach the light through endless analysis of the dark. We reach the light by choosing the light.
17877,"The choice to follow love through to its completion is the choice to seek completion within ourselves. The point at which we shut down on others is the point at which we shut down on life. We heal as we heal others, and we heal others by extending our perceptions past their weaknesses. Until we have seen someone’s darkness, we don’t really know who that person is. Until we have forgiven someone’s darkness, we don’t really know what love is. Forgiving others is the only way to forgive ourselves, and forgiveness is our greatest need."

17895,"A woman is often measured by the things she cannot control. She is measured by the way her body curves or doesn't curve, by where she is flat or straight or round. She is measured by 36-24-36 and inches and ages and numbers, by all the outside things that don’t ever add up to who she is on the inside. And so if a woman is to be measured, let her be measured by the things she can control, by who she is and who she is trying to become. Because as every woman knows, measurements are only statistics... and STATISTICS LIE."
17896,
17897,"Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie?

17926,Don't wrestle with pigs. You both get dirty and the pig likes it.
17927,It's better to be an optimist who is sometimes wrong than a pessimist who is always right
17928,"The average woman would rather have beauty than brains, because the average man can see better than he can think."

It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. It turns problems into gifts, failures into successes, the unexpected into perfect timing, and mistakes into important events.

18153,There is nothing more important to this nation's future than investing in our young people.
18154,We have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be.
18155,We need to do a better job of putting ourselves higher on our own 'to do' list.
18156,I was too worried about the grades and I should have been more worried about learning.
18157,"Don't let anyone speak for you, and don't rely on others to fight for you."
18158,Be passionate about something and lean to that strength.
18159,
18160,"When a man spends his own money to buy something for himself, he is very careful about how much he spends and how he spends it. When a man spends his own money to buy something for someone else, he is still very careful about how much he spends, but somewhat less what he spends it on. When a man spends someone else's money to buy something for himself, he is very careful about what he buys, but doesn't care at all how much he spends. And when a man spends someone else's money on someone else, he does't care how much he spends or what he spends it on. And that's government for you."
18161,
18162,One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results.
18163,
18164,"Government has three primary functions. It should provide for military defense of the nation. It should enforce contracts between individuals. It should protect citizens from crimes against themselves or their property. When government-- in pursuit of good intentions tries to rearrange the economy, legislate morality, or help special interests, the cost come in inefficiency, lack of motivation, and loss of freedom. Government should be a referee, not an active player."
18165,"If you pay people not to work and tax them when they do, don't be surprised if you get unemployment."
18166,Inflation is the one form of taxation that can be imposed without legislation.
18167,The only corporate social responsibility a company has is to maximize its profits.
18168,
18169,"Why have we had such a decline in moral climate? I submit to you that a major factor has been a change in the philosophy which has been dominant, a change from belief in individual responsibility to belief in social responsibility. If you adopt the view that a man is not responsible for his own behavior, that somehow society is responsible, why should he seek to make his behavior good?"
18170,You cannot be sure that you are right unless you understand the arguments against your views better than your opponents do.
18171,"When you start paying people to be poor, you wind up with an awful lot of poor people."
18172,Many people want the government to protect the consumer. A much more urgent problem is to protect the consumer from the government.
18173,"A society that puts equality — in the sense of equality of outcome — ahead of freedom will end up with neither equality nor freedom. The use of force to achieve equality will destroy freedom, and the force, introduced for good purposes, will end up in the hands of people who use it to promote their own interests."
18174,"Because we live in a largely free society, we tend to forget how limited is the span of time and the part of the globe for which there has ever been anything like political freedom: the typical state of mankind is tyranny, servitude, and misery."
18175,"The word 'free' is used three times in the Declaration of Independence and once in the First Amendment to the Constitution, along with 'freedom.' The word 'fair' is not used in either of our founding documents."
18176,The Federal Reserve the privately owned U.S. central bank definitely caused The Great Depression by contracting the amount of currency in circulation by one third from 1929 to 1933.
18177,The great virtue of a free market system is that it does not care what color people are; it does not care what their religion is; it only cares whether they can produce something you want to buy. It is the most effective system we have discovered to enable people who hate one another to deal with one another and help one another.
18178,Nobody spends somebody else's money as carefully as he spends his own.
18179,The power to do good is also the power to do harm.
18180,The most important single central fact about a free market is that no exchange takes place unless both parties benefit.
18181,"Every economist knows that minimum wages either do nothing or cause inflation and unemployment. That's not a statement, it's a definition."
18182,You cannot simultaneously have free immigration and a welfare state.
18183,Higher taxes never reduce the deficit. Governments spend whatever they take in and then whatever they can get away with.
18184,
18185,"The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning."
18186,Nothing haunts us like the things we don't say.
18187,What you have done to this point cannot be undone. What you do next... It is still unwritten.
18188,"When someone is in your heart, they're never truly gone. They can come back to you, even at unlikely times."
18189,Accept who you are; and revel in it.
18190,All endings are also beginnings. We just don't know it at the time.
18191,There are two stories for every life; the one you live & the one others tell
18192,"Parents rarely let go of their children, so children let go of them. They move on. They move away. The moments that used to define them - a mother's approval, a father's nod - are covered by moments of their own accomplishments. It is not until much later, as the skin sags and the heart weakens, that children understand; their stories, and all their accomplishments, sit atop the stories of their mothers and fathers, stones upon stones, beneath the waters of their lives."
18193,"This is part of what a family is about, not just love. It's knowing that your family will be there watching out for you. Nothing else will give you that. Not money. Not fame. Not work."
18194,We need to forgive ourselves. For all the things we didn't do. All the things we should have done. You can't get stuck on the regrets of what should have happened.
18195,There is no such thing as 'too late' in life.
18196,"Lost love is still love. It takes a different form, that's all. You can't see their smile or bring them food or tousle their hair or move them around a dance floor. But when those senses weaken another heightens. Memory. Memory becomes your partner. You nurture it. You hold it. You dance with it."
18197,Mankind is connected in ways it does not understand - even in dreams.
18198,You can find something truly important in an ordinary minute.
18199,"Fear is how you lose your life...a little bit at a time...What we give to fear, we take away from...faith."
18200,"But there's a story behind everything. How a picture got on a wall. How a scar got on your face. Sometimes the stories are simple, and sometimes they are hard and heartbreaking. But behind all your stories is always your mother's story, because hers is where yours begin."
18201,"Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself."
18202,"...if you're trying to show off for people at the top, forget it. They will look down on you anyhow. And if you're trying to show off for people at the bottom, forget it. They will only envy you. Status will get you nowhere. Only an open heart will allow you to float equally between everyone."
18203,"Accept what you are able to do and what you are not able to do. Accept the past as past, without denying it or discarding it. Learn to forgive yourself and to forgive others. Don't assume that it's too late to get involved."
18204,Don't cling to things because everything is impermanent.
18205,The secret to happiness...be satisfied and be grateful.
18206,"Life is a series of pulls back and forth. You want to do one thing, but you are bound to do something else."
18207,"Each affects the other, and the other affects the next, and the world is full of stories, but the stories are all one."
18208,"When you look into your mother’s eyes, you know that is the purest love you can find on this earth."
18209,"If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives: Be kind anyway. If you are successful you will win some false friends and true enemies: Succeed anyway. If you are honest and frank people will try to cheat you: Be honest anyway. What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight: Build anyway. If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous of you: Be happy anyway. The good you do today, will often be forgotten by tomorrow: Do good anyway. Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough: Give your best anyway."
18210,
18211,Small things done with great love will change the world.
18212,
18213,"The good you do today may be forgotten tomorrow. Do good anyway. Give the world the best you have and it may never be enough. Give your best anyway. For you see, in the end, it is between you and God. It was never between you and them anyway."
18214,"Life is an opportunity, benefit from it. Life is beauty, admire it. Life is a dream, realize it. Life is a challenge, meet it. Life is a duty, complete it. Life is a game, play it. Life is a promise, fulfill it. Life is sorrow, overcome it. Life is a song, sing it. Life is a struggle, accept it. Life is a tragedy, confront it. Life is an adventure, dare it. Life is luck, make it. Life is too precious, do not destroy it. Life is life, fight for it."
18215,"I can do things you cannot, you can do things I cannot; together we can do great things."
18216,"I used to believe that prayer changes things, but now I know that prayer changes us, and we change things."
18217,
18218,"At the end of life we will not be judged by how many diplomas we have received, how much money we have made, how many great things we have done. We will be judged by ""I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat, I was naked and you clothed me. I was homeless, and you took me in."
18219,
18220,"If you want to change the world, go home and love your family."
18221,
18222,"Prayer is not asking. Prayer is putting oneself in the hands of God, at His disposition, and listening to His voice in the depth of our hearts."
18223,Go out into the world today and love the people you meet. Let your presence light new light in the hearts of people.
18224,I don't do great things. I do small things with great love.
18225,"Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless."
18226,There is no key to happiness; the door is always open
18227,What we sometimes consider a stumbling block is rather a rock we can step on.
18228,Helping hands are better than Praying Lips
18229,"God didn't call me to be successful, He called me to be faithful."
18230,Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier.
18231,"God doesn't require us to succeed, he only requires that you try."
18232,"If you judge people, you have no time to love them."
18233,"I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples."
18234,
18235,"It is better to sit alone than in company with the bad, and it is better still to sit with the good than alone. It is better to speak to a seeker of knowledge than to remain silent, but silence is better than idle words."
18236,"Conduct yourself in this world as if you are here to stay forever, and yet prepare for eternity as if you are to die tomorrow."
18237,Even a smile can be charity.
18238,Say the truth even if it may be bitter.
18239,The greatest of wealth is the richness of the soul.
18240,Wisdom and power follow endurance and patience.
18241,Happy are those who find fault with themselves instead of finding fault with others.
18242,You will not enter paradise until you have faith. And you will not complete your faith until you love one another.
18243,"Do not tell me how educated you are. Tell me how much you have traveled, and I will know how educated you are."
18244,The best jihad is to speak a word of justice to an oppressive ruler.
18245,Patience is the key to content.
18246,"If you do not feel ashamed of anything, then you can do whatever you like"
18247,
18248,Strive always to excel in virtue and truth.
18249,More harm is done by fools through foolishness than is done by evil-doers through wickedness.
18250,"When something weighs on your conscience, give it up."
18251,Do you love your creator Love your fellow-beings first.
18252,Contemplation for an hour is better than formal worship for sixty years.
18253,"Riches does not mean, having a great amount of property, but riches is self-contentment."
18254,"Religion is very easy and whoever overburdens himself in his religion will not be able to continue in that way. So you should not be extremists, but try to be near to perfection and receive the good tidings that you will be rewarded; and gain strength by worshipping in the mornings, the nights."
18255,Love for one's country is part of faith.
18256,"If anyone travels on a road in search of knowledge, Allah will cause him to travel on one of the roads of Paradise."
18257,"Do not think little of any good deed, even if it is just greeting your brother with a smile."
18258,"Speak to people according to the development of their consciousness, for if you speak all things to all people, some cannot understand you and so fall into errors!"
18259,
18260,"I'll tell you how I'd like to be remembered: As a black man who won the heavyweight title - Who has humorous and who never looked down on those who looked up to him - A man who stood for freedom, justice and equality - And I wouldn't even mind if folks forgot how pretty I was."
18261,Even the greatest was once a beginner. Don't be afraid to take that first step.
18262,
18263,Success is not achieved by winning all the time. Real success comes when we rise after we fall. Some mountains are higher than others. Some roads steeper than the next. There are hardships and setbacks but you cannot let them stop you. Even on the steepest road you must not turn back.
18264,"We all have the same God, we just serve him differently. Rivers, lakes, ponds, streams, oceans all have different names, but they all contain water. So do religions have different names, and they all contain truth, expressed in different ways forms and times. It doesn't matter whether you're a Muslim, a Christian, or a Jew. When you believe in God, you should believe that all people are part of one family. If you love God, you can't love only some of his children."
18265,
18266,
18267,True success is reaching our potential without compromising our values.
18268,
18269,Impossible is not a fact. It's an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It's a dare. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing
18270,Just remember that you don't have to be what they want you to be.
18271,"Rest but never quit. Even the sun has a sinking spell each evening. But it always rises the next morning. At sunrise, every soul is born again."
18272,"If you look at the world the same way when you're 50 that you did when you were 20, then you wasted 30 years."
18273,
18274,"When you're right, nobody remembers. When you're wrong, nobody forgets."
18275,We can't be brave without fear.
18276,Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth.
18277,"I am grateful for all my victories, but I am especially grateful for my losses, because they only made me work harder."
18278,Success is not achieved by winning all the time. Real success comes when we rise after we fall.
18279,"Every day is different, and some days are better than others, but no matter how challenging the day, I get up and live it."
18280,What counts in the ring is what you can do after you're exhausted. The same is true of life.
18281,"You're not going to enjoy every minute of the journey, but the success you'll find at the end will make it all worth it."
18282,"If we continue to think and live as if we belong only to different cultures and different religions, with separate missions and goals, we will always be in self-defeating competition with each other. Once we realize we are all members of humanity, we will want to compete in the spirit of love."
18283,There comes a time in every person's life when he has to choose the course his life will take.
18284,
18285,"Jesus doesn't give an explanation for the pain and sorrow of the world. He comes where the pain is most acute and takes it upon himself. Jesus doesn't explain why there is suffering, illness, and death in the world. He brings healing and hope. He doesn't allow the problem of evil to be the subject of a seminar. He allows evil to do its worst to him. He exhausts it, drains its power, and emerges with new life."
18286,Our culture is so fixated on dying and going to heaven when the whole Scripture is about heaven coming to earth.
18287,"Our task as image-bearing, God-loving, Christ-shaped, Spirit-filled Christians, following Christ and shaping our world, is to announce redemption to a world that has discovered its fallenness, to announce healing to a world that has discovered its brokenness, to proclaim love and trust to a world that knows only exploitation, fear and suspicion."
18288,It's not great faith you need; it is faith in a great God.
18289,"Jesus's resurrection is the beginning of God's new project not to snatch people away from earth to heaven but to colonize earth with the life of heaven. That, after all, is what the Lord's Prayer is about."
18290,People often get upset when you teach them what is in the Bible rather than what they presume is in the Bible.
18291,Worship is love on its knees before the beloved; just as mission is love on its feet to serve the beloved
18292,"You become like what you worship. When you gaze in awe, admiration, and wonder at something or someone, you begin to take on something of the character of the object of your worship."
18293,"What you do in the present—by painting, preaching, singing, sewing, praying, teaching, building hospitals, digging wells, campaigning for justice, writing poems, caring for the needy, loving your neighbor as yourself—will last into God’s future. These activities are not simply ways of making the present life a little less beastly, a little more bearable, until the day when we leave it behind altogether. They are part of what we may call building for God’s kingdom."
18294,"Tolerance is a cheap, low-grade parody of love. Tolerance is not a great virtue to aspire to. Love is much tougher and harder."
18295,"The cross is the surest, truest and deepest window on the very heart and character of the living and loving God."
18296,"The church exists primarily for two closely correlated purposes: to worship God and to work for his kingdom in the world ... The church also exists for a third purpose, which serves the other two: to encourage one another, to build one another up in faith, to pray with and for one another, to learn from one another and teach one another, and to set one another examples to follow, challenges to take up, and urgent tasks to perform. This is all part of what is known loosely as fellowship."
18297,"Made for spirituality, we wallow in introspection. Made for joy, we settle for pleasure. Made for justice, we clamor for vengeance. Made for relationship, we insist on our own way. Made for beauty, we are satisfied with sentiment. But new creation has already begun. The sun has begun to rise. Christians are called to leave behind, in the tomb of Jesus Christ, all that belongs to the brokenness and incompleteness of the present world ... That, quite simply, is what it means to be Christian: to follow Jesus Christ into the new world, God's new world, which he has thrown open before us."
18298,"Wherever St. Paul went, there was a riot. Wherever I go, they serve tea."
18299,"If you have never felt or known the sheer power and strength of God's love, take another look at Jesus dying on the cross."
18300,"Love is not just tolerance. It's not just distant appreciation. It's a warm sense of, 'I am enjoying the fact that you are you.'"
18301,"True worship is open to God, adoring God, waiting for God, trusting God even in the dark."
18302,"The closer you get to the truth, the clearer becomes the beauty, and the more you will find worship welling up within you. That's why theology and worship belong together."
18303,"The whole point of the kingdom of God is Jesus has come to bear witness to the true truth, which is nonviolent. When God wants to take charge of the world, he doesn't send in the tanks. He sends in the poor and the meek."
18304,The message of Easter is that God's new world has been unveiled in Jesus Christ and that you're now invited to belong to it.
18305,"God's plan is not to abandon this world, the world which he said was ""very good."" Rather, he intends to remake it. And when he does he will raise all his people to new bodily life to live in it. That is the promise of the Christian gospel."
18306,"True worship doesn't put on a show or make a fuss; true worship isn't forced, isn't half-hearted, doesn't keep looking at its watch, doesn't worry what the person in the next pew is doing. True worship is open to God, adoring God, waiting for God, trusting God even in the dark."
18307,"Hope, for the Christian, is not wishful thinking or mere blind optimism. It is a mode of knowing, a mode within which new things are possible, options are not shut down, new creation can happen."
18308,"The cross is the place where, and the means by which, God loved us to the uttermost."
18309,
18310,Victory is not always winning the battle...but rising every time you fall.
18311,Un croquis vaut mieux qu
18312,The reason most people fail instead of succeed is they trade what they want most for what they want at the moment.
18313,It is not necessary to bury the truth. It is sufficient merely to delay it until nobody cares.
18314,Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.
18315,"The World is not ruined by the wickedness of the wicked, but by the weakness of the good."
18316,You don't reason with intellectuals. You shoot them.
18317,Courage isn't having the strength to go on - it is going on when you don't have strength.
18318,
18319,"Until you spread your wings, you'll have no idea how far you can fly."
18320,The only way to lead people is to show them a future: a leader is a dealer in hope.
18321,The best way to make every one poor is to insist on equality of wealth.
18322,God is on the side with the best artillery
18323,Impossible is the word found only in a fool's dictionary. Wise people create opportunities for themselves and make everything possible.
18324,The purpose of religion is to keep the poor from killing the rich.
18325,"Once you have made up your mind, stick to it; there is no longer any 'if' or 'but'."
18326,The surest way to remain poor is to be an honest man.
18327,Envy is a declaration of inferiority.
18328,"Strategy is the art of making use of time and space. I am less concerned about the later than the former. Space we can recover, lost time never."
18329,"Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne, and I have founded empires. But on what did we rest the creations of our genius? Upon force. Jesus Christ founded his empire upon love; and at this hour millions of men would die for him."
18330,"There is only one thing in this world, and that is to keep acquiring money and more money, power and more power. All the rest is meaningless."
18331,You become strong by defying defeat and by turning loss into gain and failure to success.
18332,"Six hours' sleep for a man, seven for a woman, and eight for a fool."
18333,"Impatience is a great obstacle to success; he who treats everything with brusqueness gathers nothing, or only immature fruit which will never ripen."
18334,
18335,"Discipline comes through self control. This means that you must control all negative qualities. Before you can control conditions, you must first control yourself. Self-mastery is the hardest job you will ever tackle. If you do not conquer self, you will be conquered by self."
18336,"Time is wealth, and unlike money when it is gone you cannot replace it."
18337,Failure cannot cope with persistence.
18338,"Truly, “thoughts are things,” and powerful things at that, when they are mixed with definiteness of purpose, persistence, and a burning desire for their translation into riches, or other material objects."
18339,"Your mental attitude gives your entire personality a drawing power that attracts the circumstances, things and people you think about most!"
18340,Behind every adversity - is an opportunity!
18341,No one ever is defeated until defeat has been accepted as a reality.
18342,"The primary reason for failure is that people do not develop new 
 plans to replace those plans that didn't work."
18343,Persistence is nothing more than Concentrated Effort mixed with Determination and Faith.
18344,
18345,"Fear is a habit, so is self pity, defeat, anxiety, despair, hopelessness and resignation. You can eliminate all of these negative habits with two simple resolves: I can and I will."
18346,"A state of mind is something that one assumes. It cannot be purchased, it must be created."
18347,
18348,"You have absolute control over just one thing, your thoughts.  This divine gift is the sole means by which you may control your destiny.  If you fail to control your mind, you will control nothing else."
18349,"Anything you do to and for another person, you do it to and for yourself"
18350,A goal is a dream with a deadline.
18351,
18352,Our only limitations are those we set up in our own minds
18353,"Cherish your visions and your dreams, as they are the children of your soul; the blueprints of your ultimate achievements."
18354,The man of decision cannot be stopped! The man of indecision cannot be started! Take your own choice.
18355,"Live each day as if it were your last, and you’ll develop a keen respect for opportunity."
18356,"The number one reason people fail in life is because they listen to their friends, family, and neighbors."
18357,A positive mind finds a way it can be done; a negative mind looks for all the ways it can't be done.
18358,"Anything acquired without effort, and without cost is generally unappreciated."
18359,
18360,"God does not begin by asking us about our ability, but only about our availability, and if we then prove our dependability, he will increase our capability."
18361,"In conclusion, the submission of one's will is really the only uniquely personal thing we have to place on God's altar. The many other things we 'give,' brothers and sisters, are actually the things He has already given or loaned to us. However, when you and I finally submit ourselves, by letting our individual wills be swallowed up in God's will, then we are really giving something to Him! It is the only possession which is truly ours to give!"
18362,"If, in the end, you have not chosen Jesus Christ it will not matter what you have chosen."
18363,"I fear that, as conditions worsen, many will react to the failures of too much government by calling for even more government. Then there will be more and more lifeboats launched because fewer and fewer citizens know how to swim. Unlike some pendulums, political pendulums to not swing back automatically; they must be pushed. History is full of instances when people have waited in vain for pendulums to swing back."
18364,"No ""natural"" resource is more precious and to be used more wisely than time.  These mortal moments matter more than we know.  There are no idle hours; there are only idle people. In true righteousness there is serenity, but there is an array of reminders that the ""sacred present"" is packed with possibilities which are slipping by us, which are going away from us each moment."
18365,"The more seriously we work on our own imperfections, the less we are judgemental of the imperfections of others."
18366,The soul is like a violin string: it makes music only when it is stretched.
18367,The acceptance of the reality that we are in the Lord's loving hands is only a recognition that we have never really been anywhere else.
18368,"Trials and tribulations tend to squeeze the artificiality out of us, leaving the essence of what we really are and clarifying what we really yearn for."
18369,"It is our job to lift others up, not to size them up."
18370,"Men's and nations' finest hour consist of those moments when extraordinary challenge is met by extraordinary response. Hence in those darkest hours, we must light our individual candles rather than vying with others to call attention to the enveloping darkness. Our indignation about injustice should lead to illumination, for if it does not, we are only adding to the despair-and the moment of gravest danger is when there is so little light that darkness seems normal!"
18371,"Patience is tied very closely to faith in our Heavenly Father. Actually, when we are unduly impatient, we are suggesting that we know what is best—better than does God. Or, at least, we are asserting that our timetable is better than His. We can grow in faith only if we are willing to wait patiently for God's purposes and patterns to unfold in our lives, on His timetable."
18372,"Time is clearly not our natural dimension. Thus it is that we are never really at home in time. Alternately, we find ourselves wishing to hasten the passage of time or to hold back the dawn. We can do neither, of course, but whereas the fish is at home in water, we are clearly not at home in time--because we belong to eternity."
18373,"During our mortal schooling in submissiveness, we will see the visible crosses that some carry, but other crosses will go unseen.  A few individuals may appear to have no trials at all, which, if it were so, would be a trial in itself.  Indeed, if, as do trees, our souls had rings to measure the years of greatest personal growth, the wide rings would likely reflect the years of greatest moisture-but from tears, not rainfall."
18374,We cannot lead or draw others to Christ unless we stand closer to Him than they do.
18375,A society which permits anything will eventually lose everything.
18376,"Long ago when a child lay in a manger, a special star appeared. It didn't just show up that evening. It had to have been placed in its orbit centuries before in a trajectory that would make it appear at that special moment of time to announce the birth of a special child. Just as there is divine design in the universe, so each of us has been placed in our own orbits in this life to love, to serve, to help light the world."
18377,"The winds of tribulation, which blow out some men's candles of commitment, only fan the fires of faith of others."
18378,"If we are serious about our discipleship, Jesus will eventually request each of us to do those very things which are most difficult for us to do."
18379,The great challenge is to refuse to let the bad things that happen to us do bad things to us. That is the crucial difference between adversity and tragedy.
18380,"God will facilitate, but He will not force."
18381,"When we are unduly impatient with an omniscient God's timing, we really are suggesting that we know what's best. Strange isn't it-we who wear wrist watches seek to counsel Him who oversees cosmic clocks and calendars."
18382,Sometimes the best people... have the worst experiences... because they are ready to learn
18383,"To be cheerful when others are in despair, to keep the faith when others falter, to be true even when we feel forsaken—all of these are deeply desired outcomes during the deliberate, divine tutorials which God gives to us—because He loves us. These learning experiences must not be misread as divine indifference. Instead, such tutorials are a part of the divine unfolding."
18384,
18385,"If you don't go within, you go without."
18386,"If you believe the noises of the world, rather than the silences of your soul, you will be lost."
18387,"Remember always, you are the gift!"
18388,"You think of yourselves as humans searching for a spiritual awakening, when in fact you are spiritual beings attempting to cope with a human awakening. Seeing yourselves from the perspective of the spirit within will help you to remember why you came here and what you came here to do."
18389,"Life is a creation, not a discovery."
18390,The way to move out of judgement is to move into gratitude
18391,"Enlightenment is understanding that there is nowhere to go, nothing to do, and nobody you have to be except exactly who you're being right now."
18392,"Good health is not the absence of symptoms, it is the presence of peace."
18393,"Obstacles are not opposing you, but merely and gently re-routing you. It is important not to view that which stands in your way as your 'enemy.' It can often be your best friend, sending you on a detour that takes you around what would have been your biggest stumbling block."
18394,"Your light is seen, your heart is known, your soul is cherished by more people than you might imagine. If you knew how many others have been touched in wonderful ways by you, you would be astonished. If you knew how many people feel so much for you, you would be shocked. You are far more wonderful than you think you are. Rest with that. Rest easy with that. Breathe again. You are doing fine. More than fine. Better than fine. You’re doin’ great. So relax. And love yourself today."
18395,Do not limit the shape and size in which your miracle can come. Sometimes the smallest keys turn the biggest locks.
18396,"So long as you are still worried about what others think of you, you are owned by them. Only when you require no approval from outside yourself can you own yourself."
18397,The universe is just a big Xerox machine. It simply produces copies of your thoughts.
18398,"Fear is energy which contracts, closes down, draws in, runs, hides, hoards, harms. Love is the energy which expands, opens up, sends out, stays, reveals, shares, HEALS."
18399,"What you resist, persists"
18400,Seek to create change in your life not because something is 'wrong' ? but because it no longer makes an accurate statement of 'who you are'.
18401,"Happiness and joy comes to you when it moves through you. There is no other pathway--and that's the miracle. You will have a number of opportunities in the days just ahead to be a vehicle of happiness and joy for another. Step right into that. Be the source of that. As you bring others to a smile, so, too, will you bring yourself. The method is foolproof."
18402,The biggest commitment you must keep is your commitment to yourself.
18403,"Healing is the process of accepting all, then choosing best."
18404,"Until you decide what something means, it has no meaning at all. You determine what something means."
18405,True vision is the ability to see in another more than they are showing you.
18406,"Nothing happens in life by accident. Nothing occurs by chance. Nothing takes place without producing the opportunity for real and lasting benefit to you. The perfection of every moment may not be apparent to you, yet that will make the moment no less perfect."
18407,There is a divine purpose behind everything - and therefore a divine presence in everything.
18408,A thing is only right or wrong because you say it is. A thing is not right or wrong intrinsically.
18409,
18410,Shoot for the stars but if you happen to miss shoot for the moon instead.
18411,It's a great thing for a man to walk on the moon. But it's a greater thing for God to walk on the earth.
18412,
18413,
18414,I believe that every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine running around doing exercises.
18415,You've got to expect things are going to go wrong. And we always need to prepare ourselves for handling the unexpected.
18416,"The single observation I would offer for your consideration is that some things are beyond your control. You can lose your health to illness or accident. You can lose your wealth to all manner of unpredictable sources. What are not easily stolen from you without your cooperation are your principles and your values. They are your most important possessions and, if carefully selected and nurtured, will well serve you and your fellow man."
18417,"Good luck, Mr. Gorsky!"
18418,Man must understand his universe in order to understand his destiny.
18419,Opportunities will be available to you that you cannot imagine.
18420,"A picture does a great job, but it's not nearly like being there."
18421,"If you don't know who you are, a university is an expensive place to find out."
18422,There are places to go beyond belief.
18423,I think we're going to the moon because it's in the nature of the human being to face challenges. It's by the nature of his deep inner soul... we're required to do these things just as salmon swim upstream.
18424,"The single thing which makes any man happiest is the realization that he has worked up to the limits of his ability, his capacity. It's all the better, of course, if this work has made a contribution to knowledge, or toward moving the human race a little farther forward."
18425,"We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11."
18426,Research is creating new knowledge.
18427,I think if there was anything I learned from our skipper was that it's not how you look; it's how you perform.
18428,"Gliders, sail planes, they're wonderful flying machines. It's the closest you can come to being a bird."
18429,I guess we all like to be recognized not for one piece of fireworks but for the ledger of our daily work.
18430,"The important achievement of Apollo was demonstrating that humanity is not forever chained to this planet, and our visions go rather further than that, and our opportunities are unlimited."
18431,"In flying, the probability of survival is inversely proportional to the angle of arrival."
18432,Geologists have a saying - rocks remember.
18433,The Eagle has landed.
18434,
18435,"May your coming year be filled with magic and dreams and good madness. I hope you read some fine books and kiss someone who thinks you're wonderful, and don't forget to make some art -- write or draw or build or sing or live as only you can. And I hope, somewhere in the next year, you surprise yourself."
18436,"Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten."
18437,"The one thing that you have that nobody else has is you. Your voice, your mind, your story, your vision. So write and draw and build and play and dance and live as only you can."
18438,"The only thing that kept me going was stories. Stories are hope. They take you out of yourself for a bit, and when you get dropped back in, you're different- you're stronger, you've seen more, you've felt more. Stories are like spiritual currency."
18439,"I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're Doing Something."
18440,
18441,"Let's start a new tomorrow, today."
18442,"Google can bring you back 100,000 answers. A librarian can bring you back the right one."
18443,"Fiction gives us empathy: it puts us inside the minds of other people, gives us the gifts of seeing the world through their eyes. Fiction is a lie that tells us true things, over and over."
18444,
18445,"Read. Read anything. Read the things they say are good for you, and the things they claim are junk. You'll find what you need to find. Just read."
18446,"There are lots of artists in the world. But there's only one you. And the only person who has your point of view is you. If you decide not to make things, all you've done is deprive the world of all the stuff that only you could have brought to it."
18447,Sometimes the best way to learn something is by doing it wrong and looking at what you did.
18448,"Well-meaning adults can easily destroy a child’s love of reading: stop them reading what they enjoy, or give them worthy-but-dull books that you like, the 21st-century equivalents of Victorian “improving” literature. You’ll wind up with a generation convinced that reading is uncool and worse, unpleasant."
18449,"Stories you read when you're the right age never quite leave you. You may forget who wrote them or what the story was called. Sometimes you'll forget precisely what happened, but if a story touches you it will stay with you, haunting the places in your mind that you rarely ever visit."
18450,The world always seems brighter when you've just made something that wasn't there before.
18451,I fell for her like a suicide from a bridge.
18452,"I hope you will have a wonderful year, that you'll dream dangerously and outrageously, that you'll make something that didn't exist before you made it, that you will be loved and that you will be liked, and that you will have people to love and to like in return. And, most importantly (because I think there should be more kindness and more wisdom in the world right now), that you will, when you need to be, be wise, and that you will always be kind."
18453,"People think dreams aren't real just because they aren't made of matter, of particles. Dreams are real. But they are made of viewpoints, of images, of memories and puns and lost hopes."
18454,It has been said that civilization is twenty-four hours and two meals away from barbarism.
18455,"I will write in words of fire. I will write them on your skin. I will write about desire. Write beginnings, write of sin. You’re the book I love the best, your skin only holds my truth, you will be a palimpsest lines of age rewriting youth. You will not burn upon the pyre. Or be buried on the shelf. You’re my letter to desire: And you’ll never read yourself. I will trace each word and comma As the final dusk descends, You’re my tale of dreams and drama, Let us find out how it ends."
18456,"Whatever it takes to finish things, finish. You will learn more from a glorious failure than you ever will from something you never finished."
18457,"People who believe they'll be happy if they go and live somewhere else, learn it doesn't work that way. Wherever you go, you take yourself with you."
18458,"She seems so cool, so focused, so quiet, yet her eyes remain fixed upon the horizon. You think you know all there is to know about her immediately upon meeting her, but everything you think you know is wrong. Passion flows through her like a river of blood. She only looked away for a moment, and the mask slipped, and you fell. All your tomorrows start here."
18459,
18460,"In the end, it's the people who are curious who change the world."
18461,The Universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.
18462,
18463,The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it.
18464,"Need a distraction today? Not only does 12 + 1 = 11 + 2, but the letters ""twelve plus one"" rearrange to give you ""eleven plus two."""
18465,"One of the biggest problems with the world today is that we have large groups of people who will accept whatever they hear on the grapevine, just because it suits their worldview—not because it is actually true or because they have evidence to support it. The really striking thing is that it would not take much effort to establish validity in most of these cases… but people prefer reassurance to research."
18466,
18467,"Claiming there is no other life in the universe is like scooping up some water, looking at the cup and claiming there are no whales in the ocean."
18468,"The problem in society is not kids not knowing science. The problem is adults not knowing science. They outnumber kids 5 to 1, they wield power, they write legislation. When you have scientifically illiterate adults, you have undermined the very fabric of what makes a nation wealthy and strong."
18469,"The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when you look for things like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. For me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And along the way, lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you."
18470,"The most successful people recognize that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation."
18471,"I dream of a world where the truth is what shapes people's politics, rather than politics shaping what people think is true."
18472,"When scientifically investigating the natural world, the only thing worse than a blind believer is a seeing denier."
18473,"The molecules that comprise our body are traceable to the crucibles of the centers of stars.These atoms and molecules are in us because, in fact, the universe is in us. And, we are not only figuratively, but literally, stardust."
18474,"People cited violation of the First Amendment when a New Jersey schoolteacher asserted that evolution and the Big Bang are not scientific and that Noah's ark carried dinosaurs. This case is not about the need to separate church and state; it's about the need to separate ignorant, scientifically illiterate people from the ranks of teachers."
18475,"We hunger for significance, for signs that our personal existence is of special meaning to the universe. To that end, we’re all too eager to deceive ourselves and others, to discern a sacred image in a grilled cheese sandwich or find a divine warning in a comet"
18476,It's better to understand something than to memorize something.
18477,Everyone should have their mind blown once a day.
18478,Our nation is turning into an idiocracy.
18479,Perhaps we’ve never been visited by aliens because they have looked upon earth and decided there’s no sign of intelligent life.
18480,"Imagination alone is not enough, because the reality of nature is far more wondrous than anything we can imagine"
18481,"We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically."
18482,To assert that the universe has a purpose implies the universe has intent. And intent implies a desired outcome. But who would do the desiring? And what would a desired outcome be? That carbon-based life is inevitable? Or that sentient primates are life's neurological pinnacle? Are answers to these questions even possible without expressing a profound bias of human sentiment? Of course humans were not around to ask these questions for 99.9999% of cosmic history. So if the purpose of the universe was to create humans then the cosmos was embarrassingly inefficient about it.
18483,No one is dumb who is curious. The people who don't ask questions remain clueless throughout their lives.
18484,
18485,
18486,"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite."
18487,You can never have an impact on society if you have not changed yourself.
18488,"Do not judge me by my success, judge me by how many times I fell down and got back up again."
18489,
18490,It only seems impossible until it's done.
18491,"Living isn't just about doing for yourself,but what you do for others as well."
18492,What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead.
18493,Fools multiply when wise men are silent.
18494,It is not where you start but how high you aim that matters for success.
18495,"Education is the great engine of personal development. It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor, that the son of a mineworker can become the head of the mine, that a child of farm workers can become the president of a great nation. It is what we make out of what we have, not what we are given, that separates one person from another."
18496,Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.
18497,Love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.
18498,
18499,A winner is a dreamer who never gives up
18500,Resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies.
18501,"May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears."
18502,We can change the world and make it a better place. It is in your hands to make a difference.
18503,"Our fear is not that we are inadequate, but that we are powerful beyond measure."
18504,Blaming things on the past does not make them better.
18505,There is nothing more dangerous than a humiliated man.
18506,There is no easy walk to freedom anywhere.
18507,I like friends who have independent minds because they tend to make you see problems from all angles.
18508,Thinking is one of the most important weapons in dealing with problems
18509,
18510,"The present moment contains past and future. The secret of transformation, is in the way we handle this very moment."
18511,"Happiness is not an individual matter. When you are able to bring relief, or bring back the smile to one person, not only that person profits, but you also profit."
18512,Many of us have been running all our lives. Practice stopping.
18513,"When you suffer, you can look deeply at your situation and find the many blessings that are already surrounding you. It is wonderful to sit with a pen and paper and write down all the conditions for happiness that are already there, already available to you right in this moment."
18514,"To be beautiful means to be yourself.You don't need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. When you are born a lotus flower, be a beautiful lotus flower, don't try to be a magnolia flower. If you crave acceptance and recognition and try to change yourself to fit what other people want you to be, you will suffer all your life. True happiness and true power lie in understanding yourself, accepting yourself, having confidence in yourself."
18515,"Our mind is the foundation of all our actions, whether they are actions of body, speech, or mind, i.e., thinking. Whatever we think, say, or do arises from our mind. What our consciousness consumes becomes the substance of our life, so we have to be very careful which nutriments we ingest."
18516,"Silence is essential. We need silence just as much as we need air, just as much as plants need light. If our minds are crowded with words and thoughts, there is no space for us."
18517,"The moment you understand the importance of loving yourself, you will stop hurting others."
18518,"Breathing in, I am aware that I am breathing in.
Breathing out, I am aware that I am breathing out.
Breathing in, I am grateful for this moment.
Breathing out, I smile.
Breathing in, I am aware of the preciousness of this day.
Breathing out, I vow to live deeply in this day."
18519,"When you learn how to suffer, you suffer much less."
18520,"Around us, life bursts with miracles--a glass of water, a ray of sunshine, a leaf, a caterpillar, a flower, laughter, raindrops. If you live in awareness, it is easy to see miracles everywhere. Each human being is a multiplicity of miracles. Eyes that see thousands of colors, shapes, and forms; ears that hear a bee flying or a thunderclap; a brain that ponders a speck of dust as easily as the entire cosmos; a heart that beats in rhythm with the heartbeat of all beings. When we are tired and feel discouraged by life's daily struggles, we may not notice these miracles, but they are always there."
18521,"You are me, and I am you. Isn't it obvious that we ""inter-are""? You cultivate the flower in yourself, so that I will be beautiful. I transform the garbage in myself, so that you will not have to suffer."
18522,You do not suffer because things are impermanent. You suffer because things are impermanent and you think they are permanent.
18523,"In every one of us there are good seeds and bad. We have the seed of brotherhood, love, compassion, insight. But we have also the seed of anger, hate, dissent."
18524,"Breath is the bridge which connects life to consciousness, which unites your body to your thoughts. Whenever your mind becomes scattered, use your breath as the means to take hold of your mind again."
18525,"Letting go gives us freedom, and freedom is the only condition for happiness. If, in our heart, we still cling to anything - anger, anxiety, or possessions - we cannot be free."
18526,No one is more worthy of your kindness and compassion than you are.
18527,In each of us is a seed of understanding. The seed is God.
18528,"When we give ourselves the chance to let go of all our tension, the body's natural capacity to heal itself can begin to work."
18529,You must love in such a way that the person you love feels free.
18530,"In our consciousness, there are many negative seeds and also many positive seeds. The practice is to avoid watering the negative seeds, and to identify and water the positive seeds every day."
18531,"Thanks to impermanence, everything is possible."
18532,"Go back and take care of yourself. Your body needs you, your feelings need you, your perceptions need you. Your suffering needs you to acknowledge it. Go home and be there for all these things."
18533,"Choose to be in touch with what is wonderful, refreshing, and healing within yourself and around you."
18534,
18535,
18536,"It's the possibility that keeps me going, not the guarantee."
18537,You might not believe it...but you make the world a better place when you smile.
18538,Nothing that’s worthwhile is ever easy. Remember that.
18539,"I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough."
18540,"You know, the smallest thing can change a life. In the blink of an eye, something happens by chance - and when you least expect it - since we’re on a course that you could have never planned, into a future you never imagined. Where will it take you? That’s the journey of our lives: our search for the light. But sometimes, finding the light means you must past through the deepest darkness."
18541,How far should a person go in the name of true love?
18542,"I mean, if the relationship can't survive the long term, why on earth would it be worth my time and energy for the short term?"
18543,Love hurts. There is nothing as painful as heartbreak. But in order to learn to love again you must learn to trust again.
18544,I want to wake up with you beside me in the mornings. I want to spend my evenings looking at you across the dinner table. I want to share every mundane detail of my day with you and hear every detail of yours. I want to laugh with you and fall asleep with you in my arms.
18545,"Thank you for coming into my life and giving me joy, thank you for loving me and receiving my love in return. Thank you for the memories I will cherish forever. But most of all, thank you for showing me that there will come a time when I can eventually let you go."
18546,The scariest thing about distance is that you don’t know whether they’ll miss you or forget you.
18547,"She wanted something else, something different, something more. Passion and romance, perhaps, or maybe quiet conversations in candlelit rooms, or perhaps something as simple as not being second."
18548,I dont think that we're meant to understand it all the time. I think that sometimes we just have to have faith.
18549,"The reason it hurts so much to separate is because our souls are connected. Maybe they always have been and will be. Maybe we've lived a thousand lives before this one and in each of them we've found each other. And maybe each time, we've been forced apart for the same reasons. That means that this goodbye is both a goodbye for the past ten thousand years and a prelude to what will come."
18550,"I love you now for what we've already shared, and I love you now in anticipation of all that's to come."
18551,Loving someone and having them love you back is the most precious thing in the world.
18552,It’s never too late to do the right thing.
18553,"What mattered most was knowing that love was mine to give, without strings or expectations."
18554,"If it’s over, then don’t let the past screw up the rest of your life."
18555,Being around someone who accepts and supports you will remind you to accept and support yourself.
18556,"It's possible to go on, no matter how impossible it seems."
18557,"I know that somehow, every step I took since the moment I could walk was a step towards finding you."
18558,"You're going to come across people in your life who will say all the right words at all the right times. But in the end, it's always their actions you should judge them by. It's actions, not words, that matter."
18559,
18560,"If you have the desire and passion to do something, and it's within God's will, you will achieve it."
18561,Just because I don't understand god's plans does not mean that he is not with me.
18562,"I am gonna try again and again, because the moment I give up, is the moment I fail."
18563,There's no point in being complete on the outside when you're broken in the inside.
18564,"I may have absolutely no control over what happens to us, but we can control how we respond. If we choose the right attitude, we can rise above whatever challenges we face."
18565,"People always complain that they can't do this and they can't do that."" 

 ""If we look at our lives and concentrate on things that we don't have or wish to have, that doesn't change the circumstances. The truth is that we have to focus on what we have and make the best out of it."

18571,To wish for change will change nothing; To make the decision to take action right now will change everything.

18579,"The greatest rewards come when you give of yourself. It's about bettering the lives of others, being part of something bigger than yourself, and making a positive difference."
18580,"Often people ask how I manage to be happy despite having no arms and no legs. The quick answer is that I have a choice. I can be angry about not having limbs, or I can be thankful that I have a purpose. I chose gratitude."
18581,It's a lie to think you're not good enough. It's a lie to think you're not worth anything.
18582,"In life you have a choice: Bitter or Better? Choose better, forget bitter."
18583,Fear is a bigger disability than having no arms and no legs.
18584,
18585,Forget the past. You can never predict what the future is going to be. Live for the moment.
18586,Sometimes your mistakes are you biggest virtues. You learn so much from the mistake. Those things that you think are the worst thing that's happening to you can somehow turn around and be the greatest opportunity.
18587,Breathe and don't try to be perfect.
18588,"Whatever you do in life, don't give up on your own dreams."
18589,"Men don't pay you for sex, they pay you to leave after sex."

18591,"No matter how much you're going to be criticized or no matter how big of a risk it is, the boldness is the thing that helps you"
18592,"I always try to push through fear. I won't be crippled by it. People say, ""Oh  you take such risks"", or ""You're brave."" And I'm like, 'Well, if you knew - inside I'm really frightened!' But the way people navigate fear and pain is fascinating... The more you feel, the stronger the pain. And the more you engage in life, the more you have to lose."
18593,"I'm not sure what the future holds but I do know that I'm going to be positive and not wake up feeling desperate. As my dad said 'Nic, it is what it is, it's not what it should have been, not what it could have been, it is what it is.'"
18594,You can't find peace by hiding from life
18595,"Have no regrets. Every relationship leads you to where you're meant to be. Learn to be comfortable with being alone. Learn to be comfortable with saying no to people; we put everybody else before ourselves. Read great literature; don't get all your information from TV. Define your moral code - nobody else is going to give you that. Find it yourself. Keep asking questions, keep challenging. You don't have to conform. Rebellion creates character. And, as my mother always said to me, ""Don't let anyone break your spirit!"""
18596,"If you enter the dark side of life, and come through it, you emerge with more strength and passion."
18597,"It's good to have a little distance. If you discuss your love too much, it just damages it."

18607,I like exploring life and its complexities.

18609,
18610,"A decision is made with the brain. A commitment is made with the heart. Therefore, a commitment is much deeper and more binding than a decision"

18612,"Winners compare their achievements with their goals, while losers compare their achievements with those of other people."
18613,"Are you a thermometer or a thermostat?  A thermometer only reflects the temperature of its  environment, adjusting to the situation. But a thermostat initiates  action to change the temperature in its environment"

18628,Motivation without mobilization means only frustration.
18629,Those who are afraid to fail may not deserve to succeed.
18630,Material success may result in the accumulation of possessions: but only spiritual success will enable you to enjoy them.
18631,One of the greatest resources people cannot mobilize themselves is that they try to accomplish great things. Most worthwhile achievements are the result of many little things done in a single direction.
18632,People who invariably put themselves first will find that others tend to put them last.

18649,Peace can only come as a natural consequence of universal enlightenment.
18650,"Alpha waves in the human brain are between 6 and 8 hertz. The wave frequency of the human cavity resonates between 6 and 8 hertz. All biological systems operate in the same frequency range. The human brain's alpha waves function in this range and the electrical resonance of the earth is between 6 and 8 hertz. Thus, our entire biological system - the brain and the earth itself - work on the same frequencies. If we can control that resonate system electronically, we can directly control the entire mental system of humankind."

18659,
18660,
18661,"The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum - even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there's free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate."
18662,Nobody is going to pour truth into your brain. It's something you have to find out for yourself.

18665,"Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, it’s unlikely you will step up and take responsibility for making it so. If you assume that there’s no hope, you guarantee that there will be no hope. If you assume that there is an instinct for freedom, there are opportunities to change things, there’s a chance you may contribute to making a better world. The choice is yours."
18666,"It takes one minute to tell a lie, and an hour to refute it."
18667,The indoctrination is so deep that educated people think they’re being objective.
18668,"The key element of social control is the strategy of distraction that is to divert public attention from important issues and changes decided by political and economic elites, through the technique of flood or flooding continuous distractions and insignificant information."
18669,Democratic societies can't force people. Therefore they have to control what they think.
18670,It’s ridiculous to talk about freedom in a society dominated by huge corporations. What kind of freedom is there inside a corporation? They’re totalitarian institutions - you take orders from above and maybe give them to people below you. There’s about as much freedom as under Stalinism.
18671,"That's the standard technique of privatization: defund, make sure things don't work, people get angry, you hand it over to private capital."
18672,"The public is not to see where power lies, how it shapes policy, and for what ends. Rather, people are to hate and fear one another."
18673,"The process of shaping opinion, attitudes, and perceptions was termed the 'engineering of consent' by one of the founders of the modern public relations industry, Edward Bernays."
18674,
18675,"If you assume that there is no hope, you guarantee that there will be no hope. If you assume that there is an instinct for freedom, that there are opportunities to change things, then there is a possibility that you can contribute to making a better world."
18676,"Neoliberal democracy. Instead of citizens, it produces consumers. Instead of communities, it produces shopping malls. The net result is an atomized society of disengaged individuals who feel demoralized and socially powerless. In sum, neoliberalism is the immediate and foremost enemy of genuine participatory democracy, not just in the United States but across the planet, and will be for the foreseeable future."
18677,"The whole educational and professional training system is a very elaborate filter, which just weeds out people who are too independent, and who think for themselves, and who don't know how to be submissive, and so on -- because they're dysfunctional to the institutions."
18678,"If voting could actually change anything, it would be illegal."
18679,"Globalization is the result of powerful governments, especially that of the United States, pushing trade deals and other accords down the throats of the world’s people to make it easier for corporations and the wealthy to dominate the economies of nations around the world without having obligations to the peoples of those nations."
18680,"Jingoism, racism, fear, religious fundamentalism: these are the ways of appealing to people if you're trying to organize a mass base of support for policies that are really intended to crush them."
18681,"The point of public relations slogans like ""Support Our Troops"" is that they don't mean anything ... that's the whole point of good propaganda. You want to create a slogan that nobody is going to be against and I suppose everybody will be for, because nobody knows what it means, because it doesn't mean anything. But its crucial value is that it diverts your attention from a question that does mean something, do you support our policy? And that's the one you're not allowed to talk about."
18682,Nobody should have any illusions. The United States has essentially a one-party system and the ruling party is the business party.
18683,"A language is not just words. It's a culture, a tradition, a unification of a community, a whole history that creates what a community is. It's all embodied in a language."
18684,
18685,"Whatever you choose, however many roads you travel, I hope that you choose not to be a lady. I hope you will find some way to break the rules and make a little trouble out there. And I also hope that you will choose to make some of that trouble on behalf of women."

18687,"You can settle for reality, or you can go off, like a fool, and dream another dream."
18688,Insane people are always sure they're just fine. It's only the sane people who are willing to admit they're crazy.
18689,"You're born, you die. Everything in between is subject to interpretation."
18690,"Reading is everything. Reading makes me feel like I've accomplished something, learned something, become a better person. Reading makes me smarter. Reading gives me something to talk about later on. Reading is the unbelievably healthy way my attention deficit disorder medicates itself. Reading is escape, and the opposite of escape; it's a way to make contact with reality after a day of making things up, and it's a way of making contact with someone else's imagination after a day that's all too real. Reading is grist. Reading is bliss."
18691,"So, twice a week, I go to a beauty salon and have my hair blown dry. It’s cheaper by far than psychoanalysis, and much more uplifting."
18692,And don't be frightened: you can always change your mind. I know: I've had four careers and three husbands.
18693,Most of us live our lives devoid of cinematic moments.
18694,"When I buy a new book, I always read the last page first, that way in case I die before I finish, I know how it ends. That, my friend, is a dark side."
18695,I don't think any day is worth living without thinking about what you're going to eat next at all times.
18696,"Here are some questions I am constantly noodling over: Do you splurge or do you hoard? Do you live every day as if it's your last, or do you save your money on the chance you'll live twenty more years? Is life too short, or is it going to be too long? Do you work as hard as you can, or do you slow down to smell the roses? And where do carbohydrates fit into all this? Are we really all going to spend our last years avoiding bread, especially now that bread in American is so unbelievable delicious? And what about chocolate?"
18697,"When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible."
18698,I am continually fascinated at the difficulty intelligent people have in distinguishing what is controversial from what is merely offensive.
18699,You can't meet someone until you become what you're becoming.
18700,Never marry a man you wouldn't want to be divorced from.
18701,"You do get to a certain point in life where you have to realistically, I think, understand that the days are getting shorter, and you can't put things off thinking you'll get to them someday. If you really want to do them, you better do them. There are simply too many people getting sick, and sooner or later you will. So I'm very much a believer in knowing what it is that you love doing so you can do a great deal of it."
18702,I'm very much a believer in knowing what it is that you love doing so you can do a great deal of it.
18703,"I think if you're lucky enough to find a voice in whatever you do, that voice will come sneaking out no matter what."
18704,Take notes. Everything is copy.
18705,"Everyone always asks, was he mad at you for writing the book? and I have to say, Yes, yes, he was. He still is. It is one of the most fascinating things to me about the whole episode: he cheated on me, and then got to behave as if he was the one who had been wronged because I wrote about it! I mean, it's not as if I wasn't a writer. It's not as if I hadn't often written about myself. I'd even written about him. What did he think was going to happen? That I would take a vow of silence for the first time in my life? """
18706,"Oh, how I regret not having worn a bikini for the entire year I was twenty-six. If anyone young is reading this, go, right this minute, put on a bikini, and don't take it off until you're thirty-four."
18707,"Reading is escape, and the opposite of escape."
18708,"And so, Thanksgiving. Its the most amazing holiday. Just think about it — it's a miracle that once a year so many millions of Americans sit down to exactly the same meal as one another, exactly the same meal they grew up eating, and exactly the same meal they ate a year earlier. The turkey. The sweet potatoes. The stuffing. The pumpkin pie. Is there anything else we all can agree so vehemently about? I don't think so."
18709,

18723,"If you don't ask, the answer is always no."

18726,Life is full of circles

18728,"You spend your life getting walked on, you learn to recognize the tread."
18729,"Do you know how many ways love can hit you? So it makes you happy, or miserable? It makes you sick in the belly or hurt in the heart. It makes everything brighter and sharper, or it blurs all the edges. It makes you feel like a king or a fool. Every way love can hit you, it's hit me when it comes to you."

Look at the sunny side of everything. Think only the best, be as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. Forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future. Give everyone a smile. Spend so much time improving yourself that you have no time left to criticize others. Be too big for worry and too noble for anger."
18735,A positive thinker does not refuse to recognize the negative; he refuses to dwell on it. Positive thinking is a form of thought which habitually looks for the best results from the worst conditions
18736,A peaceful mind generates power.
18737,"The way to happiness: Keep your heart free from hate, your mind from worry. Live simply, expect little, give much. Scatter sunshine, forget self, think of others. Try this for a week and you will be surprised."

18741,Dwelling on negative thoughts is like fertilizing weeds.
18742,"One of the most powerful concepts, one which is a sure cure for lack of confidence, is the thought that God is with you and helping you. This is one of the simplest teachings in religion, namely, that Almighty God will be your companion, will stand by you, help you, and see you through. No other idea is so powerful in developing self-confidence as this simple belief when practiced. To practice it simply affirm ""God is with me; God is helping me; God is guiding me."" Spend several minutes each day visualizing his presence. Then practice believing that affirmation."

 your power to change things."

18759,
18760,"Husbands and wives, if you guys don’t have a beautiful marriage, a loving marriage, a romantic marriage you are ruining your eeman! You have to have a marriage so awesome that you don’t have to look at the character of a movie or a play and say ‘i wish i had a marriage like this’, your marriage should be better than that because otherwise, Sheytan will come to each one of you and say ‘man i wonder, is there anything better out there, why am I stuck in this?’ Both husband and wife have to work hard to make their relationship work not for yourselves but for your eeman!"

18778,"It is not true that if we had true faith we would not be sad. Prophets (as), and righteous people experienced a great deal of sadness. The Quran is full of stories in which the central theme is sadness. Sadness is a reality of life. The Quran is not there to eliminate sadness, but to navigate it. Sadness is one of the tests of life, just as happiness, and anger are tests."
18779,"When you find yourself in a position to help someone, be happy because Allah is answering that person’s prayer through you."
18780,"Forget bad deeds, even the good we do are full of mistakes."
18781,The real Da'wah to Islam is the character of a Muslim.
18782,"Every single night our soul is taken, and every single night the Angel asks before bringing it back, ""Ya Allah what about this one?"" ""Do You want to send it back?"" Do You want to pull the plug or should we keep the Ruh (soul)?"" And every night Allah gives permission to the Angel to let us live one more time."""
18783,"What you desire is what YOU want, what you 
 have is what ALLAH wants."
18784,
18785,"The Mexican...is familiar with death. [He] jokes about it, caresses it, sleeps with it, celebrates it. It is one of his favorite toys and his most steadfast love."
18786,"A flower without a stem, is beauty waiting to die. A heart without love, is a tear waiting to cry."
18787,"What sets worlds in motion is the interplay of differences, their attractions and repulsions. Life is plurality, death is uniformity. By suppressing differences and pecularities, by eliminating different civilizations and cultures, progress weakens life and favors death. The ideal of a single civilization for everyone, implicit in the cult of progress and technique, impoverishes and mutilates us. Every view of the world that becomes extinct, every culture that disappears, diminishes a possibility of life"
18788,Deserve your dream.
18789,Love is not a desire for beauty; it is a yearning for completion.
18790,Solitude is the profoundest fact of the human condition. Man is the only being who knows he is alone.
18791,"The supreme value is not the future but the present. The future is a deceitful time that always says to us, 'Not Yet,' and thus denies us... Whoever builds a house for future happiness builds a prison for the present."
18792,A civilization that denies death ends by denying life.
18793,Light is time thinking about itself.
18794,"Reality is a staircase going neither up nor down, we don't move; today is today, always is today."
18795,"To love is to battle, to open doors, to cease to be a ghost with a number forever in chains, forever condemned by a faceless master; the world changes if two look at each other and see."
18796,The purpose of poetry is to restore to mankind the possibility to wonder.
18797,To read a poem is to hear it with our eyes; to hear it is to see it with our ears.
18798,"Beyond happiness or unhappiness, though it is both things, love is intensity; it does not give us eternity but life, that second in which the doors of time and space open just a crack: here is there and now is always."
18799,To love is to undress our names.
18800,To fight evil is to fight ourselves.
18801,Believing ourselves to be possessors of absolute truth degrades us: we regard every person whose way of thinking is different from ours as a monster and a threat and by so doing turn our own selves into monsters and threats to our fellows.
18802,"Love is an attempt at penetrating another being, but it can only succeed if the surrender is mutual."
18803,Every moment is nothing without end.
18804,"Eroticism is first and foremost a thirst for otherness. And the supernatural is the supreme otherness. This is perhaps the most noble aim of poetry, to attach ourselves to the world around us, to turn desire into love, to embrace, finally what always evades us, what is beyond, but what is always there – the unspoken, the spirit, the soul."
18805,Modern man likes to pretend that his thinking is wide-awake. But this wide-awake thinking has led us into the mazes of a nightmare in which the torture chambers are endlessly repeated in the mirrors of reason.
18806,"Distraction is our habitual state. Not the distraction of the person who withdraws from the world in order to shut himself up in the secret and ever-changing land of his fantasy, but the distraction of the person who is always outside himself, lost in the trivial, senseless, turmoil of everyday life."
18807,"My body, plowed by your body, will turn into a field where one is sown and a hundred reaped."
18808,The world is born when two people kiss
18809,
18810,"Realize that true happiness lies within you. Waste no time and effort searching for peace and contentment and joy in the world outside. Remember that there is no happiness in having or in getting, but only in giving. Reach out. Share. Smile. Hug. Happiness is a perfume you cannot pour on others without getting a few drops on yourself."
18811,"Your only limitations are those you set up in your mind, or permit others to set up for you."
18812,I will greet this day with love in my heart. And how will I do this? Henceforth will I look on all things with love and be born again. I will love the sun for it warms my bones; yet I will love the rain for it cleanses my spirit. I will love the light for it shows me the way; yet I will love the darkness for it shows me the stars. I will welcome happiness as it enlarges my heart; yet I will endure sadness for it opens my soul. I will acknowledge rewards for they are my due; yet I will welcome obstacles for they are my challenge.
18813,"Beginning today, treat everyone you meet as if they were going to be dead by midnight. Extend to them all the care, kindness and understanding you can muster, and do it with no thought of any reward. Your life will never be the same again."
18814,"Count your blessings. Once you realize how valuable you are and how much you have going for you, the smiles will return, the sun will break out, the music will play, and you will finally be able to move forward the life that God intended for you with grace, strength, courage, and confidence."
18815,Victory comes only after many struggles and countless defeats.
18816,"Never allow anyone to rain on your parade and thus cast a pall of gloom and defeat on the entire day. Remember that no talent, no self-denial, no brains, no character, are required to set up in the fault-finding business. Nothing external can have any power over you unless you permit it. Your time is too precious to be sacrificed in wasted days combating the menial forces of hate, jealously, and envy. Guard your fragile life carefully. Only God can shape a flower, but any foolish child can pull it to pieces."
18817,"Remember that the most difficult tasks are consummated, not by a single explosive burst of energy or effort, but by the constant daily application of the best you have within you."
18818,Shake off your blunders. How will you know your limits without an occasional failure? Never quit. Your turn will come.
18819,"Take the attitude of a student, never be too big to ask questions, never know too much to learn something new."
18820,I will welcome happiness for it enlarges my heart; Yet I will endure sadness for it opens my soul. I will acknowledge rewards for they are my due; Yet I will welcome obstacles for they are my challenge.
18821,
18822,All the gold in the world cannot buy a dying man one more breath--so what does that make today worth?
18823,"So long as I can laugh, never will I be poor."
18824,"The only certain means of success is to render more and better service than is expected of you, no matter what the task may be. This is a habit followed by all successful people since the beginning of time. Therefore I saith the surest way to doom yourself to mediocrity is to perform only the work for which you are paid."
18825,"Welcome every morning with a smile. Look on the new day as another special gift from your Creator, another golden opportunity to complete what you were unable to finish yesterday. Be a self-starter. Let your first hour set the theme of success and positive action that is certain to echo through your entire day. Today will never happen again. Don't waste it with a false start or no start at all. You were not born to fail."
18826,"Always do your best. What you plant now, you will harvest later."
18827,Today will never happen again. Don't waste it with a false start or no start at all.
18828,Success and rest don't sleep together.
18829,Weak is he who permits his thoughts to control his actions; strong is he who forces his actions to control his thoughts.
18830,"What is past is past. You can do nothing about yesterday and last month and the failures of last year, but you can do everything toward making tomorrow and the rest of your life what you always dreamed it could be."
18831,"Whenever you make a mistake or get knocked down by life, don't look back at it too long. Mistakes are life's way of teaching you. Your capacity for occasional blunders is inseparable from your capacity to reach your goals. No one wins them all, and your failures, when they happen, are just part of your growth. Shake off your blunders. How will you know your limits without an occasional failure? Never quit. Your turn will come."
18832,"I will persist until I succeed. Always will I take another step. If that is of no avail I will take another, and yet another. In truth, one step at a time is not too difficult... I know that small attempts, repeated, will complete any undertaking."
18833,"I am here for a purpose and that purpose is to grow into a mountain, not to shrink to a grain of sand."
18834,
18835,"Whenever you're wrong, admit it; Whenever you're right, shut up."
18836,The door of a bigoted mind opens outwards so that the only result of the pressure of facts upon it is to close it more snugly.
18837,
18838,"Some tortures are physical And some are mental, But the one that is both Is dental."
18839,God in His wisdom made the fly And then forgot to tell us why.
18840,"Among other things I think humor is a shield, a weapon, a survival kit. So here we are several billion of us, crowded into our global concentration camp for the duration. How are we to survive? Solemnity is not the answer, any more than witless and irresponsible frivolity is. I think our best chance lies in humor, which in this case means a wry acceptance of our predicament. We don't have to like it but we can at least recognize its ridiculous aspects, one of which is ourselves."
18841,One thing about the past. It's likely to last.
18842,"Marriage is the alliance of two people, one of whom never remembers birthdays and the other who never forgets them."
18843,"Some primal termite knocked on wood.
And tasted it, and found it good.
And that is why your Cousin May
Fell through the parlor floor today."
18844,"I am a conscientious man, when I throw rocks at seabirds I leave no tern unstoned."
18845,Here's a good rule of thumb; too clever is dumb.
18846,Happiness is having a scratch for every itch.
18847,Wind is caused by the trees waving their branches.

18853,I believe that people believe what they believe they believe.
18854,"Abracadabra, thus we learn
The more you create, the less you earn.
The less you earn, the more you're given,
The less you lead, the more you're driven,
The more destroyed, the more they feed,
The more you pay, the more they need,
The more you earn, the less you keep,
And now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to take
If the tax-collector hasn't got it before I wake."
18855,Too much Chablis can make you whablis.
18856,"The truth I do not stretch or shove
 When I state the dog is full of love.
 I've also proved, by actual test,
 A wet dog is the lovingest."
18857,"I do not like to get the news, because there has never been an era when so many things were going so right for so many of the wrong persons."

18859,
18860,"The Spirit of prayer makes us so intimate with God that we scarcely pass through an experience before we speak to Him about it, either in supplication, in sighing, in pouring out our woes before Him, in fervent requests, or in thanksgiving and adoration."
18861,"To pray is to let God into our lives. He knocks and seeks admittance, not only in the solemn hours of secret prayer. He knocks in the midst of your daily work, your daily struggles, your daily grind. That is when you need Him most."
18862,Prayer and helplessness are inseparable. Only he who is helpless can truly pray. Your helplessness is your best. prayer.
18863,Prayer is the conduit through which power from heaven is brought to earth.
18864,"There come times when I have nothing more to tell God. If I were to continue to pray in words, I would have to repeat what I have already said. At such times it is wonderful to say to God, ""May I be in Thy presence, Lord? I have nothing more to say to Thee, but I do love to be in Thy presence."""
18865,"See to it, night and day, that you pray for your children. Then you will leave them a great legacy of answers to prayer, which will follow them all the days of their life. Then you may calmly and with a good conscience depart from them, even though you may not leave them a great deal of material wealth."
18866,"Begin to realize more and more that prayer is the most important thing you do. You can use your time to no better advantage than to pray whenever you have an opportunity to do so, either alone or with others; while at work, while at rest, or while walking down the street. Anywhere!"
18867,"It is God's will not only to hear our prayer, but to give us the best and the richest answer which He, the almighty and omniscient God, can devise. He will send us the answer when it will benefit us and His cause the most."
18868,"Notice carefully every word here. It is not our prayer which draws Jesus into our hearts. Nor is it our prayer which moves Jesus to come in to us. All He needs is access. He enters in of His own accord, because He desires to come in. To pray is nothing more involved than to let Jesus into our needs, and permitting Him to exercise His own power in dealing with them. And that requires no strength. It is only a question of our wills. Will we give Jesus access to our needs?."
18869,"Jesus is not made of stone. He is moved to happiness every time He sees that you appreciate what He has done for you. Grip His pierced hand and say to Him, ""I thank Thee, Savior , because Thou hast died for me."" Thank Him likewise for all the other blessings He has showered upon you from day to day."
18870,Be sure to remember that nothing in your daily life is so insignificant and so inconsequential that the Lord will not help you by answering your prayer.
18871,"Our prayer life will become restful when it really dawns upon us that we have done all we are supposed to do when we have spoken to Him about it. From the moment we have left it with Him, it is His responsi-bility."
18872,Helplessness is the real secret and the impelling power of prayer.
18873,"The more helpless you are, the better you are fitted to pray, and the more answers to prayer you will experience."
18874,"To pray is nothing more involved than to open the door, giving Jesus access to our needs and permitting Him to exercise His own power in dealing with them."
18875,Only he who is helpless can truly pray.
18876,"Pray a little each day in a childlike way for the Spirit of prayer. If you feel that you know, as yet, very little concerning the deep things of prayer and what prayer really is, then pray for the Spirit of prayer. There is nothing He would rather do than unveil to you the grace of prayer."
18877,We need to learn to know Him so well that we feel safe when we have left our difficulties with Him. To know in that way is a prerequisite of all true prayer.
18878,"A humble and contrite heart knows that it can merit nothing before God, and that all that is necessary is to be reconciled to one's helplessness and let our holy and almighty God care for us, just as an infant surrenders himself to his mother's care."
18879,Helplessness is your best prayer. It calls from your heart to the heart of God with greater effect than all your uttered pleas.
18880,"As impossible as it is for us to take a breath in the morning large enough to last us until noon, so impossible is it to pray in the morning in such a way as to last us until noon. Let your prayers ascend to Him constantly, audibly or silently, as circumstances throughout the day permit."
18881,"My praying friend, continue to make known your desires to God in all things. ... Let Him decide whether you are to receive what you ask for or not."

18886,
18887,"Music can move us to the heights or depths of emotion. It can persuade us to buy something, or remind us of our first date. It can lift us out of depression when nothing else can. It can get us dancing to its beat. But the power of music goes much, much further. Indeed, music occupies more areas of our brain than language does-humans are a musical species."
18888,"In examining disease, we gain wisdom about anatomy and physiology and biology. In examining the person with disease, we gain wisdom about life."
18889,"To live on a day-to-day basis is insufficient; we need to transcend, transport, escape; we need meaning, understanding, and explanation; we need to see over-all patterns in our lives. We need hope, the sense of a future; the freedom to get beyond ourselves...in states of mind that allow us to rise above our immediate surroundings and see the beauty and value of the world we live in."
18890,The power of music to integrate and cure. . . is quite fundamental. It is the profoundest nonchemical medication.
18891,"We see with the eyes, but we see with the brain as well. And seeing with the brain is often called imagination."
18892,"Above all, I have been a sentient being, a thinking animal, on this beautiful planet, and that in itself has been an enormous privilege and adventure."
18893,"If we wish to know about a man, we ask 'what is his story--his real, inmost story?'--for each of us is a biography, a story. Each of us is a singular narrative, which is constructed, continually, unconsciously, by, through, and in us--through our perceptions, our feelings, our thoughts, our actions; and, not least, our discourse, our spoken narrations. Biologically, physiologically, we are not so different from each other; historically, as narratives--we are each of us unique."
18894,"Every act of perception, is to some degree an act of creation, and every act of memory is to some degree an act of imagination."
18895,My religion is nature. That’s what arouses those feelings of wonder and mysticism and gratitude in me.
18896,"Music can lift us out of depression or move us to tears - it is a remedy, a tonic, orange juice for the ear. But for many of my neurological patients, music is even more - it can provide access, even when no medication can, to movement, to speech, to life. For them, music is not a luxury, but a necessity."
18897,"People will make a life in their own terms, whether they are deaf or colorblind or autistic or whatever. And their world will be quite as rich and interesting and full as our world."
18898,"We speak not only to tell other people what we think, but to tell ourselves what we think. Speech is a part of thought."
18899,"The brain is more than an assemblage of autonomous modules, each crucial for a specific mental function. Every one of these functionally specialized areas must interact with dozens or hundreds of others, their total integration creating something like a vastly complicated orchestra with thousands of instruments, an orchestra that conducts itself, with an ever-changing score and repertoire."
18900,Much more of the brain is devoted to movement than to language. Language is only a little thing sitting on top of this huge ocean of movement.
18901,There is only one cardinal rule: One must always listen to the patient.
18902,"If a man has lost a leg or an eye, he knows he has lost a leg or an eye; but if he has lost a self—himself—he cannot know it, because he is no longer there to know it."
18903,Music is...a fundamental way of expressing our humanity - and it is often our best medicine.
18904,"Music can lift us out of depression or move us to tears - it is a remedy, a tonic, orange juice for the ear."
18905,"Music has a bonding power, it's primal social cement"
18906,I regard music therapy as a tool of great power in many neurological disorders -- Parkinson's and Alzheimer's -- because of its unique capacity to organize or reorganize cerebral function when it has been damaged.
18907,"Music, uniquely among the arts, is both completely abstract and profoundly emotional. It has no power to represent anything particular or external, but it has a unique power to express inner states or feelings. Music can pierce the heart directly; it needs no mediation."
18908,"To be ourselves we must have ourselves – possess, if need be re-possess, our life-stories. We must “recollect” ourselves, recollect the inner drama, the narrative, of ourselves. A man needs such a narrative, a continuous inner narrative, to maintain his identity, his self."
18909,"Creativity involves the depth of a mind, and many, many depths of unconsciousness."
18910,"There is no one part of the brain which recognizes or responds emotionally to music. Instead, there are many different parts responding to different aspects of music: to pitch, to frequency, to timbre, to tonal intervals, to consonance, to dissonance, to rhythm, to melodic contour, to harmony."
18911,
18912,"Many people die with their music still in them. Why is this so? Too often it is because they are always getting ready to live. Before they know it, time runs out."

18926,"It is the province of knowledge to speak, and it is the privilege of wisdom to listen."
18927,Stupidity often saves a man from going mad.
18928,"Death tugs at my ear and says, 'Live. I am coming."
18929,"There is no friend like an old friend who has shared our morning days, no greeting like his welcome, no homage like his praise."
18930,I hate paying taxes. But I love the civilization they give me
18931,"We are all tattooed in our cradles with the beliefs of our tribe; the record may seem superficial, but it is indelible. You cannot educate a man wholly out of the superstitious fears which were early implanted in his imagination; no matter how utterly his reason may reject them..."
18932,A moment's insight is sometimes worth a life's experience.
18933,Civilization is the process of reducing the infinite to the finite.
18934,"Wisdom is the abstract of the past, but beauty is the promise of the future."

18938,The greatest act of faith is when a man understands he is not God.
18939,My right to swing my fist ends where your nose begins.
18940,"Success. Is not the position where you are standing, but which direction you are going."
18941,"I find the great thing in this world is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are moving: To reach the port of heaven, we must sail sometimes with the wind and sometimes against it, but we must sail, and not drift, nor lie at anchor."
18942,The mark of a civilized man is his willingness to re-examine his most cherished beliefs.
18943,"This is a court of law, not a court of justice."
18944,"If there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the principle of free thought, not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate."
18945,"Certitude leads to violence. This is a proposition that has an easy application and a difficult one. The easy application is to ideoologues, dogmatists, and bullies--people who think that their rigtness justifies them in imposing on anyone who does not happen to suscribe to their particular ideology, dogma or notion of turf. If the conviction of rightness is powerful enough, resistance to it will be met, sooner or later by force. There are people like this in every sphere of life, and it is natural to feel that the world would be a better place without them!"
18946,Even a dog distinguishes between being stumbled over and being kicked.
18947,"I like to pay taxes. With them, I buy civilization."
18948,"The history of intellectual growth and discovery clearly demonstrates the need for unfettered freedom, the right to think the unthinkable, discuss the unmentionable, and challenge the unchallengeable. To curtail free expression strikes twice at intellectual freedom, for whoever deprives another of the right to state unpopular views necessarily also deprives others of the right to listen to those views."
18949,Taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society.
18950,"Young men know the rules, but old men know the exceptions."
18951,"The man of action has the present, but the thinker controls the future."
18952,"If you don't know what you want, you will probably never get it."

18957,The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience.
18958,"A word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged; it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances and time in which it is used."
18959,"The best of a book is not the thought which it contains, but the thought which it suggests; just as the charm of music dwells not in the tones but in the echoes of our hearts."

18962,Amateurs study tactics; professionals study logistics.

For here death had been so fouled by degradation that it both stunned and numbed us."

18977,Amateurs talk strategy. Professionals talk logistics.

People will turn out to be the opposite of what you thought. Allah is perfect. His Messenger (peace be upon him) is a perfect example, and the religion is a perfect methodology. Attach yourself to the principles instead of the people. That way no Shaykh going wild or role model going rogue will be able to shake your faith."
18993,Wake up knowing that Allah is greater than any obstacle you may face today.
18994,One thing I've always struggled with in life is loving people too much. It's painful when that love is not reciprocated.

19009,Sometimes Allah gives you bitterness in this life so that you can further enjoy the sweetness of the hereafter.
19010,"Don't go into Ramadan having hurt anyone without seeking their forgiveness. The last thing you'd want on the day of judgment is to find that your entire Ramadan with all of its quran recitation, fasting, taraweeh prayers, laylatul qadr, etc. went completely to waste because your pride stopped you from saying “I'm sorry”. With that being said, I'm sorry if I've written, said, or done anything to offend you. Please find it in your heart to forgive and make dua that Allah grants me guidance and sincerity."

If it does not come, he remains where he is and dies, although the slightest effort would enable him to reach the waves, which are perhaps within a yard of him. The world is full of human lobsters; people stranded on the rocks of indecision and procrastination, who, instead of putting forth their own energies, are waiting for some grand billow of good fortune to set them afloat."

19091,"If you want to enlarge your life, you must first enlarge your thought of it and of yourself."
19092,"Self-Control is the very essence of character. To be able to look a man straight in the eye, calmly and deliberately, without the slightest ruffle of temper under extreme provocation, gives a sense of power which nothing else can give. To feel that you are always, not sometimes, master of yourself, gives a dignity and strength to character, buttresses it, supports it on every side, as nothing else can. This is the culmination of thought mastery."
19093,We lift ourselves by our own thought; we climb upon our vision of ourselves.

19114,"My theory is that everything went to hell with Prohibition, because it was a law nobody could obey. So the whole concept of the rule of law was corrupted at that moment. Then came Vietnam, and marijuana, which clearly shouldn't be illegal, but is. If you go to jail for ten years in Texas when you light up a joint, who are you? You're a lawbreaker.

The things we are going through are either making us sweeter, better, and nobler men and women, or they are making us more critical and fault-finding, and more insistent on our own way. The things that happen either make us evil, or they make us more saintly, depending entirely on our relationship with God and its level of intimacy."

Your part in intercessory prayer is not to agonize over how to intercede, but to use the everyday circumstances and people God puts around you by His providence to bring them before His throne, and to allow the Spirit in you the opportunity to intercede for them. In this way God is going to touch the whole world with His saints."

19188,"God never forces a person's will into surrender, and He never begs. He patiently waits until that person willingly yields to Him.

19195,"The real test of a saint is not one's willingness to preach the gospel, but one's willingness to do something like washing the disciples' feet - that is, being willing to do those things that seem unimportant in human estimation but count as everything to God."
19196,
19197,Any church that is not seriously involved in helping fulfill the Great Commission has forfeited its biblical right to exist.
19198,"We talk of the second coming, half the world has never heard of the first."
19199,"Oh my friends, we are loaded with countless church activities, while the real work of the church, that of evangelizing and winning the lost is almost entirely neglected."
19200,"I am perfectly confident that the man who does not spend hours alone with God will never know the anointing of the Holy Spirit. The world must be left outside until God alone fills the vision...God has promised to answer prayer. It is not that He is unwilling, for the fact is, He is more willing to give than we are to receive. But the trouble is, we are not ready..."
19201,"Oh, to realize that souls, precious, never dying souls, are perishing all around us, going out into the blackness of darkness and despair, eternally lost, and yet to feel no anguish, shed no tears, know no travail! How little we know of the compassion of Jesus!"
19202,"It matters not how spiritual a church may profess to be, if souls are not saved, something is radically wrong, and the professed spirituality is simply a false 
 experience, a delusion of the devil. People who are 
 satisfied to meet together simply to have a good time 
 among themselves are far away from God. Real 
 spirituality always has an outcome."
19203,The supreme task of the church is the evangelization of the world. No one has the right to hear the gospel twice until everyone has had an opportunity to hear it at least once.
19204,"Oh, how few find time for prayer! There is time for everything else, time to sleep and time to eat, time to read the newspaper and the novel, time to visit friends, time for everything else under the sun, but-no time for prayer, the most important of all things, the one great essential!"
19205,The church that does not evangelize will fossilize.
19206,"I want Thy plan, O God, for my life. May I be happy and contented whether in the homeland or on the foreign field; whether married or alone, in happiness or sorrow, health or sickness, prosperity or adversity -- I want Thy plan, O God, for my life. I want it; oh, I want it."
19207,The light that shines the farthest will shine the brightest at home.
19208,"The heart of the human problem, is the problem of the human heart."
19209,Our work is to preach the gospel and we must not be sidetracked.
19210,"The Lord did not tell us to build beautiful churches, but to evangelize the world"
19211,The mission of the church is missions.
19212,"In the Irish Revival of 1859, people became so weak that they 
could not get back to their homes. Men and women would fall by 
the wayside and would be found hours later pleading with God to 
save their souls. They felt that they were slipping into hell and that 
nothing else in life mattered but to get right with God... To them 
eternity meant everything. Nothing else was of any consequence. 
They felt that if God did not have mercy on them and save them, 
they were doomed for all time to come."
19213,"No one has the right to hear the gospel twice, while there remains someone who has not heard it once."
19214,"We all want to do the will of God, and we know that there is nothing nearer to His heart than the evangelization of the world."
19215,The only generation that can reach this generation is our generation.
19216,"Let me say that it is not a question of us getting more of the Holy Spirit, but rather of the Holy Spirit getting more of us."
19217,I have seen the vision and for self I cannot live; Life is less than worthless till my all I give.
19218,He who would preach powerfully must pray effectively.
19219,You must go or send a substitute.
19220,"If God wills the evangelization of the world, and you refuse to support missions, then you are opposed to the will of God."
19221,

His wants within the limits of his means."

19246,
19247,
19248,
19249,"I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close."
19250,"Love is not about property, diamonds and gifts. It is about sharing your very self with the world around you."
19251,
19252,"He who does not travel, who does not read, 
 who does not listen to music, 
 who does not find grace in himself, 
 she who does not find grace in herself, 
 dies slowly."
19253,"There is no insurmountable solitude. All paths lead to the same goal: to convey to others what we are. And we must pass through solitude and difficulty, isolation and silence in order to reach forth to the enchanted place where we can dance our clumsy dance and sing our sorrowful song - but in this dance or in this song there are fulfilled the most ancient rites of our conscience in the awareness of being human and of believing in a common destiny."
19254,In you is the illusion of each day. You arrive like the dew to the cupped flowers. You undermine the horizon with your absence. Eternally in flight like the wave.
19255,"In one kiss, you'll know all I haven't said."
19256,
19257,Every day you play with the light of the universe.
19258,"If each day falls 
 inside each night, 
 there exists a well 
 where clarity is imprisoned. 

 We need to sit on the rim 
 of the well of darkness 
 and fish for fallen light 
 with patience."
19259,"Of everything I have seen, it's you I want to go on seeing: of everything I've touched, it's your flesh I want to go on touching. I love your orange laughter. I am moved by the sight of you sleeping. What am I to do, love, loved one? I don't know how others love or how people loved in the past. I live, watching you, loving you. Being in love is my nature."
19260,"I love you between shadow and soul. I love you as the plant that hasn't bloomed yet, and carries hidden within itself the light of flowers. I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. Because of you, the dense fragrance that rises from the earth lives in my body, rioting with hunger for the eternity of our victorious kisses."
19261,Only a burning patience will lead to the attainment of a splendid happiness.
19262,so I wait for you like a lonely house till you will see me again and live in me. Till then my windows ache.
19263,As if you were on fire from within. The moon lives in the lining of your skin.
19264,Laughter is the language of the soul.
19265,"I have named you queen. There are taller than you, taller. There are purer than you, purer. There are lovelier than you, lovelier. But you are the queen."
19266,Your wide eyes are the only light I know from extinguished constellations.
19267,"To feel the affection that comes from those whom we do not know ... widens out the boundaries of our being, and unites all living things."
19268,"I will bring you flowers from the mountains, bluebells, dark hazels, and rustic baskets of kisses. I want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees."

19271,
19272,
19273,"Learn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist."
19274,The first half of life is learning to be an adult-the second half is learning to be a child.
19275,Everything you can imagine is real.
19276,Why do you try to understand art? Do you try to understand the song of a bird?
19277,
19278,"To know what you're going to draw, you have to begin drawing."
19279,Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.
19280,
19281,"If you know exactly what you're going to do, what's the good in doing 
 it?"
19282,Go and do the things you can't. That is how you get to do them.
19283,Art is lies that tell the truth.
19284,A plagiarist steals from one person. A true artist steals from everybody.
19285,"Our goals can only be reached through a vehicle of a plan, in which we must fervently believe, and upon which we must vigorously act. There is no other route to success."
19286,"I like all paintings. I always look at the paintings, good or bad, in barbershops, furniture stores, provincial hotels. I'm like a drinker who needs wine. As long as it is wine, it doesn't matter which wine."
19287,"...why did Plato say that poets should be chased out of the republic?  Precisely because every poet and every artist is an antisocial being.  He's not that way because he wants to be; he can't be any other way.... and if he really is an artist it is in his nature not to want to be admitted, because if he is admitted it can only mean he is doing something which is understood, approved, and therefore old hat - worthless.  Anything new, anything worth doing, can't be recognized."
19288,Computers are useless - all they can give you are answers.
19289,Without great solitude no serious work is possible.
19290,"Unless your work gives you trouble, it is no good."
19291,I do things I don't know how to do in order to learn how to do them.
19292,Music and art are the guiding lights of the world.
19293,"...art is something subversive.  It's something that should not be free.  Art and liberty, like the fire of Prometheus, are things that one must steal, to be used against the established order."
19294,Others have seen what is and asked why. I have seen what could be and asked why not.
19295,
19296,"Don't depend on death to liberate you from your imperfections. You are exactly the same after death as you were before. Nothing changes; you only give up the body. If you are a thief or a liar or a cheater before death, you don't become an angel merely by dying. If such were possible, then let us all go and jump in the ocean now and become angels at once! Whatever you have made of yourself thus far, so will you be hereafter. And when you reincarnate, you will bring that same nature with you. To change, you have to make the effort. This world is the place to do it."
19297,Change yourself and you have done your part in changing the world
19298,"If you want to be sad, no one in the world can make you happy. But if you make up your mind to be happy, no one and nothing on earth can take that happiness from you."
19299,"Millions of people never analyze themselves. Mentally they are mechanical products of the factory of their environment, preoccupied with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, working and sleeping, and going here and there to be entertained. They don't know what or why they are seeking, nor why they never realize complete happiness and lasting satisfaction. By evading self-analysis, people go on being robots, conditioned by their environment. True self-analysis is the greatest art of progress."
19300,"The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, worry about the future, or anticipate troubles, but to live in the present moment wisely and earnestly. . . Live each moment completely and the future will take care of itself. Fully enjoy the wonder and beauty of each moment."
19301,"Freedom means the power to act by soul guidance, not by the compulsions of desires and habits. Obeying the ego leads to bondage; obeying the soul brings liberation."

19307,"When the mind is calm, how quickly, how smoothly, how beautifully you will perceive everything."
19308,"We are all part of the One Spirit. When you experience the true meaning of religion, which is to know God, you will realize that He is your Self, and that He exists equally and impartially in all beings."
19309,"Mind is the creator of everything. You should therefore guide it to create only good. If you cling to a certain thought with dynamic will power, it finally assumes a tangible outward form. When you are able to employ your will always for constructive purposes, you become the controller of your destiny."
19310,"Most of the world is like a mental hospital. Some persons are sick with jealousy, others with anger, hatred, passion. They are victims of their habits and emotions. But you can make your home a place of peace."
19311,"It is not your passing thoughts or brilliant ideas so much as your plain everyday habits that control your life....Live simply. Don’t get caught in the machine of the world— it is too exacting. By the time you get what you are seeking your nerves are gone, the heart is damaged, and the bones are aching. Resolve to develop your spiritual powers more earnestly from now on. Learn the art of right living. If you have joy you have everything,so learn to be glad and contented....Have happiness now."
19312,"It doesn't matter if a cave has been in darkness for 10,000 years or half an hour, once you light a match it is illuminated."
19313,"If you have a strong mind and plant in it a firm resolve, you can change your destiny."
19314,"Do not take life's experiences too seriously. For in reality they are nothing but dream experiences. Play your part in life, but never forget that it is only a role."
19315,Be honest with yourself. The world is not honest with you. The world loves hypocrisy. When you are honest with yourself you find the road to inner peace.

19320,"The greatest romance is with the Infinite. 
 You have no idea how beautiful life can be. 
 When you suddenly find God everywhere, 
 when He comes and talks to you and guides you, 
 the romance of divine love has begun."
19321,
19322,Excellence is the gradual result of always striving to do better.
19323,"Excellence happens when you try each day to both do and be, a little better than you were yesterday!"
19324,"If you have a positive attitude and constantly strive to give your best effort, eventually you will overcome your immediate problems and find you are ready for greater challenges."
19325,"Shoulda, coulda, and woulda won't get it done. In attacking adversity, only a positive attitude, alertness, and regrouping to basics can launch a comeback."
19326,"Anytime you stop striving to get better, you're bound to get worse."
19327,"You have no choices about how you lose, but you do have a choice about how you come back and prepare to win again."
19328,"The key to teamwork is to learn a role, accept a role, and strive to become excellent playing it."
19329,Great players and great teams want to be driven. They want to be pushed to the edge. They don't want to be cheated. Ordinary players and average teams want it to be easy
19330,"All of us have at least one great voice deep inside. People are products of their environment. A lucky few are born into situations in which positive messages abound. Others grow up hearing messages of fear and failure, which they must block out so the positive can be heard. But the positive and courageous voice will always emerge, somewhere, sometime, for all of us. Listen for it, and your breakthroughs will come."
19331,"The most DIFFICULT thing for individuals to do when they become part of a team is to sacrifice, it is much EASIER to be selfish."
19332,The key to success is to learn to do something right and then do it right every time.
19333,Don't let other people tell you what you want.
19334,"I've learned to keep things simple.  Look at your choices, pick the best one, then go to work with all your heart."
19335,Being a part of success is more important than being personally indispensable.
19336,Any team can be a miracle team.  The catch is that you have got to go out and work for your miracles.  Effort is what ultimately separates great teams from ordinary teams.
19337,"In every adversity, there is a seed of equivalent benefit."
19338,The true warrior understands and seizes that moment by giving an effort so intense and so intuitive that it could only be called one from the heart.
19339,Great teamwork is the only way we create the breakthroughs that define our careers.
19340,"When you're playing against a stacked deck, compete even harder."
19341,We sometimes need adversity to fathom our true depths.
19342,Am I a control freak? No. Do I believe in organization? You bet. In discipline? In being on time and making sure everything at the hotel is ready and right? Definitely. I don't control players. I try to control the environment around the players so they can flourish.
19343,Management must speak with one voice. When it doesn't management itself becomes a peripheral opponent to the team's mission.
19344,It's what you get from games you lose that is extremely important.
19345,You can only receive what you're willing to give.
19346,"Bad men cannot make good citizens. It is when a people forget God that tyrants forge their chains. A vitiated state of morals, a corrupted public conscience, is incompatible with freedom. No free government, or the blessings of liberty, can be preserved to any people but by a firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue; and by a frequent recurrence to fundamental principles."
19347,
19348,"It is when a people forget God, that tyrants forge their chains."
19349,The militia is our ultimate safety. We can have no security without it. The great object is that every man be armed.
19350,
19351,[Our Constitution] is an instrument for the people to restrain the government.
19352,"Power is the great evil with which we are contending. We have divided power between three branches of government and erected checks and balances to prevent abuse of power. However, where is the check on the power of the judiciary? If we fail to check the power of the judiciary, I predict that we will eventually live under judicial tyranny."
19353,"My most cherished possession I wish I could leave you is my faith in Jesus Christ, for with Him and nothing else you can be happy, but without Him and with all else you'll never be happy."
19354,"You ought to be extremely cautious, watchful, jealous of your liberty; for instead of securing your rights, you may lose them forever."
19355,"Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings."
19356,"It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, “Peace! Peace!” — but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!"
19357,"Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are inevitably ruined."
19358,"Are we at last brought to such humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our defense? Where is the difference between having our arms in possession and under our direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?"
19359,"I know not what others may choose but, as for me, give me liberty or give me death."
19360,Fear is the passion of slaves.
19361,Human nature will never part with power. Look for an example of a voluntary relinquishment of power from one end of the globe to another - you will find none.
19362,"Show me that age and country where the rights and liberties of the people were placed on the sole chance of their rulers being good men, without a consequent loss of liberty?"
19363,The Bible is worth all the other books which have ever been printed.
19364,"Were my soul trembling on the wing of eternity, were this hand freezing to death, were my voice choking with the last struggle, I would still, with the last gasp of that voice, implore you to remember the truth: God has given America to be free."
19365,"If you have given up your militia, and Congress shall refuse to arm them, you have lost every thing. Your existence will be precarious, because you depend on others, whose interests are not affected by your infelicity."
19366,"The officers of Congress, may come upon you now, fortified with all the terrors of paramount federal authority. Excisemen taxmen may come in multitudes; for the limitation of their numbers no man knows. They may, unless the general government be restrained ... go into your cellars and rooms, and search, ransack, and measure, everything you eat, drink, and wear."
19367,The people have a right to keep and bear arms.
19368,"Bad men cannot make good citizens. A vitiated state of morals, a corrupted public conscience are incompatible with freedom."
19369,I shall act as I think my duty requires.
19370,"Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation, that we cannot be trusted with arms for our defense?"
19371,
19372,Everything in your life can change except ONE: your passion
19373,"God's decisions are always mysterious, but they are always in our favour."
19374,Leave your comfortable life and go in search of your kingdom.
19375,Certain things are so important that they need to be discovered  alone.
19376,"Try to live with the same intensity as a child. He doesn't ask for explanations; he dives into each day as if it were a new adventure and, at night, sleeps tired and happy."
19377,"If you are honest, people may cheat you. Be honest anyway."
19378,"But in the end all religions point to the same light. In between the light and us, sometimes there are too many rules. The light is here and there are no rules to follow this light."
19379,"In order to have faith in his own path, he does not need to prove that someone else's path is wrong."
19380,A life without a cause is a life without effect.
19381,"Our life is a constant journey, from birth to death. The landscape changes, the people change, our needs change, but the train keeps moving. Life is the train, not the station."
19382,
19383,You are not defeated when you lose. You are defeated when you quit.
19384,"We must struggle for our dreams, but when certain paths prove impossible, it would be best to save our energies in order to travel other roads."
19385,"May love fill your heart, compassion guide your mind, faith rule your soul."

19391,"If you don't care about what people think, you already passed the first step of success."
19392,Impossible is just an opinion.
19393,"Certainly. But take this into consideration: of every ten problems we have, nine are created by our own selves - through guilt, self-punishment, self-pity. However, from time to time a great obstacle appears in our path, which was put there by God, and which is there for a reason. The reason is: to give us the opportunity to change everything, to move forwards."
19394,"Love is an act of faith, not an exchange"
19395,"Of all the ways we have found to hurt ourselves, the worse has been through love. We are always suffering because of someone who doesn't love us, or someone who has left us, or someone who won't leave us. If we are alone, it is because no one wants us."
19396,
19397,Many people lose the small joys in the hope for the big happiness.
19398,To find joy in work is to discover the fountain of youth.
19399,"Love cannot be forced, love cannot be coaxed and teased. It comes out of heaven, unasked and unsought."
19400,Exclusion is always dangerous. Inclusion is the only safety if we are to have a peaceful world.

19405,The secret of joy in work is contained in one word - excellence. To know how to do something well is to enjoy it.
19406,"Only the brave should teach....Teaching is a vocation. It is as sacred as priesthood; as innate a desire, as inescapable as the genius which compels a great artist. If he has not the concern for humanity, the love of living creatures, the vision of the priest and the artist, he must not teach."
19407,"All things are possible until they are proved impossible - and even the impossible may only be so, as of now."
19408,"The truly creative mind in any field is no more than this: A human creature born abnormally, inhumanly sensitive. To him... a touch is a blow, a sound is a noise, a misfortune is a tragedy, a joy is an ecstasy, a friend is a lover, a lover is a god, and failure is death."
19409,"If you want to understand today, you have to search yesterday."
19410,Life is the wonder with which we are all infused.
19411,"To serve is beautiful, but only if it is done with joy and a whole heart and a free mind."

19413,To know how to do something well is to enjoy it.
19414,"The boundary between civilization and barbarism is difficult to draw: put one ring in your nose and you are a savage, put two rings in your ears and you are civilized."
19415,Some of the biggest failures I ever had were successes.
19416,"Integrity is honesty carried through the fibres of the being and the whole mind, into thought as well as action so that the person is complete in honesty. That kind of integrity I put above all else as an essential to leadership."
19417,You can judge your age by the amount of pain you feel when you come in contact with a new idea.
19418,"I do not believe in a child world. It is a fantasy world. I believe the child should be taught from the very first that the whole world is his world, that adult and child share one world, that all generations are needed."
19419,It is good to know our universe. What is new is only new to us.
19420,A foreigner is a friend I have yet to meet.

19425,There is always someone out there getting better than you by training harder than you.

19428,
19429,"A lot of people, when a guy scores a lot of goals, think, 'He's a great player', because a goal is very important, but a great player is a player who can do everything on the field. He can do assists, encourage his colleagues, give them confidence to go forward. It is someone who, when a team does not do well, becomes one of the leaders."
19430,The head talks to the heart and the heart talks to the feet.
19431,"I love people. I wanted to be with the people. I wanted to give something back what I get from football, because God gave everything to me."

19436,"If I pass away one day, I am happy because I tried to do my best. My sport allowed me to do so much because it's the biggest sport in the world."
19437,Most important is be a good man.
19438,"Everything on earth is a game. A passing thing. We all end up dead. We all end up the same, don't we?"
19439,"Football is like a religion to me. I worship the ball, and I treat it like a god. Too many players think of a football as something to kick. They should be taught to caress it and to treat it like a precious gem."
19440,Enthusiasm is everything. It must be taut and vibrating like a guitar string.
19441,"I think the kids always they look forward to be always the big stars. Not only football, any profession. They want to be the best, singer, they want to be the best political, only the stars. But I think sometime the life give you opportunity, and long to be a big star, but you don't need to be a big star, you need to be beautiful, excellent man. Human being. This is the first."
19442,I want to do my best to make the people happy. I play with my heart for the sport.
19443,"Nelson Mandela was one of the most influential people in my life. He was my hero, my friend, and also a companion to me in our fight for the people and for world peace. Let us all continue his legacy with purpose and passion."
19444,When you control the ball you control the score
19445,"When you play against dirty players or very tough players, it's easy to escape because you know what they're going to do. But when the player is tough but intelligent, it's much more difficult."
19446,
19447,It's a transformative experience to simply pause instead of immediately filling up space.
19448,Loving kindness towards ourselves doesn't mean getting rid of anything. It means we can still be crazy after all these years. We can still be angry after all these years. We can still be timid or jealous or full of feelings of unworthiness. The point is not to try to throw ourselves away and become something better. It's about befriending who we are already.
19449,Be kinder to yourself. And then let your kindness flood the world.
19450,You are the sky. Everything else - it’s just the weather.
19451,"The next time you lose heart and you can’t bear to experience what you’re feeling, you might recall this instruction: change the way you see it and lean in. Instead of blaming our discomfort on outer circumstances or on our own weakness, we can choose to stay present and awake to our experience, not rejecting it, not grasping it, not buying the stories that we relentlessly tell ourselves. This is priceless advice that addresses the true cause of suffering—yours, mine, and that of all living beings."
19452,Let your curiosity be greater than your fear.
19453,"Not causing harm requires staying awake. Part of being awake is slowing down enough to notice what we say and do. The more we witness our emotional chain reactions and understand how they work, the easier it is to refrain. It becomes a way of life to stay awake, slow down, and notice."
19454,"I can't overestimate the importance of accepting ourselves exactly as we are right now, not as we wish we were or think we ought to be."
19455,All you need to know is that the future is wide open and you are about to create it by what you do.
19456,"Times are difficult globally; awakening is no longer a luxury or an ideal. It’s becoming critical. We don’t need to add more depression, more discouragement, or more anger to what’s already here. It’s becoming essential that we learn how to relate sanely with difficult times. The earth seems to be beseeching us to connect with joy and discover our innermost essence. This is the best way that we can benefit others."
19457,It isn't what happens to us that causes us to suffer; it's what we say to ourselves about what happens.
19458,One of the deepest habitual patterns that we have is to feel that now is not enough.
19459,"Each time you stay present with fear and uncertainty, you're letting go of a habitual way of finding security and comfort."
19460,"Difficult things provoke all your irritations and bring your habitual patterns to the surface.  And that becomes the moment of truth.  You have the choice to launch into your lousy habitual patterns, or to stay with the rawness and discomfort of the situation and let it transform you."
19461,"What you do for yourself, any gesture of kindness, any gesture of gentleness, any gesture of honesty and clear seeing toward yourself, will affect how you experience your world. In fact, it will transform how you experience the world. What you do for yourself, you’re doing for others, and what you do for others, you’re doing for yourself."
19462,"Deep down in the human spirit, there is a reservoir of courage. It is always available, always waiting to be discovered."
19463,"This moving away from comfort and security, this stepping out into what is unknown, uncharted and shaky - that's called liberation."
19464,"You build inner strength through embracing the totality of your experience, both the delightful parts and the difficult parts."
19465,Feel the feelings and drop the story.
19466,Things falling apart is a kind of testing and also a kind of healing.
19467,"We work on ourselves in order to help others, but also we help others in order to work on ourselves."
19468,There's nothing more important on our spiritual path than developing gentleness to oneself.
19469,"Whatever happens in your life, joyful or painful, do not be swept away by reactivity. Be patient with yourself and don't lose your sense of perspective."
19470,"When we resist change, it’s called suffering. But when we can completely let go and not struggle against it, when we can embrace the groundlessness of our situation and relax into it’s dynamic quality, that’s called enlightenment"
19471,
19472,Songs are funny things. They can slip across borders. Proliferate in prisons. Penetrate hard shells. I always believed that the right song at the right moment could change history.
19473,It's a very important thing to learn to talk to people you disagree with.
19474,Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't.
19475,"And when one person taps out a beat, while another leads into the melody, or when three people discover a harmony they never knew existed, or a crowd joins in on a chorus as though to raise the ceiling a few feet higher, then they also know there is hope for the world."
19476,I want to turn the clock back to when people lived in small villages and took care of each other.

19480,The first step in solving a problem is admitting there is a problem to be solved.
19481,"I feel most spiritual when I'm out in the woods. I feel part of nature. Or looking up at the stars. [I used to say] I was an atheist. Now I say, it's all according to your definition of God. According to my definition of God, I'm not an atheist. Because I think God is everything. Whenever I open my eyes I'm looking at God."
19482,"I tell kids, don't trust the media. The media with their emphasis on fame is helping to destroy this country, helping destroy the human race. It's the plug-in drug."
19483,"If there's a world here in a hundred years, it's going to be saved by tens of millions of little things.  The powers-that-be can break up any big thing they want.  They can corrupt it or co-opt it from the inside, or they can attack it from the outside.  But what are they going to do about 10 million little things?  They break up two of them, and three more like them spring up!"
19484,"Shh. Listen to the sounds that surround you. Notice the pitches, the volume, the timbre, the many lines of counterpoint. As light taught Monet to paint, the earth may be teaching you music."
19485,"Every time I'm in the woods, i feel like I'm in church."
19486,The easiest way to avoid wrong notes is to never open your mouth and sing. What a mistake that would be.
19487,A productive mistake is: (1) made in the service of mission and vision; (2) acknowledged as a mistake; (3) learned from; (4) considered valuable; (5) shared for the benefit of all.
19488,"This world is so full of hypocrisy, the only way you can be honest is to be a hermit."
19489,"I'm not sure if my involvement in causes, benefits, marches, and demonstrations has made a huge difference, but I know one thing: that involvement has connected me with the good people: people with the live hearts, the live eyes, the live heads."
19490,"I still call myself a communist, because communism is no more what Russia made of it than Christianity is what the churches make of it."
19491,"And there's a wonderful parable in the New Testament: The sower scatters seeds. Some seeds fall in the pathway and get stamped on, and they don't grow. Some fall on the rocks, and they don't grow. But some seeds fall on fallow ground, and they grow and multiply a thousandfold. Who knows where some good little thing that you've done may bring results years later that you never dreamed of?"
19492,"The American Indians were Communists. They were. Every anthropologist will tell you they were Communists. No rich, no poor. If somebody needed something the community chipped in."

19504,
19505,The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn't said.
19506,"Cultivate a deep understanding of yourself - not only what your strengths and weaknesses are but also how you learn, how you work with others, what your values are, and where you can make the greatest contribution. Because only when you operate from strengths can you achieve true excellence."
19507,The only skill that will be important in the 21st century is the skill of learning new skills.Everythi ng else will become obsolete over time.
19508,There is nothing worse than doing the wrong thing well.
19509,"The leaders who work most effectively, it seems to me, never say ""I."" And that's not because they have trained themselves not to say ""I."" They don't think ""I."" They think ""we""; they think ""team."" They understand their job to be to make the team function. They accept responsibility and don't sidestep it, but ""we"" gets the credit. This is what creates trust, what enables you to get the task done."
19510,Doing the right thing is more important than doing the thing right.
19511,Most leaders don't need to learn what to do. They need to learn what to stop.
19512,The most common source of mistakes in management decisions is the emphasis on finding the right answer rather than the right question.
19513,The key to greatness is to look for people's potential and spend time developing it.

19515,

19518,"Successful careers are not planned. They develop when people are prepared for opportunities because they know their strengths, their method of work, and their values. Knowing where one belongs can transform an ordinary person - hardworking and competent but otherwise mediocre - into an outstanding performer."
19519,"One cannot buy, rent or hire more time. The supply of time is totally inelastic. No matter how high the demand, the supply will not go up. There is no price for it. Time is totally perishable and cannot be stored. Yesterday's time is gone forever, and will never come back. Time is always in short supply. There is no substitute for time. Everything requires time. All work takes place in, and uses up time. Yet most people take for granted this unique, irreplaceable and necessary resource."
19520,The only real difference between one organization and another is the performance of its people.
19521,
19522,
19523,"The choice before us is plain: Christ or chaos, conviction or compromise, discipline or disintegration. I am rather tired of hearing about our rights and privileges as Americans.

But why not take the Pilot on board who knows the nature of your sealed orders from the outset, and who will shape your entire voyage accordingly? He knows the shoals and the sand banks, the rocks and the reefs, He will steer you safely into that celestial harbor where your anchor will be cast for eternity. Let His almighty nail-pierced hands hold the wheel, and you will be safe."

19531,Most of us know perfectly well what we ought to do; our trouble is that we do not want to do it.
19532,"No tabloid will ever print the startling news that the mummified body of Jesus of Nazareth has been discovered in old Jerusalem. Christians have no carefully embalmed body enclosed in a glass case to worship. Thank God, we have an empty tomb. The glorious fact that the empty tomb proclaims to us is that life for us does not stop when death comes. Death is not a wall, but a door."
19533,"Let us not fool ourselves - without Christianity, without Christian education, without the principles of Christ inculcated into young life, we are simply rearing pagans."

19535,"If God does not enter your kitchen, there is something wrong with your kitchen. If you can't take God into your recreation, there is something wrong with your play. We all believe in the God of the heroic. What we need most these days is the God of the humdrum, the commonplace, the everyday."
19536,"Above all, we should question the consumer ethic, which uses up non-renewable resources, creates inequality and injustice, generates pollution, destroys other species and upsets the balance of nature. The consumer ethic not only defiles the environment by creating undesirable change in the biosphere but also corrupts the mind and body by defining pleasure in terms of ownership and absorption. Waste itself is a human concept; everything in nature is eventually used. If human beings carry on in their present ways, they will one day be recycled along with the dinosaurs."
19537,It is better to fail in a cause that will ultimately succeed than to succeed in a cause that will ultimately fail.
19538,"God hasn't given up on you. He can still do great things for you, in you, and through you. God is ready and waiting and able. What about you, and me?"
19539,The proof of how real Jesus knew hell to be is that He came to earth to save us from it.
19540,"We pray Thee, O Christ, to keep us under the spell of immortality. My we never again think and act as if Thou were dead. Let us more and more come to know Thee as a living Lord who hath promised to them that believe: ""Because I live, ye shall live also."" Help us to remember that we are praying to the Conqueror of Death, that we may no longer be afraid nor dismayed by the world's problems and threats, since Thou hast overcome the world. In Thy strong name, we ask for Thy living presence and Thy victorious power. Amen."
19541,"The modern challenge to motherhood is the eternal challenge--that of being a godly woman. The very phrase sounds strange in our ears. We never hear it now. We hear about every other type of women: beautiful women, smart women, sophisticated women, career women, talented women, divorced women. But so seldom to we hear of a godly woman--or of a godly man either, for that matter. I believe women come nearer to fulfilling their God-given function in the home than anywhere else."
19542,The resurrection never becomes a fact of experience until the risen Lord lives in the heart of the believer.
19543,Give according to your income lest God make your income according to your giving.

19545,"Teach us, O Lord, the disciplines of patience, for to wait is often harder than to work."
19546,
19547,"Two of the central ingredients to our family are food and faith, so sitting down together and thanking God for the food He's provided means everything to us. Prayer is a natural part of our lives - not only around the dinner table but all day long."
19548,"My mission today is to go forth and tell people about why I follow Christ and also what the bible teaches, and part of that teaching is that women and men are meant to be together."

19552,Women are a lot like ducks-they don’t like mud on their butts.
19553,Jesus Christ was the most perfect being to ever walk this planet and he was persecuted and nailed to the cross … so please don’t be surprised when we get a little static.
19554,"I myself am a product of the 60s; I centered my life around sex, drugs and rock and roll until I hit rock bottom and accepted Jesus as my Savior. My mission today is to go forth and tell people about why I follow Christ and also what the Bible teaches, and part of that teaching is that women and men are meant to be together. However, I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me. We are all created by the Almighty and like Him, I love all of humanity. We would all be better off if we loved God and loved each other."
19555,I guess the GOP may be more desperate than I thought to call somebody like me.
19556,"If you provide the drive, dream, and vision, with God’s help, you can accomplish anything."
19557,Women with whiskers... its a bummer.

19560,"I love all men and women. I am a lover of humanity, not a hater. … I have been immoral, drunk, high. I ran with the wicked people for 28 years and I have run with the Jesus people since and the contrast is astounding."
19561,"We never, ever judge someone on who's going to heaven, hell. That's the Almighty's job."
19562,"Everything is blurred on what's right and what's wrong ... Sin becomes fine. Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men. Don't be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers - they won't inherit the kingdom of God."
19563,"Where there is no Jesus, evil always reigns."

19567,"I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I'm with the blacks, because we're white trash. We're going across the field.... They're singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, I tell you what: These doggone white people - not a word!... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues."

19830,"I believe that if we want our children to understand the world beyond their classroom, we must bring the world into their classroom."
19831,"When you educate a girl, you kick-start a cycle of success. It makes economic sense. It makes social sense. It makes moral sense. But, it seems, it's not common sense yet."
19832,"We look at problems happening halfway across the world and we think, 'Well, that's their problem.' But it's not. ... When you solve somebody else's problem, you're solving a problem for yourself because our world today is so interconnected."
19833,I don't believe there is a clash between cultures. I believe there is a clash between perceptions of each other.
19834,We shouldn't judge people through the prism of our own stereotypes.
19835,Children keep us in check. Their laughter prevents our hearts from hardening. Their dreams ensure we never lose our drive to make ours a better world. They are the greatest disciplinarians known to mankind.

19839,"My role models are people who can do things; I say to myself, ""I wish I could do that."" Like women who endure hardships and turn their luck around and bring up children on their own and start a business. Or a social worker who leaves his country, his comfort, his friends, and goes far away to help people he doesn't know. I want to evolve into that, ultimately. I want to be that person who could sacrifice everything for others."
19840,"We always say Jordan is not rich in natural resources - we don't have oil or gas like some of our neighbors do - but I think in terms of human resources, we are quite lucky and we are really trying to foster an environment of innovation and technology. I think Jordan will emerge as a center of innovation in the Middle East."

19842,"It's about using social media for social change: creating a community of advocates who can use their voices on behalf of the voiceless, or leverage their talents, skills, knowledge, and resources to put more children into classrooms, or pressure their elected representatives to get global education top of the agenda."
19843,Travelers are the greatest ambassadors of tolerance.

19852,"Beware of artists, they mix with all classes of society and are therefore most dangerous."

19854,Nothing will turn a man's home into a castle more quickly and effectively than a dachshund.
19855,"Since it has pleased Providence to place me in this station, I shall do my utmost to fulfil my duty towards my country; I am very young and perhaps in many, though not in all things, inexperienced, but I am sure that very few have more real good will and more real desire to do what is fit and right than I have."
19856,Great events make me quiet and calm; it is only trifles that irritate my nerves.
19857,"My dearest dearest dear Albert sat on a footstool by my side and his excessive love and affection gave me feelings of heavenly love and happiness I never could have hoped to have felt before! He clasped me in his arms and we kissed each other again and again! His beauty... his sweetness and gentleness - really how can I ever be thankful enough to have such a husband! to be called names of tenderness, I have never yet heard used to me before - was bliss beyond belief! Oh! This was the happiest day of my life! May God help me to do my duty as I ought and be worthy of such blessings."
19858,I positively think that ladies who are always enceinte quite disgusting; it is more like a rabbit or guinea-pig than anything else and really it is not very nice.

19860,"That Book, the Bible, accounts for the supremacy of England. England has become great & happy by the knowledge of the true God through Jesus Christ."

19862,"I don't dislike babies, though I think very young ones rather disgusting."
19863,Bring me a cup of tea and the 'Times.'
19864,"The Queen is most anxious to enlist everyone in checking this mad, wicked folly of 'Women's Rights'. It is a subject which makes the Queen so furious that she cannot contain herself."

19866,Being pregnant is an occupational hazard of being a wife.
19867,"A marriage is no amusement but a solemn act, and generally a sad one."
19868,"The greatest maxim of all is that children should be brought up as simply and in as domestic a way as possible, and that (not interfering with their lessons) they should be as much as possible with their parents, and learn to place the greatest confidence in them in all things."
19869,She was such a beautiful and sweet creature... and so full of tricks.

19871,

19880,"Mainstream people dislike homosexuality because they can't help concentrating on what homosexual men do to one another. And when you contemplate what people do, you think of yourself doing it. And they don't like that. That's the famous joke: I don't like peas, and I'm glad I don't like them, because if I liked them I would eat them and I hate them."
19881,I lost the love of all the homosexuals in the world by saying that Princess Diana was trash and got what she deserved. She could have been Queen of England - and she was swanning about Paris with Arabs. What disgraceful behavior. Going about saying she wanted to be the queen of hearts. The vulgarity of it is so overpowering.
19882,"If you describe things as better than they are, you are considered to be a romantic; if you describe things as worse than they are, you will be called a realist; and if you describe things exactly as they are, you will be thought of as a satirist."
19883,It's been agony but I couldn't have done it any other way.
19884,"Believe in fate, but lean forward where fate can see you."
19885,"When I was young, I and the whole world thought that all homosexuals were effeminate. And of course they're not. You can just see which people are effeminate; that's the only difference. So, I became a prototype of the effeminate man, because I was conspicuously effeminate. But camp is not something I do, it's something I am."
19886,The trouble with children is that they're not returnable.
19887,To live in the past is to miss today's opportunities and tomorrow's blessings.
19888,There are three reasons for becoming a writer: the first is that you need the money; the second that you have something to say that you think the world should know; the third is that you can't think what to do with the long winter evenings.
19889,"No effort is required to define or even attain happiness, but enormous concentration is needed to abandon everything else."

19896,

 peace."

19902,"Some have immersed themselves in internet materials that magnify, exaggerate, and in some cases invent shortcomings of early Church leaders. Then they draw incorrect conclusions that can affect testimony. Any who have made these choices can repent and be spiritually renewed."
19903,Some build their sense of personal worth by comparing themselves to others. That approach can lead to feelings of inadequacy or superiority. It is preferable to look directly to our Father for our sense of self-worth.
19904,Live by faith and not by fear.
19905,"Our women are not incredible because they have managed to avoid the difficulties of life—quite the opposite. They are incredible because of the way they face the trials of life. Despite the challenges and tests life has to offer—from marriage or lack of marriage, children’s choices, poor health, lack of opportunities, and many other problems—they remain remarkably strong and immovable and true to the faith. Our sisters throughout the Church consistently “succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees."

19909,"One of the remarkable characteristics of young wild sunflowers, in addition to growing in soil that is not hospitable, is how the young flower bud follows the sun across the sky. In doing so, it receives life-sustaining energy before bursting forth in its glorious yellow color. 
 Like the young sunflower, when we follow the Savior of the world, the Son of God, we flourish and become glorious despite the many terrible circumstances that surround us. He truly is our light and life."
19910,"The Savior accomplished the Atonement, which resolves the most terrible burdens that can occur in this life."
19911,"Peace is not just safety or lack of war, violence, conflict and contention. Peace comes from knowing that the Savior knows who we are, knows that we have faith in Him, love Him, and keep His commandments, even and especially amid life's devastating trials and tragedies."
19912,"If the grim realities you are facing at this time seem dark and heavy and almost unbearable, remember that in the soul-wrenching darkness of Gethsemane and the incomprehensible torture and pain of Calvary, the Savior accomplished the Atonement, which resolves the most terrible burdens that can occur in this life. He did it for you, and He did it for me. He did it because He loves us and because He obeys and loves His Father. We will be rescued from death-even from the depths of the sea."

19926,"To me, torture would be watching sports on television."
19927,"Sure, Kill Bill is a violent movie. But it's a Tarantino movie. You don't go to see Metallica and ask the fuckers to turn the music down."
19928,The good ideas will survive.
19929,"I steal from every single movie ever made. I love it - if my work has anything it's that I'm taking this from this and that from that and mixing them together. If people don't like that, then tough titty, don't go and see it, all right? I steal from everything. Great artists steal; they don't do homages."
19930,"If the film is nominated for awards, and even if it wins them, it doesn't make the movie any better, just as if it's ignored that doesn't make the movie any worse."

19937,My plan is to have a theatre in some small town or something and I'll be manager. Ill be the crazy old movie guy.
19938,"Music is very, very important in my movies. In some ways the most important stage, whether it ends up being in the movie or not, is just when I come up with the idea itself before I have actually sat down and started writing. I go into my record room... I have a big vinyl collection and I have a room kind of set up like a used record store and I just dive into my music, whether it be rock music, or lyric music, or my soundtrack collection. What I'm looking for is the spirit of the movie, the beat that the movie will play with."
19939,"One thing I don't understand is that average American movie-goers cannot watch a movie for three hours, yet they'll watch a stupid, boring, horrific football game for four hours. Now, that is boredom at its most colossal."
19940,"To me, movies and music go hand in hand. When I'm writing a script, one of the first things I do is find the music I'm going to play for the opening sequence."
19941,"If you just love movies enough, you can make a good one."
19942,"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides
 By the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
 Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will,
 Shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
 For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.
 And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger
 Those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.
 And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee."
19943,"Violence is fun, man."
19944,"To be a novelist, all I need is a pen and a piece of paper."
19945,I'm very happy with the way I write. I think I do it good. But I've never really considered myself a writer.

19947,"Excellence isn't an act, it's a habit"

19949,"I learned real early why God gave us two ears and one mouth, because you're supposed to listen twice as much as you talk."
19950,The process is the most beautiful part.
19951,Let's not get too full of ourselves. Let's leave space for God to come into the room.
19952,"Music was the one thing I could control. It was the one world that offered me freedom. When I played music, my nightmares ended. My family problems disappeared. I didnt have to search for answers. The answers lay no further than the bell of my trumpet and my scrawled, pencilled scores. Music made me full, strong, popular, self-reliant and cool."
19953,"Imagine what a harmonious world it could be if every single person, both young and old shared a little of what he is good at doing."
19954,"I've been driven all my life by a spirit of adventure and a criminal level of optimism. I believed in my dreams because they were my only option.

19959,"It's the attitude about life, man. Looking at the light instead of the dark. Looking at love instead of fear."
19960,"The people who make it to the top - whether they're musicians, or great chefs, or corporate honchos - are addicted to their calling ... [they] are the ones who'd be doing whatever it is they love, even if they weren't being paid."
19961,"There’s nothing in the world worse than having an opportunity that you’re not prepared for. Good luck usually follows the collision of opportunity and preparation - it’s a result of that collision. You’ve got to be prepared. So, make your mistakes now and make them quickly. If you’ve made the mistakes, you know what to expect the next time. That’s how you become valuable."

19970,You have to know that your real home is within.
19971,
19972,"Most of the homeschooled children I know have about the same amount of after-school peer time as the rest of the population but, obviously, without that school day together, they do spend less time with their peers. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing is still open to debate."
19973,"All the homeschooling parents I know meet on a regular basis with other families. They organize field trips, cooking classes, reading clubs and Scout troops. Their children tend to be happy, confident and socially engaged."
19974,"The process of socialization is nowhere near complete at age five or six, when modern children start spending up to half their waking hours taking their cues from other people's children. Because they accompany their parents' daily routine, homeschooled kids spend plenty of time interacting with people of all ages, which I think most people would agree is a far more natural, organic way to socialize."

19984,"Those who wish to appear wise among fools, among the wise seem foolish."
19985,"In almost everything, experience is more valuable than precept."
19986,A great part of art consists in imitation. For the whole conduct of life is based on this: that what we admire in others we want to do ourselves.
19987,A laugh costs too much when bought at the expense of virtue.
19988,"Prune what is turgid, elevate what is commonplace, arrange what is disorderly, introduce rhythm where the language is harsh, modify where it is too absolute."

20024,"To later Romans Ennius was the personification of the spirit of early Rome; by them he was called ""The Father of Roman Poetry."" We must remember how truly Greek he was in his point of view. He set the example for later Latin poetry by writing the first epic of Rome in Greek hexameter verses instead of in the old Saturnian verse. He made popular the doctrines of Euhemerus, and he was in general a champion of free thought and rationalism."
20025,"Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue.

20262,"I began to realize how important it was to be an enthusiast in life. He taught me that if you are interested in something, no matter what it is, go at it at full speed ahead. Embrace it with both arms, hug it, love it and above all become passionate about it. Lukewarm is no good. Hot is no good either. White hot and passionate is the only thing to be"
20263,"The more risks you allow your children to make, the better they learn to look after themselves."
20264,Watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you.
20265,Don't gobblefunk around with words.
20266,You'll never get anywhere if you go about what-iffing like that.
20267,"I was glad my father was an eye-smiler. It meant he never gave me a fake smile, because it's impossible to make your eyes twinkle if you aren't feeling twinkly yourself. A mouth-smile is different. You can fake a mouth-smile any time you want, simply by moving your lips. I've also learned that a real mouth-smile always has an eye-smile to go with it, so watch out, I say, when someone smiles at you with his mouth but the eyes stay the same. It's sure to be bogus."
20268,Having power is not nearly as important as what you choose to do with it.
20269,"So, please, oh please, we beg, we pray, go throw your TV set away, and in its place you can install, a lovely bookcase on the wall."

20274,"No book ever ends, when it's full of your friends."
20275,"Secrecy is the keystone to all tyranny. Not force, but secrecy and censorship. When any government or church for that matter, undertakes to say to its subjects, ""This you may not read, this you must not know,"" the end result is tyranny and oppression, no matter how holy the motives. Mighty little force is needed to control a man who has been hoodwinked in this fashion; contrariwise, no amount of force can control a free man, whose mind is free. No, not the rack nor the atomic bomb, not anything. You can't conquer a free man; the most you can do is kill him."
20276,"A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects."
20277,"[T]here seems to have been an actual decline in rational thinking. The United States had become a place where entertainers and professional athletes were mistaken for people of importance. They were idolized and treated as leaders; their opinions were sought on everything and they took themselves just as seriously-after all, if an athlete is paid a million or more a year, he knows he is important ... so his opinions of foreign affairs and domestic policies must be important, too, even though he proves himself to be ignorant and subliterate every time he opens his mouth."
20278,You can sway a thousand men by appealing to their prejudices quicker than you can convince one man by logic.
20279,"It is a bad sign when the people of a country stop identifying themselves with the country and start identifying with a group. A racial group. Or a religion. Or a language. Anything, as long as it isn't the whole population."
20280,"I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do."
20281,"Political tags - such as royalist, communist, democrat, populist, fascist, liberal, conservative, and so forth - are never basic criteria. The human race divides politically into those who want people to be controlled and those who have no such desire."
20282,"Love your country, but never trust its government."
20283,Democracy can survive anything except Democrats
20284,"Ignorance is curable, stupid is forever."
20285,"A dying culture invariably exhibits personal rudeness. Bad manners. Lack of consideration for others in minor matters. A loss of politeness, of gentle manners, is more significant than is a riot."
20286,Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity. Never underestimate the power of human stupidity.
20287,The lessons of history teach us - if the lessons of history teach us anything - that nobody learns the lessons that history teaches us.
20288,"Patriotism is not 'my country right or wrong'; patriotism means loving the ideals for which America stands and having the courage to speak up when these ideals are distorted for personal or political gain. The American government was instituted to be the servant of the people, not our master."
20289,No statement should be believed because it is made by an authority.
20290,"At least once every human should have to run for his life, to teach him that milk does not come from supermarkets, that safety does not come from policemen, that 'news' is not something that happens to other people. He might learn how his ancestors lived and that he himself is no different--in the crunch his life depends on his agility, alertness, and personal resourcefulness."
20291,"Anyone who clings to the historically untrue-and thoroughly immoral-doctrine that, 'violence never settles anything' I would advise to conjure the ghosts of Napoleon Bonaparte and the Duke of Wellington and let them debate it. The ghost of Hitler could referee, and the jury might well be the Dodo, the Great Auk and the Passenger Pigeon. Violence, naked force, has settled more issues in history than has any other factor, and the contrary opinion is wishful thinking at its worst. Breeds that forget this basic truth have always paid for it with their lives and freedom."
20292,There are no dangerous weapons; there are only dangerous men.
20293,Never underestimate the power of human stupidity.
20294,Progress isn't made by early risers. It's made by lazy men trying to find easier ways to do something.
20295,
20296,An armed society is a polite society. Manners are good when one may have to back up his acts with his life.
20297,"Don't ever become a pessimist... a pessimist is correct oftener than an optimist, but an optimist has more fun, and neither can stop the march of events."
20298,"A fool cannot be protected from his folly. If you attempt to do so, you will not only arouse his animosity but also you will be attempting to deprive him of whatever benefit he is capable of deriving from experience. Never attempt to teach a pig to sing; it wastes your time and annoys the pig."
20299,"The police of a state should never be stronger or better armed than the citizenry. An armed citizenry, willing to fight, is the foundation of civil freedom. That's a personal evaluation, of course."
20300,
20301,In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on.
20302,"Half the world is composed of people who have something to say and can't, and the other half who have nothing to say and keep on saying it."
20303,"Live life like its the last breath you take for that breath is the whole essence of living, the little things in life are what connects us to all the big things we live for"
20304,
20305,Tolerance is the uncomfortable feeling that in the end the other could be right.
20306,Education is the ability to listen to almost anything without losing your temper or your self-confidence.
20307,Don't ever take a fence down until you know why it was put up.
20308,Hope is not found in a way out but a way through.
20309,
20310,"Suddenly, quietly, you realize that - from this moment forth - you will no longer walk through this life alone. Like a new sun this awareness arises within you, freeing you from fear, opening your life. It is the beginning of love, and the end of all that came before."
20311,"A mother takes twenty years to make a man of her boy, and another woman makes a fool of him in twenty minutes."
20312,The afternoon knows what the morning never suspected.
20313,"There is one thing more exasperating than a wife who can cook and won't, and that's a wife who can't cook and will."
20314,There's nothing I'm afraid of like scared people.
20315,"Forgive me my nonsense, as I also forgive the nonsense of those that think they talk sense."
20316,A bank is a place where they lend you an umbrella in fair weather and ask for it back when it begins to rain.
20317,"The world is full of willing people; some willing to work, the rest willing to let them."
20318,Poetry is when an emotion has found its thought and the thought has found words.
20319,How many things have to happen to you before something occurs to you?
20320,There are tones of voices that mean more than words.
20321,Take care to sell your horse before he dies. The art of life is passing losses on.
20322,"Keep all ur troubles in ur own pocket. But, make sure that the pocket has a hole!"
20323,Freedom lies in being bold.
20324,A person will sometimes devote all his life to the development of one part of his body - the wishbone.

20329,You know how many seeds are in an apple. But you don't know how many apples are in a seed.
20330,Impossible situations can become possible miracles.
20331,"In difficult times, people too often lose the ability to face the future optimistically. They begin to think about their tomorrow's negatively. They forget that the tough times will pass. They concentrate on the problems of today rather than on the opportunities of tomorrow. In so doing, they not only lose the potential of today, they also throw away the beauty of tomorrow."
20332,"Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future."
20333,"If you listen to your fears, you will die never knowing what a great person you might have been."
20334,"When faced with a mountain, I WILL NOT QUIT! I will keep on striving until I climb over, find a pass through, tunnel underneath, or simply stay and turn the mountain into a gold mine with God's help!"
20335,Faith is reacting positively to a negative situation.
20336,The good news is that the bad news can be turned into good news when you change your attitude.
20337,"Again and again, the impossible problem is solved when we see that the problem is only a tough decision waiting to be made."
20338,I'd rather attempt to do something great and fail than to attempt to do nothing and succeed.
20339,"Lord, make my life A window for Your light To shine through And a mirror to reflect Your love To all I meet. Amen."
20340,I see the invisible. I believe the incredible. I attempt the impossible.
20341,"Never sell tomorrow short. There's plenty to get excited about. Be filled with expectation, hope and confidence. Believe something good is going to happen - and it usually will."
20342,The truth of the matter is that you always know the right thing to do. The hard part is doing it.
20343,"If you are creative enough to imagine a problem, you're clever enough to discover a solution."
20344,God's delays are not God's denials.
20345,Every problem has a limited life span.
20346,I will! I am! I can! I will actualize my dream. I will press ahead. I will settle down and see it through. I will solve the problems. I will pay the price. I will never walk away from my dream until I see my dream walk away: Alert! Alive! Achieved!
20347,When you are in your worst moods. Wait. Be patient. The storm will pass. The spring will come
20348,The only place where your dream becomes impossible is in your own thinking.
20349,"Problems are guidelines, not stop signs!"
20350,
20351,"The word accounting comes from the word accountability. If you are going to be rich, you need to be accountable for your money."
20352,"There are only two things you can invest: Time & Money. Of the two, Time is more important."
20353,You won't learn if you think you already know everything.
20354,"Inside each of you is a rich person, a poor person & a middle class person. It is up to you to decide which person you become."
20355,The main reason people struggle financially is because they have spent years in school but learned nothing about money. The result is that people learn to work for money...but never learn to have money work for them.
20356,"Before you invest in something, invest the time to understand it"
20357,The philosophy of the rich and the poor is this: the rich invest their money and spend what is left. The poor spend their money and invest what is left.
20358,Great opportunities are not seen with your eyes. They are seen with your mind.
20359,To be rich you have to know what it is to be poor. Getting financially literate is part of the price you have to pay to become rich

20361,"Action first, mistakes second, lessons third."
20362,"Remember, your mind is your greatest asset, so be careful what you put into it."
20363,Never say you cannot afford something. That is a poor man's attitude. Ask HOW to afford it.
20364,Losers quit when they fail. Winners fail until they succeed.
20365,"The richest people in the world build networks. Everyone else is trained to look for work, that's why there are two types of people today. Those who build their own dreams and those who build someone else dreams."
20366,The biggest risk a person can take is to do nothing.
20367,
20368,"The main cause of poverty or financial struggle is fear and ignorance, not the economy or the government or the rich."
20369,"Learn how to learn, then learn what to learn"

20373,People don't like the idea of thinking long term. Many are desperately seeking short term answers because they have money problems to be solved today.
20374,"If you want to be rich, be friends with people who have the same mindset as you, or who at least won't try to change your mindset to be more like theirs. Life is too short to spend time with people who don't help you move forward."
20375,
20376,
20377,
20378,
20379,There's no shame in failing. The only shame is not giving things your best shot.
20380,"I wonder what chairs think about all day: ""Oh, here comes another asshole."""
20381,Don't associate yourself with toxic people. It's better to be alone and love yourself than surrounded by people that make you hate yourself.
20382,"The human spirit is more powerful than any drug - and that is what needs to be nourished: with work, play, friendship, family. These are the things that matter."

20391,Sometimes you got to specifically go out of your way to get into trouble. It's called fun.
20392,The human body was designed by a civil engineer. Who else would run a toxic waste pipeline through a recreational area ?
20393,"There's a world out there. Open a window, and it's there."
20394,Good people end up in Hell because they can't forgive themselves.
20395,"Please, don't worry so much. Because in the end, none of us have very long on this Earth. Life is fleeting."

20404,"I fear no one, but respect everyone."
20405,"Tennis can be a very frustrating sport. There is no way around the hard work. Embrace it. You have to put in the hours because there is always something you can improve. [Y]ou have to put in a lot of sacrifice and effort for sometimes little reward but you have to know that, if you put in the right effort, the reward will come."
20406,"Once you find that peace, that place of peace and quiet, harmony and confidence, that's when you start playing your best."

20415,"It is always in my mind still that I can crush anybody. That's not an issue. But I think that is the same for most athletes. If you don't believe you can win tournaments anymore, then you can't do it."
20416,Sometimes you have to accept that a guy played better on the day than you.
20417,I definitely need to use my chances when they come because definitely there wont be many.
20418,"My game is a lot about footwork.  If I move well, I play well."

20421,"Previously I always thought it was just tactical and technique, but every match has become almost mental and physical - I try to push myself to move well. I try to push myself not to get upset and stay positive, and that's what my biggest improvement is over all those years. Under pressure I can see things very clear."
20422,"I enjoyed the position I was in as a tennis player. I was to blame when I lost. I was to blame when I won. And I really like that, because I played soccer a lot too, and I couldn't stand it when I had to blame it on the goalkeeper."
20423,You can be stubborn and successful or you can give it up a bit and change things around. For me it's important to have a bit of both.

20425,
20426,
20427,"No single person, including the President of the United States, should ever be given the power to make a medical decision for potentially millions of Americans. Freedom over one's physical person is the most basic freedom of all, and people in a free society should be sovereign over their own bodies. When we give government the power to make medical decisions for us, we in essence accept that the state owns our bodies."
20428,One thing is clear: The Founding Fathers never intended a nation where citizens would pay nearly half of everything they earn to the government.
20429,"In a free society, we are supposed to know the truth. In a society where truth becomes treason, we are in big trouble."
20430,It is a dangerous notion that we need a government to protect us from ourselves.
20431,"Freedom is not defined by safety. Freedom is defined by the ability of citizens to live without government interference. Government cannot create a world without risks, nor would we really wish to live in such a fictional place. Only a totalitarian society would even claim absolute safety as a worthy ideal, because it would require total state control over its citizens’ lives. Liberty has meaning only if we still believe in it when terrible things happen and a false government security blanket beckons."
20432,
20433,
20434,"If we stuck to the Constitution as written, we would have:  no federal meddling in our schools;  no Federal Reserve;  no U.S. membership in the UN;  no gun control;  and no foreign aid.  We would have no welfare for big corporations, or the ""poor"";   no American troops in 100 foreign countries;  no NAFTA, GAT, or ""fast-track"";  no arrogant federal judges usurping states rights;  no attacks on private property;  no income tax.  We could get rid of most of the agencies, and most of the budget.  The government would be small, frugal, and limited."
20435,"The problem is that democracy is not freedom. Democracy is simply majoritarianism, which is inherently incompatible with real freedom. Our founding fathers clearly understood this."
20436,The Founders warned that a free society depends on a virtuous and moral people. The current crisis reflects that their concerns were justified.
20437,"The most sinister of all taxes is the inflation tax and it is the most regressive. It hits the poor and the middle class. When you destroy a currency by creating money out of thin air to pay the bills, the value of the dollar goes down, and people get hit with a higher cost of living. It's the middle class that's being wiped out. It is most evil of all taxes."
20438,The Federal Reserve System is nothing more than legalized counterfeit.
20439,"Why is patriotism thought to be blind loyalty to the government and the politicians who run it, rather than loyalty to the principles of liberty and support for the people? Real patriotism is a willingness to challenge the government when it's wrong."
20440,"The moral and constitutional obligations of our representatives in Washington are to protect our liberty, not coddle the world, precipitating no-win wars, while bringing bankruptcy and economic turmoil to our people."
20441,Don't steal - the government hates competition!
20442,We don't have the freedom of speech to talk about the weather. We have the first amendment so we can say some very controversial things.
20443,"Governments have nothing. They can't create anything, they never have. All they can do is steal from one group and give it to another at the destruction of the principles of freedom, and we ought to challenge that concept."
20444,The original American patriots were those individuals brave enough to resist with force the oppressive power of King George... Patriotism is more closely linked to dissent than it is to conformity and a blind desire for safety and security.
20445,"If you sacrifice liberty for security, you will lose both."
20446,It is no coincidence that the century of total war coincided with the century of central banking.
20447,The federal government cannot maintain a budget surplus any more than an alcoholic can leave a fresh bottle of whiskey untouched in the cupboard.
20448,"Libertarians are incapable of being a racist, because racism is a collectivist idea."
20449,"Speak up, speak often and don’t worry about those that at this point cannot understand as they can never un-hear what we tell them."
20450,
20451,
20452,
20453,"Government is not a solution to our problem, government is the problem. ... Government does not solve problems; it subsidizes them. Government's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. If it stops moving, subsidize it. ... The problem is not that people are taxed too little, the problem is that government spends too much."
20454,"Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same."
20455,
20456,
20457,"The nine most terrifying words in the English language are ""I'm from the government, and I'm here to help."""
20458,"We must never remain silent in the face of bigotry. We must condemn those who seek to divide us. In all quarters and at all times, we must teach tolerance and denounce racism, anti-Semitism and all ethnic or religious bigotry wherever they exist as unacceptable evils. We have no place for haters in America -- none, whatsoever."
20459,"It's not that liberals aren't smart, it's just that so much of what they know isn't so"
20460,"When a business or an individual spends more than it makes, it goes bankrupt. When government does it, it sends you the bill. And when government does it for 40 years, the bill comes in two ways: higher taxes and inflation. Make no mistake about it, inflation is a tax and not by accident."
20461,A nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation.
20462,"We must reject the idea that every time a law's broken, society is guilty rather than the lawbreaker. It is time to restore the American precept that each individual is accountable for his actions."
20463,The greatest leader is not necessarily the one who does the greatest things. He is the one that gets the people to do the greatest things.
20464,"Now back in 1927 an American socialist, Norman Thomas, six times candidate for president on the Socialist Party ticket, said the American people would never vote for socialism. But he said under the name of liberalism the American people will adopt every fragment of the socialist program."
20465,"If we lose freedom here, there is no place to escape to. This is the last stand on earth."
20466,I've noticed that everyone who is for abortion has already been born.
20467,"Freedom is a fragile thing and is never more than one generation away from extinction. It is not ours by inheritance; it must be fought for and defended constantly by each generation, for it comes only once to a people. Those who have known freedom, and then lost it, have never known it again."
20468,One of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a people has been by way of medicine.
20469,The most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
20470,Evil is powerless if the good are unafraid.
20471,"If more government is the answer, then it was a really stupid question."
20472,"We could say the government spend like drunken sailors, but that would be unfair to drunken sailors, because the sailors are spending their own money."
20473,Almost all the worlds' constitutions are documents in which governments tell the people what their privileges are. Our Constitution is a document in which We the People tell the government what it is allowed to do. We the People are free.
20474,"Because you won't get gun control by disarming law abiding citizens. There's only one way to get real gun control: Disarm the thugs and the criminals, lock them up, and if you don't actually throw away the key, at least lose it for a long time."
20475,
20476,"The Inspiration You Seek 
 Is Already Within You. 
 Be Silent And Listen."
20477,"Whenever you are alone, remind yourself that God has sent everyone else away so that there is only you and Him."
20478,A Candle never Loses any of its Light while Lighting up another candle.
20479,Goodbyes are only for those who love with their eyes. Because for those who love with heart and soul there is no such thing as separation.
20480,"As you start to walk on the way, the way appears."
20481,

Try to be patient and compassionate with yourself.  When you recognize the futility of an old pattern so clearly, it's about to change!  A short time later, you will suddenly begin to respond differently, in a more positive way."
20709,"Whatever our individual troubles and challenges may be, it’s important to pause every now and then to appreciate all that we have, on every level.

20711,"The body is our primary feedback mechanism which can show us what is and isn't working about our ways of thinking, expressing, and living. As we live our truth more fully and freely, our body grows healthier, stronger, and more beautiful."
20712,"Beingness, doingness and havingness are like a triangle where each side supports the others. They are not in conflict with each other. They all exist simultaneously. Often people attempt to live their lives backwards: They try to have more things, or more money, in order to do more of what they want, so that they will be happier. The way it actually works is the reverse. You must first be who you really are, then do what you need to do, in order to have what you want."
20713,"Our life is a reflection of what we believe we deserve. As we deepen our acceptance of and open ourselves to the Infinite love of the universe, a new power flows through us, releasing us from the bondage of our old way of life."

20722,"Our ""life education"" has not necessarily taught us a satisfying way to live. We suffer from a vague sense that there must be something more, some deeper meaning. We must return to kindergarten and start to learn a way of life that is contrary to the way we approached things before-a way of life based on trust of our own inner truth. We can rediscover the child-like innocence and wisdom that knows that anything is possible."
20723,"My primary relationship is with myself- all others are mirrors of it. As I learn to love myself, I automatically receive the love and appreciation that I desire from others. If I am commited to myself and to living my truth, I will attract others with equal commitment. My willingness to be intimate with my own deep feelings creates the space for intimacy with another."
20724,
20725,
20726,We choose not randomly each other. We meet only those who already exists in our subconscious.

20731,Knowledge is the intellectual manipulation of carefully verified observations.
20732,We are what we are because we have been what we have been.
20733,"Human beings are funny. They long to be with the person they love but refuse to admit openly. Some are afraid to show even the slightest sign of affection because of fear. Fear that their feelings may not be recognized, or even worst, returned. But one thing about human beings puzzles me the most is their conscious effort to be connected with the object of their affection even if it kills them slowly within."
20734,All family life is organized around the most damaged person in it.
20735,"The sexual life of adult women is a ""dark continent"" for psychology."

20748,Words have a magical power. They can bring either the greatest happiness or deepest despair; they can transfer knowledge from teacher to student; words enable the orator to sway his audience and dictate its decisions. Words are capable of arousing the strongest emotions and prompting all men's actions.
20749,
20750,"There are four principles we need to maintain: First, read the Word of God. Second, consume the Word of God until it consumes you. Third believe the Word of God. Fourth, act on the Word."
20751,"The reason the world is not seeing Jesus is that Christian people are not filled with Jesus. They are satisfied with attending meetings weekly, reading the Bible occasionally, and praying sometimes. It is an awful thing for me to see people who profess to be Christians lifeless, powerless, and in a place where their lives are so parallel to unbelievers’ lives that it is difficult to tell which place they are in, whether in the flesh or in the Spirit."
20752,
20753,Great faith is the product of great fights. Great testimonies are the outcome of great tests. Great triumphs can only come out of great trials.

20755,"Some people read their Bibles in Hebrew, some in Greek; I like to read mine in the Holy Ghost."
20756,There is something about believing God that will cause Him to pass over a million people to get to you
20757,"You must every day make higher ground. You must deny yourself to make progress with God. You must refuse every- thing that is not pure and holy. God wants you pure in heart. He wants you to have an intense desire after holiness... Two things will get you to leap out of yourselves into the promises of God today. One is purity, and the other is FAITH, which is kindled more and more BY PURITY."
20758,God wants us so badly that he has made the condition as simple as he possibly could: Only believe.

20763,To hunger and thirst after righteousness is when nothing in the world can fascinate us so much as being near God.
20764,"When faith lays hold, impossibilities must yield."
20765,"God never intended His people to be ordinary or commonplace. His intentions were that they should be on fire for Him, conscious of His divine power, realizing the glory of the cross that foreshadows the crown."
20766,"We must be careful not to choose, but to let God's Holy Spirit manage our lives; not to smooth down and explain away, but to stir up the gift and allow God's Spirit to disturb us and disturb us and disturb us until we yield and yield and yield and the possibility in God's mind for us becomes an established fact in our lives, with the rivers in evidence meeting the need of a dying world."
20767,I can't understand God by feelings. I can't understand the Lord Jesus Christ by feelings. I can only understand God the Father and Jesus Christ by what the Word says about them. God is everything the Word says He is. We need to get acquainted with Him through the Word.
20768,"Believe that when you come into the presence of God you can have all you came for. You can take it away, and you can use it, for all the power of God is at your disposal in response to your faith."

20778,"When the debate is lost, slander becomes the tool of the loser."
20779,"Most people, including ourselves, live in a world of relative ignorance. We are even comfortable with that ignorance, because it is all we know. When we first start facing truth, the process may be frightening, and many people run back to their old lives. But if you continue to seek truth, you will eventually be able to handle it better. In fact, you want more! It's true that many people around you now may think you are weird or even a danger to society, but you don't care. Once you've tasted the truth, you won't ever want to go back to being ignorant"
20780,In every person there is a sun. Just let them shine.

20811,
20812,"Researchers from Britain's Keele University have found that swearing after an injury may help alleviate pain. Evidently, the pain that you feel is inversely proportional to the number of middle names you give Jesus."

20814,

20820,Thirty seconds is the exact amount of time Americans can tolerate something they don't understand.
20821,"Remember, you cannot be both young and wise. Young people who pretend to be wise to the ways of the world are mostly just cynics. Cynicism masquerades as wisdom, but it is the farthest thing from it. Because cynics don’t learn anything. Because cynicism is a self-imposed blindness, a rejection of the world because we are afraid it will hurt us or disappoint us. Cynics always say no. But saying “yes” begins things. Saying “yes” is how things grow. Saying “yes” leads to knowledge. “Yes” is for young people. So for as long as you have the strength to, say “yes'."

20829,"The key is not to prioritize what's on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities."
20830,To begin with the end in mind means to start with a clear understanding of your destination. It means to know where you're going so that you better understand where you are now and so that the steps you take are always in the right direction.

20834,"Happiness, like unhappiness, is a proactive choice."
20835,The most effective way I know to begin with the end in mind is to develop a personal mission statement or philosophy or creed. It focused on what you want to be (character) and to do (contributions and achievements) and on the values or principles upon which being and doing are based.
20836,You can learn great things from your mistakes when you aren’t busy denying them.
20837,The key to success is dedication to life-long learning.

20839,
20840,Peace of mind comes when your life is in harmony with true principles and values and in no other way.
20841,"Look at the word responsibility-""response-ability""-the ability to choose your response. Highly proactive people recognize that responsibility. They do not blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior. Their behavior is a product of their own conscious choice, based on values, rather than a product of their conditions, based on feeling."

20846,"When parents see their children's problems as opportunities to build the relationship instead of as negative, burdensome irritations, it totally changes the nature of parent-child interaction. Parents become more willing, even excited, about deeply understanding and helping their children. . . . This paradigm is powerful in business as well."

20863,Half the battle is just showing up.

20907,It takes a lot of hard work to make something simple.
20908,"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition."
20909,Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity - not a threat

20936,"Sooner or later we all discover that the important moments in life are not the advertised ones, not the birthdays, the graduations, the weddings, not the great goals achieved. The real milestones are less prepossessing. They come to the door of memory unannounced, stray dogs that amble in, sniff around a bit and simply never leave. Our lives are measured by these."

20939,There never will be complete equality until women themselves help to make laws and elect lawmakers.
20940,"Women should have equal pay for equal work and they should be considered equally eligible to the offices of principal and superintendent, professor and president. So you must insist that qualifications, not sex, shall govern appointments and salaries."

It is patriotic to support him insofar as he efficiently serves the country. It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent that by inefficiency or otherwise he fails in his duty to stand by the country. In either event, it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth, whether about the president or anyone else."

21186,Courtesy is the due of man to man; not of suit-of-clothes to suit-of-clothes.
21187,Naps are a way of traveling painlessly through time into the future.
21188,A man protesting against error is on the way towards uniting himself with all men that believe in truth.

21191,Without kindness there can be no true joy.
21192,
21193,

21196,A man without a goal is like a ship without a rudder.

21200,All things are difficult before they are easy.
21201,He that cannot forgive others breaks the bridge over which he must pass himself; for every man has need to be forgiven.
21202,An invincible determination can accomplish almost anything and in this lies the great distinction between great men and little men.

21224,
21225,"The issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history, whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite."
21226,"When the people are afraid of the government, that's tyranny. But when the government is afraid of the people, that's liberty."
21227,"When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty."
21228,"I think myself that we have more machinery of government than is necessary, too many parasites living on the labor of the industrious. Government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have ... The course of history shows that as a government grows, liberty decreases. The two enemies of the people are criminals and government, so let us tie the second down with the chains of the constitution so the second will not become the legalized version of the first."
21229,"When you abandon freedom to achieve security, you lose both and deserve neither."
21230,A true patriot will defend his country from its government.
21231,"When once a Republic is corrupted, there is no possibility of remedying any of the growing evils but by removing the corruption and restoring its lost principles; every other correction is either useless or a new evil."
21232,"Laws that forbid the carrying of arms . . . disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes . . . Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man."
21233,
21234,Evil triumphs when good men do nothing.
21235,"To learn, you have to listen. To improve, you have to try."
21236,
21237,"Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends [life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness] it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government."
21238,A private central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army. We must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt.
21239,Democracy is 51% of the people taking away the rights of the other 49%.
21240,A well informed citizenry is the best defense against tyranny.
21241,The cornerstone of democracy rests on the foundation of an educated electorate.

21247,
21248,Peace is that brief glorious moment in history when everybody stands around reloading.
21249,
21250,
21251,"My Lord God, I have no idea where I am going. I do not see the road ahead of me. I cannot know for certain where it will end. Nor do I really know myself, and the fact that I think that I am following Your Will does not mean that I am actually doing so. But I believe that the desire to please You does in fact please You. And I hope I have that desire in all that I am doing."
21252,"The beginning of love is to let those we love be perfectly themselves, and not to twist them to fit our own image. Otherwise we love only the reflection of ourselves we find in them."
21253,"In a world of noise, confusion and conflict it is necessary that there be places of silence, inner discipline and peace. In such places love can blossom."
21254,"You do not need to know precisely what is happening, or exactly where it is all going. What you need is to recognize the possibilities and challenges offered by the present moment, and to embrace them with courage, faith and hope."
21255,"To be grateful is to recognize the Love of God in everything He has given us - and He has given us everything. Every breath we draw is a gift of His love, every moment of existence is a grace, for it brings with it immense graces from Him. Gratitude therefore takes nothing for granted, is never unresponsive, is constantly awakening to new wonder and to praise of the goodness of God. For the grateful person knows that God is good, not by hearsay but by experience. And that is what makes all the difference."
21256,Nothing has ever been said about God that hasn't already been said better by the wind in the pine trees.
21257,"The rush and pressure of modern life are a form, perhaps the most common form, of contemporary violence. To allow oneself to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting concerns, to surrender to too many demands, to commit oneself to too many projects, to want to help everyone in everything, is to succumb to violence. The frenzy of our activity neutralizes our work for peace. It destroys our own inner capacity for peace. It destroys the fruitfulness of our own work, because it kills the root of inner wisdom which makes work fruitful."
21258,In Silence God ceases to be an object and becomes an experience.
21259,"People may spend their whole lives climbing the ladder of success only to find, once they reach the top, that the ladder is leaning against the wrong wall."
21260,"In order to settle down in the quiet of our own being we must learn to be detached from the results of our own activity. We must be content to live without watching ourselves live, to work with expecting immediate reward, to love without an instant satisfaction, and to exist without any special recognition. It is only when we are detached from ourselves that we can be at peace with ourselves."
21261,"When you see God in everyone, then they see God in you."
21262,"Instead of hating the people you think are war-makers, hate the appetites and disorder in your own soul, which are the causes of war. If you love peace, then hate injustice, hate tyranny, hate greed - but hate these things in yourself, not in another."
21263,"The deepest level of communication is not communication, but communion. It is wordless. It is beyond words, and it is beyond speech, and it is beyond concept. Not that we discover a new unity. We discover an older unity. My dear Brothers [and Sisters], we are already one. But we imagine that we are not. And what we have to recover is our original unity. What we have to be is what we are."
21264,Let us come alive to the splendor that is all around us and see the beauty in ordinary things.
21265,"Love in fact is the spiritual life, and without it all the other exercises of the spirit, however lofty, are emptied of content and become mere illusions."
21266,"In the devil's theology, the important thing is to be absolutely right and to prove that everybody else is absolutely wrong."
21267,Do not be too quick to assume your enemy is a savage just because he is your enemy. Perhaps he is your enemy because he thinks you are a savage. Or perhaps he is afraid of you because he feels that you are afraid of him.  And perhaps if he believed you are capable of loving him he would no longer be your enemy.
21268,"Do not look for rest in any pleasure, because you were not created for pleasure: you were created for joy. And if you do not know the difference between pleasure and joy you have not yet begun to live."
21269,"True encounter with Christ liberates something in us, a power we did not know we had, a hope, a capacity for life, a resilience, an ability to bounce back when we thought we were completely defeated, a capacity to grow and change, a power of creative transformation."
21270,Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone - we find it with another.
21271,"Everything in modern city life is calculated to keep man from entering into himself and thinking about spiritual things. Even with the best of intentions a spiritual man finds himself exhausted and deadened and debased by the constant noise of machines and loudspeakers, the dead air and the glaring lights of offices and shops, the everlasting suggestion of advertising and propaganda. The whole mechanism of modern life is geared for a flight from God and from the spirit into the wilderness of neurosis."
21272,"Prayer is not so much a way to find God as a way of resting in him...who loves us, who is near to us."
21273,"To say that I am made in the image of God is to say that love is the reason for my existence, for God is love. Love is my true identity. Selflessness is my true self. Love is my true character. Love is my name."
21274,
21275,
21276,
21277,The greatest tyrannies are always perpetuated in the name of the noblest causes.
21278,
21279,"No country can be called free which is governed by an absolute power; and it matters not whether it be an absolute royal power or an absolute legislative power, as the consequences will be the same to the people."
21280,You cannot undermine police authority and then complain about rising crime.
21281,"A constitution defines and limits the powers of the government it creates. It therefore follows, as a natural and also a logical result, that the governmental exercise of any power not authorized by the constitution is an assumed power, and therefore illegal."
21282,"When all other rights are taken away, the right of rebellion is made perfect."
21283,"These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands it NOW, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman."
21284,Reason obeys itself; and ignorance submits to whatever is dictated to it.
21285,"Our greatest enemies, the ones we must fight most often, are within."
21286,"I prefer peace. But if trouble must come, let it come in my time, so that my children can live in peace."
21287,The slavery of fear had made men afraid to think.
21288,"Taxes were not raised to carry on wars, but that wars were raised to carry on taxes."
21289,"Men who look upon themselves born to reign, and others to obey, soon grow insolent; selected from the rest of mankind their minds are early poisoned by importance; and the world they act in differs so materially from the world at large, that they have but little opportunity of knowing its true interests, and when they succeed to the government are frequently the most ignorant and unfit of any throughout the dominions."
21290,"The real man smiles in trouble, gathers strength from distress, and grows brave by reflection."
21291,"A constitution is not the act of a government, but of a people constituting a government; and government without a constitution is power without a right. All power exercised over a nation, must have some beginning. It must be either delegated, or assumed. There are not other sources. All delegated power is trust, and all assumed power is usurpation. Time does not alter the nature and quality of either."
21292,A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong gives it a superficial appearance of being right.
21293,Government is best which governs least
21294,"[A]ll churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Muslim, are simply human inventions. They use fear to enslave us. They are a monopoly for power and profit."
21295,"He that would make his own liberty secure, must guard even his enemy from oppression; for if he violates this duty, he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself."
21296,"It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies."
21297,"Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property... Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them."
21298,"If I do not believe as you believe, it proves that you do not believe as I believe, and that is all that it proves."
21299,
21300,Everyone can be discontented if he ignores his blessings and looks only at his burdens.
21301,We must develop the capacity to see men not as they are at present but as they may become.
21302,"Stick to a task 'til it sticks to you. . .for beginners are many, but finishers few."
21303,"Stand for right, even if you stand alone."
21304,Happiness comes when we stop complaining about the troubles we have and offer thanks for all the troubles we don't have.
21305,"You can share your testimony in many ways, by the words you speak, by the example you set, by the manner in which you live your life."
21306,"Your Heavenly Father loves you-each of you. That love never changes. It is not influenced by your appearance, by your possessions, or by the amount of money you have in your bank account. It is not changed by your talents and abilities. It is simply there. It is there for you when you are sad or happy, discouraged or hopeful. God's love is there for you whether or not you feel you deserve love. It is simply always there."
21307,One day each of us will run out of tomorrows. Let us not put off what is important.
21308,Don’t limit yourself and don’t let others convince you that you are limited in what you can do. Believe in yourself and then live so as to reach your possibilities. You can achieve what you believe you can. Trust and believe and have faith.
21309,"It’s not enough to wish, it’s not enough to dream, it’s not enough to promise. We must do."
21310,"He who gives money gives some, he who gives time gives more, and he who gives of himself gives all."
21311,Don't save something for a special occasion. Every day of your life is a special occasion.
21312,"Help others in their race of life. Remember that when you help another up a mountain, you are a little nearer the top yourself."
21313,A woman needs to be told she is beautiful. She needs to be told she is valued. She needs to be told she is worthwhile.
21314,So much in life depends on our attitude. The way we choose to see things and respond to others makes all the difference.
21315,"God left the world unfinished for man to work his skill upon. He left the electricity in the cloud, the oil in the earth. He left the rivers unbridged and the forests unfelled and the cities unbuilt. God gives to man the challenge of raw materials, not the ease of finished things. He leaves the pictures unpainted and the music unsung and the problems unsolved, that man might know the joys and glories of creation."
21316,"Family prayer is the greatest deterrent to sin, and hence the most beneficent provider of joy and happiness. The old saying is yet true: 'The family that prays together stays together.'"
21317,"As we arise each morning, let us determine to respond with love and kindness to whatever might come our way."
21318,Often we live side by side but do not communicate heart to heart.
21319,Charity is having patience with someone who has let us down. It is resisting the impulse to become offended easily. It is accepting weaknesses and shortcomings. It is accepting people as they truly are. It is looking beyond physical appearances to attributes that will not dim through time. It is resisting the impulse to categorize others.
21320,"We are reminded that anger doesn't solve anything. It builds nothing, but it can destroy everything."
21321,We are never alone when we stand with our Father in Heaven.
21322,"Raising children, be aware that the piles and piles of laundry will disappear all too soon and that you will, to your surprise, miss them profoundly."
21323,"There is really no way we can know the heart, the intentions, or the circumstances of someone who might say or do something we find reason to criticize. Thus the commandment: 'Judge not.'"
21324,
21325,
21326,"The next time some academics tell you how important diversity is, ask how many Republicans there are in their sociology department."
21327,"Racism is not dead, but it is on life support -- kept alive by politicians, race hustlers and people who get a sense of superiority by denouncing others as 'racists'"
21328,What do you call it when someone steals someone else's money secretly? Theft. What do you call it when someone takes someone else's money openly by force? Robbery. What do you call it when a politician takes someone else's money in taxes and gives it to someone who is more likely to vote for him? Social Justice.
21329,"When you want to help people, you tell them the truth. When you want to help yourself, you tell them what they want to hear."
21330,The problem isn't that Johnny can't read. The problem isn't even that Johnny can't think. The problem is that Johnny doesn't know what thinking is; he confuses it with feeling.
21331,Government's power to bully people who have broken no law is dangerous to all of us.
21332,"You cannot take any people, of any color, and exempt them from the requirements of civilization - including work, behavioral standards, personal responsibility, and all the other basic things that the clever intelligentsia disdain - without ruinous consequences to them and to society at large."
21333,"Not since the days of the Hitler Youth have young people been subjected to more propaganda on more politically correct issues.  At one time, educators boasted that their role was not to teach students what to think but how to think.  Today, their role is far too often to teach students what to think on everything from immigration to global warming to the new sacred trinity of 'race, class and gender.'"
21334,"Just as any moron can destroy a priceless Ming vase, so the shallow and ill-educated people who run our schools can undermine and destroy from within a great civilization that took centuries of dedicated effort to create and maintain."
21335,It is bad enough that so many people believe things without any evidence. What is worse is that some people have no conception of evidence and regard facts as just someone else's opinion.
21336,"You may have the right to live anyway you like, but you don't have a right to have other people like it. Respect it or pay for it."
21337,"One of the most important reasons for studying history is that virtually every stupid idea that is in vogue today has been tried before and proved disastrous before, time and again."
21338,"The welfare state has always been judged by its good intentions, rather than its bad results."
21339,"Blacks were not enslaved because they were black but because they were available. Slavery has existed in the world for thousands of years. Whites enslaved other whites in Europe for centuries before the first black was brought to the Western hemisphere. Asians enslaved Europeans. Asians enslaved other Asians. Africans enslaved other Africans, and indeed even today in North Africa, blacks continue to enslave blacks."
21340,"In a democracy, we have always had to worry about the ignorance of the uneducated.  Today we have to worry about the ignorance of people with college degrees."
21341,"The welfare state is the oldest con game in the world. First you take people's money away quietly, and then you give some of it back to them flamboyantly."
21342,"One of the sad signs of our times is that we have demonized those who produce, subsidized those who refuse to produce, and canonized those who complain."
21343,"If you believe in equal rights, then what do “women’s rights,” “gay rights,” etc., mean? Either they are redundant or they are violations of the principle of equal rights for all."
21344,What exactly is your 'fair share' of what 'someone else' has worked for?
21345,"Activism is a way for useless people to feel important, even if the consequences of their activism are counterproductive for those they claim to be helping and damaging to the fabric of society as a whole."
21346,"The reason so many people misunderstand so many issues is not that these issues are so complex, but that people do not want a factual or analytical explanation that leaves them emotionally unsatisfied. They want villains to hate and heroes to cheer - and they don't want explanations that do not give them that."
21347,"A friend from India told me that a countryman of his said: ""I want to go to America. I want to see a country where poor people are fat."""
21348,"One of the painful signs of years of dumbed-down education is how many people are unable to make a coherent argument. They can vent their emotions, question other people's motives, make bold assertions, repeat slogans-- anything except reason."
21349,
21350,"If you don't have time, the truth is, you don't have priorities. Think harder; don't work harder."
21351,It isn't enough to think outside the box. Thinking is passive. Get used to acting outside the box.
21352,"Tomorrow becomes never. No matter how small the task, take the first step now!"
21353,"One can steal ideas, but no one can steal execution or passion."
21354,There are two components that are fundamental to enjoy life and feel good about yourself: continual learning and service.
21355,Being busy is a form of laziness - lazy thinking and indiscriminate action. Being busy is most often used as a guise for avoiding the few critically important but uncomfortable actions.
21356,"You can lose money and make it back, you can't do that with time."
21357,"The best way to improve mental performance, is to improve physical performance"
21358,Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself. You are better than you think.
21359,"To do the impossible, you need to ignore the popular."
21360,Money doesn't change you; it reveals who you are when you no longer have to be nice.
21361,Lack of time is actually lack of priorities.
21362,"But you are the average of the five people you associate with most, so do not underestimate the effects of your pessimistic, unambitious, or disorganized friends. If someone isn't making you stronger, they're making you weaker."
21363,The most important actions are never comfortable.
21364,"An entrepreneur isn't someone who owns a business, it's someone who makes things happen."
21365,"Luxury, to me, is not owning a lot of stuff. Luxury, to me, is feeling unrushed."
21366,"The question you should be asking isn't, ""What do I want?"" or ""What are my goals?"" but ""What would excite me?"
21367,What you do is infinitely more important than how you do it.
21368,"There are tons of things in your home and life that you don't use, need, or even particularly want. They just came into your life as impulsive flotsam and jetsam and never found a good exit. Whether you're aware of it or not, this clutter creates indecision and distractions."
21369,"Believe it or not, it is not only possible to accomplish more by doing less, it is mandatory. Enter the world of elimination."
21370,"For all of the most important things, the timing always sucks. Waiting for a good time to quit your job? The stars will never align and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the same time. The universe doesn't conspire against you, but it doesn't go out of its way to line up the pins either. Conditions are never perfect. ""Someday"" is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it's important to you and you want to do it ""eventually,"" just do it and correct course along the way."
21371,Slow down and remember this: Most things make no difference. Being busy is a form of mental laziness-lazy thinking and indiscriminate action.
21372,Slow down and remember this: Most things make no difference.
21373,Being selective-doing less-is the path of the productive. Focus on the important few and ignore the rest.
21374,
21375,"The only love that won’t disappoint you is one that can’t change, that can’t be lost, that is not based on the ups and downs of life or of how well you live. It is something that not even death can take away from you. God’s love is the only thing like that."
21376,"The gospel is this: We are more sinful and flawed in ourselves than we ever dared believe, yet at the very same time we are more loved and accepted in Jesus Christ than we ever dared hope."
21377,"Jesus Christ did not suffer so that you would not suffer. He suffered so that when you suffer, you’ll become more like him. The gospel does not promise you better life circumstances; it promises you a better life."
21378,"Like a baby learning language, we learn how to communicate with God by listening to His words first."
21379,"Religion says earn your life. Secular society says create your life. Jesus says, 'My life for your life."
21380,Putting our faith in Christ is not about trying harder; it means transferring our trust away from ourselves and resting in him.
21381,How do you change your behavior? Change what you worship
21382,"Legalistic remorse says, ""I broke God's rules,"" while real repentance says, ""I broke God's heart."""
21383,The Gospel is good news not good advice. Advice = what we should do. News = report of what was done for us.
21384,"Worry is not believing God will get it right, and bitterness is believing God got it wrong."
21385,Suffering can refine us rather than destroy us because God himself walks with us in the fire.
21386,The only person who dares wake up a king at 3:00 AM for a glass of water is a child. We have that kind of access
21387,"If God is not at the center of your life, something else is."
21388,"Jesus didn't come to tell us the answers to the questions of life, he came to be the answer."
21389,"The Bible’s purpose is not so much to show you how to live a good life. The Bible’s purpose is to show you how God’s grace breaks into your life against your will and saves you from the sin and brokenness otherwise you would never be able to overcome… religion is ‘if you obey, then you will be accepted’. But the Gospel is, ‘if you are absolutely accepted, and sure you’re accepted, only then will you ever begin to obey’. Those are two utterly different things. Every page of the Bible shows the difference."
21390,"God looks at the anxious and says, I tore my Son to shreds for you, and you're afraid I will not give you what you need?"
21391,"The basic purpose of prayer is not to bend God's will to mine, but to mold my will into His."
21392,"The Christian Gospel is that I am so flawed that Jesus had to die for me, yet I am so loved and valued that Jesus was glad to die for me. This leads to deep humility and deep confidence at the same time. It undermines both swaggering and sniveling. I cannot feel superior to anyone, and yet I have nothing to prove to anyone. I do not think more of myself nor less of myself. Instead, I think of myself less."
21393,Every single emotion you have should be processed in prayer.
21394,"Success and suffering will either darken your heart or make you wise, but they won't leave you where you were."
21395,How does Satan accuse us? By causing us to look at our sin rather than our Savior.
21396,Faith is not primarily a function of how you feel. Faith is living out and believing what truth is despite what you feel.
21397,"In the original language, 'Fear the Lord' doesn't mean be afraid. It means sustaining a joyful, astonished awe, and wonder before Him."
21398,Trust is accepting what God sends into your life whether you understand it or not.

21409,"You go through big chunks of time where you're just thinking, 'this is impossible - oh,this is impossible'. And then you just keep going and keep going, and you sort of do the impossible."
21410,"Now every girl is expected to have: Caucasian blue eyes, full Spanish lips, a classic button nose, hairless Asian skin with a California tan, a Jamaican dance hall ass, long Swedish legs, small Japanese feet, the abs of a lesbian gym owner, the hips of a nine-year-old boy, the arms of Michelle Obama, and doll tits. The person closest to actually achieving this look is Kim Kardashian, who, as we know, was made by Russian scientists to sabotage our athletes."
21411,Whatever the problem - be part of the solution
21412,Just say yes and you'll figure it out afterwards.

21417,"It was reported that Guy Ritchie has cast his wife Madonna in a small walk-on role in his new movie, Revolver. Madonna will play the part of the woman who ruins the film."

21419,And I can see Russia from my house.
21420,"If you retain nothing else, always remember the most important Rule of Beauty. “Who cares?”"
21421,"In a study, scientists report that drinking beer can be good for the liver. I'm sorry, did I say 'scientists'? I meant Irish people."
21422,I want to thank my parents for somehow raising me to have confidence that is disproportionate with my looks and abilities.
21423,"In order to feel safer on his private jet, actor John Travolta has purchased a bomb-sniffing dog. Unfortunately for the actor, the dog came six movies too late."
21424,
21425,"There is no time for despair, no place for self-pity, no need for silence, no room for fear. We speak, we write, we do language. That is how civilizations heal."
21426,"I tell my students, 'When you get these jobs that you have been so brilliantly trained for, just remember that your real job is that if you are free, you need to free somebody else. If you have some power, then your job is to empower somebody else. This is not just a grab-bag candy game."
21427,"I know the world is bruised and bleeding, and though it is important not to ignore its pain, it is also critical to refuse to succumb to its malevolence. Like failure, chaos contains information that can lead to knowledge - even wisdom. Like art."
21428,The function of freedom is to free someone else.
21429,"There is no such thing as race. None. There is just a human race - scientifically, anthropologically. Racism is a construct, a social construct... it has a social function, racism."

21433,Make a difference about something other than yourselves.
21434,All important things are hard.
21435,
21436,"It's important, therefore, to know who the real enemy is, and to know the function, the very serious function of racism, which is distraction. It keeps you from doing your work. It keeps you explaining over and over again, your reason for being. Somebody says you have no language and so you spend 20 years proving that you do. Somebody says your head isn't shaped properly so you have scientists working on the fact that it is. Someone says you have no art so you dredge that up. Somebody says you have no kingdoms and so you dredge that up. None of that is necessary. There will always be one more thing."
21437,A friend gathers all the pieces and gives them back in the right order.
21438,"Racism will disappear when it's no longer profitable, and no longer psychologically useful. And when that happens, it'll be gone. But at the moment, people make a lot of money off of it, pro and con."

21441,What's the world for you if you can't make it up the way you want it?
21442,The peace I am thinking of is the dance of an open mind when it engages another equally open one.
21443,"I am a writer and my faith in the world of art is intense, but not irrational, nor naïve - because art takes us and makes us take a journey beyond price, beyond cost, into bearing witness to the world as it is and as it should be. Art invites us to know beauty and to solicit it, summon it, from even the most tragic of circumstances."
21444,Let your face speak what's in your heart.
21445,"Please don't settle for happiness. It's not good enough. Of course you deserve it, but if that's all you have in mind - happiness - I want to suggest to you that personal success devoid of meaningfulness, free of a steady commitment to social justice - that's more than a barren life. It's a trivial one."

21461,"It's not about your resources, it's about your resourcefulness ."
21462,"Where focus goes, energy flows. And where energy flows, whatever you're focusing on grows. In other words, your life is controlled by what you focus on. That's why you need to focus on where you want to go, not on what you fear. When you next find yourself in a state of uncertainty, resist your fear. Shift your focus toward where you want to go and your actions will take you in that direction."
21463,"If you want anything to change, you've got to change it. If you want things to get better, you've got to get better. And the only way to really do well in life is to find more value than anybody."
21464,"Most people aren't really happy, but they aren't unhappy enough to do anything about it. That's a dangerous place to be."
21465,The road to someday leads to a town of nowhere.
21466,Don't limit your challenges; challenge your limits. Each day we must strive for constant and never ending improvement.

21471,Love is not a business. It's not a transaction. It's not an exchange or something you get for doing something it's not a trade. It's a gift!
21472,
21473,Expect change. Analyze the landscape. Take the opportunities. Stop being the chess piece; become the player. It's your move.
21474,
21475,"Sometimes you just have to turn the page to realize there's more to your book of life than the page you're stuck on. Stop being afraid to move on. Close this chapter of hurt, and never re-read it. It's time to get what your life deserves, and move on from the things that don't deserve you. Don't try to fix what's been broken in your past, let your future create something better."
21476,"Everybody isn't your friend. Just because they hang around you and laugh with you doesn't mean they're for you. Just because they say they got got your back, doesn't mean they won't stab you in it. People pretend well. Jealousy sometimes doesn't live far. So know your circle. At the end of the day real situations expose fake people so pay attention."
21477,Stop trying to change someone who does not want to change. Stop giving chances to someone who abuses your forgiveness. Stop walking back to the place where your heart ran from. Stop trusting their words and ignoring their actions. Stop breaking your own heart.
21478,"A relationship means you come together to make each other better. It’s not all about you, and it’s not all about them. Its all about the relationship.
Support them in their dreams/vision just as much as you would expect them to support you. Make each other better. Challenge each other to go beyond average. Pull out the greatness from within each other.
Make sure they can find their biggest fan in you, and you can find yours in them."
21479,Don't let anyone drain you of your happiness today. Be drama free. Rise above the petty stuff.

21481,"Just because they say they're praying for you in your face, doesn't mean they aren't laughing at your struggle behind your back."
21482,Don’t stay stuck on the people who’ve hurt you. Move on and let your future give you the better that you deserve.
21483,You never have to question something that's real.
21484,Never make excuses for someone who disrespects you-who they are or what they do isn't a pass to treat you like trash!

21511,"I gotta big mouth, I can't help it, I talk from my heart, I'm real, whatever comes comes. But my controversy problem, it's not my fault, I try to find my way in the world you know, I try to be somebody instead of just make money off of everybody. So I go down paths that haven't been traveled before and I usually mess up, but I learn, I come back stronger."
21512,Whatever you see you gotta keep a sense of humor; you gotta be able to smile through all the bullshit.

21514,
21515,"As we watch the sun go down, evening after evening, through the smog across the poisoned waters of our native earth, we must ask ourselves seriously whether we really wish some future universal historian on another planet to say about us: ""With all their genius and with all their skill, they ran out of foresight and air and food and water and ideas,"" or, They went on playing politics until their world collapsed around them."

I was brought up not only to develop the spirit of tolerance but also to cherish moral and spiritual qualities such as modesty, humility, compassion, and, most important, to attain a certain degree of emotional equilibrium."
21521,Respect for the truth comes close to being the basis for all morality.

21526,"As a Buddhist, I was trained to be tolerant of everything except intolerance"
21527,"The law of love and compassion for all living creatures is again a doctrine to which we are all too ready to pay slip service. However, if it is to become a reality, it requires a process of education, a veritable mental renaissance. Once it has become a reality, national as well as international problems will fall into perspectives and become easier to solve. Wars and conflicts, too, will then become a thing of the past, because wars begin in the minds of men, and in those minds love and compassion would have built the defenses of peace."
21528,"The single most important impediment to global institutions is the concept of ""my country, right or wrong""."
21529,To understand my feelings — and my conception of the role of Secretary General — the nature of my religious and cultural background must first be understood. I should therefore like to outline not only my beliefs but also my conception of human institutions and of the human situation itself.
21530,World federalists hold before us the vision of a unified mankind living in peace under a just world order... The heart of their program-a world under law- is realistic and attainable.

21535,"What is there to understand? The significance of life? How long will it take to understand the significance and the meaning of life? 20 years? 30 years? And the same question will be here in another 20 years, I guarantee you. Until you stop asking that question. When that question is not there, you are there. So that's the reason why you keep asking the question: you do not want the question to come to an end. When that comes to an end, there will not be anybody, left there, to find out the meaning, the purpose and the significance of life."
21536,"All I can guarantee you is that as long as you are searching for happiness, you will remain unhappy."

21538,"Charity is the filthiest invention of the human mind: first you steal what belongs to everyone; then you use the law and various other means to protect it. 

 You give charity to prevent the have-nots from rebelling against you. It also makes you feel less guilty. All do-gooders feel 'high' when they do good."
21539,"The body is a fortuitous concourse of atoms. There is no death for the body, only an exchange of atoms. Their changing places and taking different forms is what we call 'death.' It's a process which restores the energy level in nature that has gone down. In reality, nothing is born and nothing is dead."
21540,"I have searched everywhere to find an answer to my question, 'Is there enlightenment?' but have never questioned the search itself. Because I have assumed that goal of enlightenment exists, I have had to search. It is the search itself which has been choking me and keeping me out of my natural state. There is no such thing as spiritual or psychological enlightenment because there is no such thing as spirit or psyche at all. I have been a damn fool all my life, searching for something which does not exist. My search is at an end."
21541,"This question haunted me all my life and suddenly it hit me: 'There is no self to realize. What the hell have I been doing all this time?' You see, that hits you like lightning. Once that hits you, the whole mechanism of the body that is controlled by this thought is shattered. What is left is the tremendous living organism with an intelligence of its own. What you are left with is the pulse, the beat and the throb of life."
21542,*Only if you reject all the other paths can you discover your own path.
21543,"You think when you don't want to do anything. Thinking is a poor alternative to acting. Your thinking is consuming all your energy. Act, don't think!"
21544,"All your experiences, all your meditations, all your prayer, all that you do, is self-centred. It is strengthening the self, adding momentum, gathering momentum, so it is taking you in the opposite direction. Whatever you do to be free from the self also is a self-centred activity."
21545,"Food, clothing and shelter — these are the basic needs. Beyond that, if you want anything, it is the beginning of self-deception."
21546,"Everything you stand for, believe in, experience and aspire to is the result of thought. And thought is destructive because it is nothing more than a protective mechanism, programmed to protect its own interests at all costs."
21547,"You are not ready to accept the fact that you have to give up. A complete and total 'surrender'. 

 It is a state of hopelessness which says that there is no way out. Any movement in any direction, on any dimension, at any level, is taking you away from yourself."
21548,"The plain fact is that if you don't have a problem, you create one. If you don't have a problem you don't feel that you are living."

21550,"Man is just a memory. You understand things around you by the help of the knowledge that was put in you. You perhaps need the artist to explain his modern art, but you don't need anybody's help to understand a flower. You can deal with anything, you can do anything if you do not waste your energy trying to achieve imaginary goals."
21551,"To be yourself requires extraordinary intelligence. You are blessed with that intelligence; nobody need give it to you; nobody can take it away from you. He who lets that express itself in its own way is a ""Natural Man""."
21552,The body is not interested in anything you are interested in. And that is the battle that is going on all the time.
21553,"My interest is to point out to you that you can walk, and please throw away all those crutches. If you are really handicapped, I wouldn’t advise you to do any such thing. But you are made to feel by other people that you are handicapped so that they could sell you those crutches. Throw them away and you can walk. That’s all that I can say. ‘If I fall....’ - that is your fear. Put the crutches away, and you are not going to fall."
21554,There is no need to change this world at all; and there is no need to change yourself either.
21555,"There is no such thing as truth. The only thing that is actually there is your 'logically' ascertained premise, which you call truth."
21556,Your constant utilization of thought to give continuity to your separate self is you. There is nothing there inside you other than that.
21557,"It is fear that makes you believe that you are living and that you will be dead.What we do not want is the fear to come to an end. That is why we have invented all these new minds, new sciences,new talks, therapies, choiceless awareness and various other gimmicks."
21558,

21560,"Given the proper suggestion, the Subconscious Mind will manifest success from failure, health from disease, prosperity from poverty, friendship and love from loneliness and isolation. For nothing is impossible to the Subconscious Mind and it operates entirely by suggestion."
21561,"When you paint success pictures in your mind, you initiate an inner process whereby your attitudes, hopes, aspirations, and enthusiasm are elevated in response to an image of a more promising future. Every person who aspires must first sell themselves hope, the promise of a better life."
21562,Pessimists are second rate people. They do not believe in life. ... All they want to do is drag you down and appease their own feelings of mediocrity and fear.

21590,There is no forgiveness in nature.
21591,
21592,"If you throw one stone, it’s a punishable offence. If 1,000 stones are thrown, it’s political action. If you set a car on fire, it’s a punishable offence. If hundreds of cars are set on fire, it’s political action. Protest is when I say I don’t agree with something. Resistance is when I ensure that things with which I disagree no longer take place."
21593,"These are the strategic dialectics of anti-imperialist struggle: through the defensive reactions of the system, the escalation of counterrevolution, the transformation of the political martial law into military martial law, the enemy betrays himself, becomes visible."

21606,"I felt like anything rather than rejoicing at the downfall of a foe who had fought so long and valiantly, and had suffered so much for a cause, though that cause was, I believe, one of the worst for which a people ever fought, and one for which there was the least excuse."
21607,"... anything is better than indecision. We must decide. If I am wrong, we shall soon find out and can do the other thing. But not to decide wastes both time and money and may ruin everything."
21608,"Let us labor for the security of free thought, free speech, pure morals, unfettered religious sentiments, and equal rights and privileges for all men, irrespective of nationality, color, or religion;.... leave the matter of religious teaching to the family altar, the church, and the private school, supported entirely by private contribution. Keep church and state forever separate."
21609,"Hold fast to the Bible as the sheet-anchor of your liberties; write its precepts in your hearts, and practice them in your lives."
21610,"The art of war is simple enough. Find out where your enemy is. Get at him as soon as you can. Strike him as hard as you can, and keep moving on."
21611,The friend in my adversity I shall always cherish most. I can better trust those who helped to relieve the gloom of my dark hours than those who are so ready to enjoy with me the sunshine of my prosperity.
21612,"Nations, like individuals, are punished for their transgressions."
21613,"As soon as slavery fired upon the flag it was felt, we all felt, even those who did not object to slaves, that slavery must be destroyed. We felt that it was a stain to the Union that men should be bought and sold like cattle."
21614,"Wars produce many stories of fiction, some of which are told until they are believed to be true."
21615,"Although a soldier by profession, I have never felt any sort of fondness for war, and I have never advocated it, except as a means of peace."
21616,The will of the people is the best law.

21618,I will not move my army without onions.
21619,Two commanders on the same field are always one too many.
21620,"The right of revolution is an inherent one. When people are oppressed by their government, it is a natural right they enjoy to relieve themselves of oppression, if they are strong enough, whether by withdrawal from it, or by overthrowing it and substituting a government more acceptable."
21621,Our great modern Republic. May those who seek the blessings of its institutions and the protection of its flag remember the obligations they impose.
21622,Quit thinking about what Bobby Lee's gonna do to us and start thinking about what we're going to do to him.
21623,The fact is I think I am a verb instead of a personal pronoun. A verb is anything that signifies to be; to do; or to suffer. I signify all three.
21624,"All secret oath-bound political parties are dangerous to any nation, no matter how pure or how patriotic the motives and principles which first bring them together."
21625,Hold fast to the Bible. To the influence of this Book we are indebted for all the progress made in true civilization and to this we must look as our guide in the future.
21626,
21627,It is technically a failure when you don't try.
21628,Boredom is a great motivator.
21629,"Before I had my child, I thought I knew all the boundaries of myself, that I understood the limits of my heart. It's extraordinary to have all those limits thrown out, to realize your love is inexhaustible."
21630,I do think that what's wonderful in life is that we gain perspective as we take on different roles that are mind and heart opening.
21631,Thats when you know youve found somebody special. When you can just shut the f**k up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.
21632,"Three tomatoes are walking down the street-a poppa tomato, a mamma tomato, and a little baby tomato. Baby tomato starts lagging behind. Poppa tomato gets angry, goes over to the baby tomato, and smooshes him and says, Catch up."
21633,Daring to me is having courage; it's a daily meditation to take breath and find strength.
21634,Change is usually preceded by some kind of drift.
21635,My washing machine overwhelms me with its options and its sophistication.
21636,Life sweeps you up. Some people resist a lot. I probably haven't resisted very much.
21637,We're in an environment where everyone gets compartmentalized very quickly.
21638,"I think actresses are imagined to be these subjects of great vanity. Life is change; physicality changes. It's transient, and that's a beautiful and a painful thing."
21639,It's taken me a long time to learn to accept the risks and just be willing to try it over and over again.
21640,It is better to have a relationship with someone who cheats on you than with someone who does not flush the toilet.
21641,"I spent the first fourteen years of my life convinced that my looks were hideous. Adolescence is painful for everyone, I know, but mine was plain weird."
21642,I think that life force is invaluable.
21643,"Even, today, when people tell me I'm beautiful, I do not believe a word of it."
21644,"One feels so despairing on some levels about what's going on in our culture, in regards to things like gender inequality. But there is progress. There is enhanced empathy and respect for others, we are fighting the tide, even though it seems like a tug of war sometimes."
21645,I was an escapee of childhood. I always wanted to grow up.
21646,"You know what daring really is to me? It's maybe much more simple: the willingness to get up and try it again. It's not about whether or not you fall down, it's how you get back up. And I've taken quite a few tumbles, myself."
21647,"It's one of the things that weirdly I always used to like about my job: that expressing the emotions of a writer or someone creative and breathing empathy and life into a character people can then identify with, that they'd feel less alone."
21648,"When asked if I consider myself Buddhist, the answer is, Not really. But it's more my religion than any other because I was brought up with it in an intellectual and spiritual environment. I don't practice or preach it, however. But Buddhism has had a major effect on who I am and how I think about the world. What I have learned is that I like all religions, but only parts of them."
21649,"I'm very happy at home. I love to just hang out with my daughter, I love to work in my garden. I'm not a gaping hole of need."
21650,I've learned that every working mom is a superwoman.
21651,
21652,"Sometimes the people with the worst past, create the best future"
21653,"No amount of worrying can change the future. Go easy on yourself, for the outcome of all affairs is determined by God's decree. If something is meant to go elsewhere, it will never come your way, but if it is yours by destiny, from you it cannot flee."
21654,Do not depend upon the morality of a person until you have seen him behave while in anger.
21655,"To speak less is wisdom, to eat less is healthy, and to mingle less with te people is safe and serene."
21656,"I looked at all friends, and did not find a better friend than safeguarding the tongue. I thought about all dresses, but did not find a better dress than piety. I thought about all types of wealth, but did not find a better wealth than contentment in little. I thought of all types of good deeds, but did not find a better deed than offering good advice. I looked at all types of sustenance, but did not find a better sustenance than patience."
21657,"That which you do not wish for yourself, do not impose on others."
21658,He who does not live in the way of his beliefs starts to believe in the way he lives.

21663,"Islam will be destroyed by the mistakes of scholars, the arguments of the hypocrites who misinterpret the Qur’an to support their views and misleading rulers."
21664,No amount of guilt can change the past and no amount of worrying can change the future
21665,"Get used to a rough life, for luxury does not last forever."
21666,To forgive an oppressor is oppression upon the oppressed.
21667,"If a person has ten habits out of which nine are good and one bad, that bad one will destroy the good ones."
21668,"What regresses, never progresses."
21669,To be alone means that you avoid bad company. But to have a true friend is better than being alone.
21670,"I fear the day when the Kuffar are proud of their falsehood, and the Muslims are shy of their faith."
21671,"I am surprised at three things: 1. [A] man runs from death while death is inevitable. 2. One sees minor faults in others, yet overlooks his own major faults. 3. When there is any defect to one's cattle he tries to cure it, but does not cure his own defects."
21672,"As long as you are pure of heart, you speak the truth."
21673,Patience is the healthiest ingredient of our life.
21674,"I will be harsh and stern against the aggressor, but I will be a pillar of strength for the weak.I will not calm down until I will put one cheek of a tyrant on the ground and the other under my feet, and for the poor and weak, I will put my cheek on the ground."
21675,"The less of the World, the freer you live."
21676,
21677,Every great thinker is someone else's moron.
21678,"There are four types: the cretin, the imbecile, the stupid and the mad. Normality is a balanced mixture of all four."
21679,"If you interact with things in your life, everything is constantly changing. And if nothing changes, you're an idiot."
21680,"When men stop believing in God, it isn't that they then believe in nothing: they believe in everything."
21681,"Books are not made to be believed, but to be subjected to inquiry. When we consider a book, we mustn't ask ourselves what it says but what it means."
21682,"The wise man does not discriminate; he gathers all the shreds of light, from wherever they may come."
21683,"Not long ago, if you wanted to seize political power in a country you had merely to control the army and the police. Today it is only in the most backward countries that fascist generals, in carrying out a coup d'état, still use tanks. If a country has reached a high degree of industrialization the whole scene changes.... Today a country belongs to the person who controls communications."
21684,"Given that there are seven billion people living on this earth, there is a consistent quantity of imbecile or idiot, okay. Previously, these people could express themselves only with their friends or at the bar after two or three glasses of something, and they said every silliness, and people laughed. Now they have the possibility to show up on the internet. And so, on the internet, along with the messages of a lot of interesting and important people - even the Pope is writing on Twitter - we have a great quantity of idiots."
21685,"To survive, you must tell stories."
21686,"All the blogs, Facebook, Twitter are made by people who want to show their own private affairs at the price of making fakes, to try to appear such as they are not, to construct another personality, which is a veritable loss of identity."
21687,"I believe that what we become depends on what our fathers teach us at odd moments, when they aren't trying to teach us. We are formed by little scraps of wisdom."
21688,"Poetry is not a matter of feelings, it is a matter of language. It is language which creates feelings."
21689,"The problem with the Internet is that it gives you everything - reliable material and crazy material. So the problem becomes, how do you discriminate?"
21690,"Never affirm, always allude: allusions are made to test the spirit and probe the heart."
21691,"I have come to believe that the whole world is an enigma, a harmless enigma that is made terrible by our own mad attempt to interpret it as though it had an underlying truth."
21692,Love is wiser than wisdom.
21693,"Originality and creativity are nothing but the result of the wise management of combinations. The creative genius combines more rapidly, and with a greater critical sense of what gets tossed out and what gets saved, the same material that the failed genius has to work with."
21694,"We are always remaking history. Our memory is always an interpretive reconstruction of the past, so is perspective."
21695,What is life if not the shadow of a fleeting dream?
21696,We are formed by little scraps of wisdom.
21697,I always assume that a good book is more intelligent than its author. It can say things that the writer is not aware of.
21698,"We have a limit, a very discouraging, humiliating limit: death. That's why we like all the things that we assume have no limits and, therefore, no end. It's a way of escaping thoughts about death. We like lists because we don't want to die."
21699,I love the smell of book ink in the morning.
21700,I have lost the freedom of not having an opinion.
21701,
21702,"It is foolish to be convinced without evidence, but it is equally foolish to refuse to be convinced by real evidence."
21703,"You don't have to be satisfied with America as you find it. You can change it. I didn't like the way I found America some sixty years ago, and I've been trying to change it ever since."
21704,One of the necessary accompaniments of capitalism in a democracy is political corruption.
21705,"I don't know whether anyone will care to examine my heart, but if they do, they will find two words there- 'social justice.' For that is what I have believed in and fought for."
21706,"I aimed at the public's heart, and by accident I hit it in the stomach."
21707,"Journalism is one of the devices whereby industrial autocracy keeps its control over political democracy; it is the day-by-day, between-elections propaganda, whereby the minds of the people are kept in a state of acquiescence, so that when the crisis of an election comes, they go to the polls and cast their ballots for either one of the two candidates of their exploiters."
21708,"The American People will take Socialism, but they won't take the label. I certainly proved it in the case of EPIC [End Poverty in California]. Running on the Socialist ticket I got 60,000 votes, and running on the slogan to 'End Poverty in California' I got 879,000. I think we simply have to recognize the fact that our enemies have succeeded in spreading the Big Lie. There is no use attacking it by a front attack, it is much better to out-flank them."
21709,The private control of credit is the modern form of slavery.
21710,You can't make somebody understand something if their salary depends upon them not understanding it.
21711,Fascism is capitalism plus murder.
21712,"When the masters of industry pay such sums for a newspaper, they buy not merely the building and the presses and the name; they buy what they call the ""good-will""- that is, they buy you. And they proceed to change your whole psychology - everything that you believe about life. You might object to it, if you knew; but they do their work so subtly that you never guess what is happening to you!"
21713,"The supreme crime of the church to-day is that everywhere and in all its operations and influences it is on the side of sloth of mind; that it banishes brains, it sanctifies stupidity, it canonizes incompetence."
21714,"American journalism is a class institution, serving the rich and spurning the poor."
21715,"There is one kind of prison where the man is behind bars, and everything that he desires is outside; and there is another kind where the things are behind the bars, and the man is outside."
21716,"Can you blame me if I am pursued by the thought of how much we could do to remedy social evils, if only we had an honest and disinterested press?"
21717,They use everything about the hog except the squeal.
21718,"Man is an evasive beast, given to cultivating strange notions about himself."
21719,"Into this wild-beast tangle these men had been born without their consent, they had taken part in it because they could not help it; that they were in jail was no disgrace to them, for the game had never been fair, the dice were loaded. They were swindlers and thieves of pennies and dimes, and they had been trapped and put out of the way by the swindlers and thieves of millions of dollars."
21720,"Consider Christmas - could Satan in his most malignant mood have devised a worse combination of graft plus bunkum than the system whereby several hundred million people get a billion or so gifts for which they have no use, and some thousands of shop clerks die of exhaustion while selling them, and every other child in the Western world is made ill from overeating - all in the name of the lowly Jesus?"
21721,"The first thing brought forth by the study of any religion, ancient or modern, is that it is based upon Fear, born of it, fed by it — and that it cultivates the source from which its nourishment is derived."
21722,"I have not only found good health, but perfect health; I have found a new state of being, a potentiality of life; a sense of lightness and cleanness and joyfulness, such as I did not know could exist in the human body."
21723,"Through fasting. . .I have found a perfect health, a new state of existence, a feeling of purity and happiness, something unknown to humans."
21724,"But I have a conscience and a religious faith, and I know that our liberties were not won without suffering, and may be lost again through our cowardice. I intend to do my duty to my
 country."
21725,I am sustained by a sense of the worthwhileness of what I am doing; a trust in the good faith of the process which created and sustains me. That process I call God.
21726,
21727,"Do what you love. When you love your work, you become the best worker in the world."
21728,I was sued by a woman who claimed that she became pregnant because she watched me on television and I bent her contraceptive coil.
21729,I believe that we're all connected to each other with an invisible spiritual thread through which we can transmit energy emissions and positive thinking. I want you to use your visualization techniques.
21730,"If you're brilliant and open-minded, you can start at the top."
21731,I don't fear death because I believe it is a transition. Our souls can't be destroyed. I know we are going to live in another life.
21732,I no longer want to be rich because I am rich.
21733,"Our meaning is to make our little planet Earth a better place to live, to stop wars, disarm nuclear missiles, to stop diseases, AIDS, plague, cancer and to stop pollution."
21734,"I was about five years old when I was eating soup in our kitchen, and as I was lifting the spoon towards my mouth, it bent and broke in half."
21735,I'll no longer say that I have supernatural powers. I am an entertainer. I want to do a good show. My entire character has changed.
21736,"Nowadays even presidents, vice-presidents, and heads of big agencies are opening their minds to accept psychic phenomena, because they know it works."
21737,"Either the phone is so seriously thin and flimsy that it is bendable with mere physical force, which I cannot believe given the extensive tests Apple would have done. Or -- and this is far more plausible -- somehow the energy and excitement of the 10 million people who purchased iPhones has awakened their mind powers and caused the phones to bend."
21738,"The lnternet is turning economics inside-out. For example, everybody on the internet now wants stuff for free and there are so many free services available."
21739,"We're all brilliant at something. I discovered my powers when I was four years old. When you're young you're more in touch with your real talents, but so often the 30 year slog knocks it out of people."
21740,"I think I usually have quite ordinary dreams. Sometimes my dreams take me to other dimensions. I can travel in my mind especially when I'm dreaming I focus my mind on what I want to dream. If I want to fly, I focus on flying."
21741,"Larry Geller’s Leaves of Elvis’ Garden is by far the best book I have ever read about Elvis.  It is emotional, revealing and spiritual, and offers the most amazing insight into the king.  I highly recommend this dynamic book."
21742,"I believe in past lives but I know nothing about mine and I don't want to know. I live in the present, taking one day at a time."
21743,"I sought a great performer who would deeply impress me, and I found Lior Suchard."
21744,I'm a religious man. I am Jewish but I believe in all religions. I believe in God and see him as an old man with a big white beard and pray to him every day for a few minutes.
21745,"I've stopped caring about skeptics, but if they libel or defame me they will end up in court."
21746,Ive just taught thousands of people over the radio in the USA how to mend broken watches and broken house appliances. I am a catalyst or trigger to access these powers.
21747,"So, I am independently well-off and don't have to do anything, but I still do. I write books, lecture around the world, work with scientists and governments."
21748,"I've seen lights in the sky, I've seen UFOs, I've even seen something on the ground that I can't explain, but I've never actually seen a being. I wish I had."
21749,"Scientists want full proof under laboratory conditions. And the answer is very simple: When Im put under pressure, I cant perform. Even the phenomenon Im most known for. When Im on stage, Im not under pressure and it happens. In other important places, it happens. But in a laboratory where I really want it to happen, its very hard for me."
21750,"I don't take myself seriously all the time; I have to do quirky things, such as helping football teams, moving the ball away from McAllister's foot, getting into The Sun and The Star - because, you know, I like sensationalism, it's a part of what I do."
21751,
21752,Every child needs at least one adult who is irrationally crazy about him or her.
21753,"Turning on the television set can turn off the process that transforms children into people... It is primarily through observing, playing, and working with others older and younger than himself that a child discovers both what he can do and who he can become — that he develops both his ability and his identity."
21754,"No society can long sustain itself unless its members have learned the sensitivities, motivations and skills involved in assisting and caring for other human beings."
21755,"If the children and youth of a nation are afforded opportunity to develop their capacities to the fullest, if they are given the knowledge to understand the world and the wisdom to change it, then the prospects for the future are bright. In contrast, a society which neglects its children, however well it may function in other respects, risks eventual disorganization and demise."
21756,"Development, it turns out, occurs through this process of progressively more complex exchange between a child and somebody else- especially somebody who’s crazy about that child"
21757,"There is no more critical indicator of the future of a society than the character, competence, and integrity of its youth."
21758,Particular attention should be given to the opportunities which the environment presents or precludes for involvement of children with persons both older and younger than themselves.
21759,"We as a nation need to be reeducated about the necessary and sufficient conditions for making human beings human. We need to be reeducated not as parents--but as workers, neighbors, and friends; and as members of the organizations, committees, boards--and, especially, the informal networks that control our social institutions and thereby determine the conditions of life for our families and their children."
21760,"The primary danger of the television screen lies not so much in the behavior it produces as the behavior it prevents-the talks, the games, the family activities and the arguments through which much of the child's learning takes place and his character is formed."
21761,"Witness the American ideal: the Self-Made Man. But there is no such person. If we can stand on our own two feet, it is because others have raised us up. If, as adults, we can lay claim to competence and compassion, it only means that other human beings have been willing and enabled to commit their competence and compassion to us--through infancy, childhood, and adolescence, right up to this very moment."
21762,"In today's world parents find themselves at the mercy of a society which imposes pressures and priorities that allow neither timenor place for meaningful activities and relations between children and adults, which downgrade the role of parents and the functions of parenthood, and which prevent the parent from doing things he wants to do as a guide, friend, and companion to his children."
21763,"In the United States, it is now possible for a person eighteen years of age, female as well as male, to graduate from high school, college, or university without ever having cared for, or even held, a baby; without ever having looked after someone who was old, ill, or lonely; or without ever having comforted or assisted another human being who really needed help... No society can long sustain itself unless its members have learned the sensitivities, motivations, and skills involved in assisting and caring for other human beings."
21764,"In the planning and designing of new communities, housing projects, and urban renewal, the planners both private and public, need to give explicit consideration to the kind of world that is being created for the children who will be growing up in these settings. Particular attention should be given to the opportunities which the environment presents or precludes for involvement of children both older and younger than themselves."
21765,"Thus if we know a child has had sufficient opportunity to observe and acquire a behavioural sequence, and we know he is physically capable of performng the act but does not do so, tehn it is reasonable to assume that it is motivation which is lacking"
21766,"Like the sorcerer of old, the television set casts its magic spell, freezing speech and action and turning the living into silent statues so long as the enchantment lasts. The primary danger of the television screen lies not so much in the behavior it produces as the behavior it prevents — the talks, the games, the family festivities and arguments."
21767,"One of the most significant effects of age-segregation in our society has been the isolation of children from the world of work. Whereas in the past children not only saw what their parents did for a living but even shared substantially in the task, many children nowadays have only a vague notion of the nature of the parent's job, and have had little or no opportunity to observe the parent, or for that matter any other adult, when he is fully engaged in his work."
21768,"Thus if we know a child has had sufficient opportunity to observe and acquire a behavioral sequence, and we know he is physically capable of performing the act but does not do so, then it is reasonable to assume that it is motivation which is lacking. The appropriate countermeasure then involves increasing the subjective value of the desired act relative to any competing response tendencies he might have, rather than having the model senselessly repeat an already redundant sequence of behavior."
21769,"If the Russians have gone too far in subjecting the child and his peer group to conformity to a single set of values imposed by the adult society, perhaps we have reached the point of diminishing returns in allowing excessive autonomy and in failing to utilize the constructive potential of the peer group in developing social responsibility and consideration for others."
21770,
21771,I don't have time to think about age. There are so many things to do.
21772,"Even if you have $20,000 to buy an item, you still try to get a good price at antique stores. I collect furniture, rugs, paintings, frames. It's my hobby to go around to shops and markets."
21773,I take care of my flowers and my cats. And enjoy food. And that's living.
21774,I love everything that's beautiful. A lot of things.
21775,"Everything is a piece of me, a moment of my life."
21776,"I don't use my body to seduce, no. I just stand there."
21777,"I suddenly find out that I'm 60, and I get shocked by the number, because I feel like I'm 20."
21778,"If I don't have room for an item, I put it in warehouses."
21779,"They offered me one cover about 10 years ago, and I said, no, I can't do it. I'm happy to cover up now."
21780,I wanted to be a decorator. I wanted to interior design homes and do everything myself.
21781,"If the role demands it, then naturally I will remove my clothes."
21782,"It's going to be over soon, so I don't really have time to get busy."
21783,I hate the word sexy.
21784,Collecting is my joy; it gives me great satisfaction.
21785,"When I go to a country, I go to flea markets, antique stores. I am always looking for something."
21786,"I hate to look at myself in a mirror, and I never go and see films."
21787,I couldn't live up to it. So I chose to run away.
21788,"I fell from the sky. I'm a parachutist, and I missed my mark."
21789,I mostly gave away what I had from the James Bond movie.
21790,Don't take anything from me because I'll track it down.
21791,Collecting is my passion.
21792,I never went to school. I never went to acting school because I was so scared.
21793,I'm always shocked when I see myself because I don't recognize myself.
21794,"Elvis and I continued to be friends, and I saw him once or twice a year. But he was a troubled person."
21795,
21796,Go to bed; tired is stupid.
21797,"We live in capitalism, its power seems inescapable - but then, so did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art. Very often in our art, the art of words."
21798,"Change is freedom, change is life. It's always easier not to think for oneself. Find a nice safe hierarchy and settle in. Don't make changes, don't risk disapproval, don't upset your syndics. It's always easiest to let yourself be governed. There's a point, around age twenty, when you have to choose whether to be like everybody else the rest of your life, or to make a virtue of your peculiarities. Those who build walls are their own prisoners. I'm going to go fulfil my proper function in the social organism. I'm going to go unbuild walls."
21799,People who deny the existence of dragons are often eaten by dragons. From within.
21800,"No darkness lasts forever. And even there, there are stars."

21804,To have a choice at all is to be privileged.
21805,"We read books to find out who we are. What other people, real or imaginary, do and think and feel... is an essential guide to our understanding of what we ourselves are and may become."
21806,"Capitalism’s grow-or-die imperative stands radically at odds with ecology’s imperative of interdependence and limit. The two imperatives can no longer coexist with each other; nor can any society founded on the myth that they can be reconciled hope to survive. Either we will establish an ecological society or society will go under for everyone, irrespective of his or her status."
21807,"Injustice makes the rules, and courage breaks them."
21808,To see that your life is a story while you're in the middle of living it may be a help to living it well.
21809,"A writer is a person who cares what words mean, what they say, how they say it. Writers know words are their way towards truth and freedom, and so they use them with care, with thought, with fear, with delight. By using words well they strengthen their souls. Story-tellers and poets spend their lives learning that skill and art of using words well. And their words make the souls of their readers stronger, brighter, deeper."

21817,A dangerous book will always be in danger from those it threatens with the demand that they question their assumptions. They'd rather hang on to the assumptions and ban the book.

21820,
21821,Emotion combined with an artist's discipline is the rarest thing in the world.
21822,"The creative artist is the one wanting to make order out of chaos. The rest of us just accept disorder -if we even recognize it- and get a bang out of our five beautiful senses, if we’re lucky."

21830,"I think sometimes, when you're on top and all you do is win, win, win, win, win, you get lazy and lose focus. When you lose it opens your eyes and you get serious. There is always a time when it is good to lose, at the right time for you."

21835,"For me, I'm focused on what I want to do. I know what I need to do to be a champion, so I'm working on it."
21836,"I have just accepted certain things and it makes it easier. I accept I will get injured. I accept I cannot win every race. I work hard to decrease the chances of those things happening but I accept they will happen. A lot of people don't accept it. They get injured, they go crazy."
21837,I don't think limits.
21838,You have to get to the worst to get better.
21839,I stopped worrying about the start. The end is what's important.
21840,I just want to push the barriers and see what I can do and how far I can go. I am just determined and driven.
21841,I know what I can do so it doesn't bother me what other people think or their opinion on the situation.
21842,"Each training session I'm getting better and better. I have no other duties now, no worries, it's all about training, eating and sleeping. I have a lot more time and can put a lot more effort into training. I'm feeling better every day. As long as I'm feeling myself I'm definitely in no doubt I can go to the Olympics and win."

21856,You either evolve or dissolve.
21857,"For a woman to be able to dominate and also be feminine and soft, that's a talent. And its not all about appearance. A woman who has a brain, who is street-smart and book-smart, that woman is very, very sexy to me."

21871,"The first time I got a chance to meet Michael was onstage at Madison Square Garden. There were tons of people on the stage, and I just remember losing my mind. Like, Oh my God, that's Michael Jackson right there. I was just over his right shoulder. And then when I finally got a chance to get on the stage with him, I was just shut down. He had the type of magic that you just bowed to. I just said, ""I love you, and I know you've heard it a million and one times from fans all over the world, but you've meant so much to me as an entertainer, and I love you, and I've admired you all these years."
21872,Down time is not the name of the game.

21877,We must overcome the notion that we must be regular... it robs you of the chance to be extraordinary and leads you to the mediocre.
21878,"Theoretically, the actor ought to be more sound in mind and body than other people, since he learns to understand the psychological problems of human beings when putting his own passions, his loves, fears, and rages to work in the service of the characters he plays. He will learn to face himself, to hide nothing from himself- and to do so takes AN INSATIABLE CURIOSITY ABOUT THE HUMAN CONDITION"
21879,"The actor must know that since he, himself, is the instrument, he must play on it to serve the character with the same effortless dexterity with which the violinist makes music on his. Just because he doesn't look like a violin is no reason to assume his techniques should be thought of as less difficult."
21880,"Talent is an amalgam of high sensitivity; easy vulnerability; high sensory equipment (seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, tasting intensely); a vivid imagination as well as a grip on reality; the desire to communicate one's own experience and sensations, to make one's self heard and seen."
21881,"Since the time of the ancient Greeks a democracy has depended on its philosophers and creative artists. It can only flourish by continuous probing, prodding, and questioning of the social conditions under which man exists and tries to better himself. One of the first moves of a dictatorship is to stifle the artists and thinkers who have the ability to stir up dissent from any prescribed dogma which might enslave them. Because the artist can arouse the curiosity and conscience of his community, he becomes a threat to those who have taken power."
21882,To rebel or revolt against the status quo is in the very nature of an artist.
21883,"Thoughts and feelings are suspended in a vacuum unless they instigate and feed the selected actions, and it is the characters actions which reveal the character in the play."
21884,One cannot demand of art that it pay you in any other way than in the satisfaction of the work itself.
21885,"For some strange reason, we believe that anyone who lived before we were born was in some peculiar way a different kind of human being from any we have come in contact with in our own lifetime. This concept must be changed; we must realize in our bones that almost everything in time and history has changed except the human being."
21886,"If you want a bourgeois existence, you shouldn't be an actor. You're in the wrong profession."
21887,"Once in a while, there's stuff that makes me say, That's what theatre's about. It has to be a human event on the stage, and that doesn't happen very often."
21888,Keep pace with the present. Take a trip to the moon. envision the future.
21889,The need to be loved and protected is at a peak when we feel abandoned and are particularly vulnerable to difficult circumstances.
21890,"We were not allowed to say, Screw, but we could say, Hump the hostess, because hump is in Shakespeare."
21891,I love going to the movies; I love watching good movie actors. They must know something I don't.
21892,"It must be noted that it is often the colleague or direct disciple of a new thinker who gets stuck in literal interpretations of the work, tending to freeze the new ideas and language into an inflexible, static condition."
21893,I love playing Chekhov. That's the hardest; that's why I love it most.
21894,We had a relationship that lasted 44 years. Herbert and I lived together 10 years before we were married. He always gave me a little heart for whatever anniversary.
21895,I have disassociated myself from that book.

21898,I won't go to England because they won't let my dog in.
21899,"You are about to be told one more time that you are America's most valuable natural resource. Have you seen what they do to valuable natural resources?! Have you seen a strip mine? Have you seen a clear cut in the forest? Have you seen a polluted river? Don't ever let them call you a valuable natural resource! They're going to strip mine your soul. They're going to clear cut your best thoughts for the sake of profit unless you learn to resist, because the profit system follows the path of least resistance and following the path of least resistance is what makes the river crooked!"
21900,The Earth is not dying-it is being killed. And the people who are killing it have names and addresses.
21901,"Kids don't have a little brother working in the coal mine, they don't have a little sister coughing her lungs out in the looms of the big mill towns of the Northeast. Why? Because we organized; we broke the back of the sweatshops in this country; we have child labor laws. Those were not benevolent gifts from enlightened management. They were fought for, they were bled for, they were died for by working people, by people like us. Kids ought to know that."
21902,"The state can't give you freedom, and the state can't take it away. You're born with it, like your eyes, like your ears. Freedom is something you assume, then you wait for someone to try to take it away. The degree to which you resist is the degree to which you are free."
21903,The degree to which you resist is the degree to which you are free.
21904,"Time is an enormous, long river, and I’m standing in it, just as you’re standing in it. My elders are the tributaries, and everything they thought and every struggle they went through and everything they gave their lives to, and every song they created, and every poem that they laid down flows down to me – and if I take the time to ask, and if I take the time to see, and if I take the time to reach out, I can build that bridge between my world and theirs. I can reach down into that river and take out what I need to get through this world"
21905,"I said, ""OK, Ammon [Hennacy], I will try that."" He said, ""You came into the world armed to the teeth. With an arsenal of weapons, weapons of privilege, economic privilege, sexual privilege, racial privilege. You want to be a pacifist, you're not just going to have to give up guns, knives, clubs, hard, angry words, you are going to have lay down the weapons of privilege and go into the world completely disarmed."""
21906,The most un-American thing you can do is to stifle dissent
21907,Every good educator knows that true teaching is to teach kids how to ask the right questions.
21908,"Children, be worried when they call you America's most valuable natural resource. Have you seen what they've done to the other natural resources?"
21909,"I'm here to change the world, and if I am not, I am probably wasting my time."
21910,"When I went to high school - that's about as far as I got - reading my U.S. history textbook, well, I got the history of the ruling class.  I got the history of the generals and the industrialists and the presidents that didn't get caught.  How 'bout you?  I got all of the history of the people who owned the wealth of the country, but none of the history of the people that created it."
21911,"But if it’s true that the only true life I had was the life of my brain, what sense does it make to hand that brain to somebody for eight hours a day for their particular use on the presumption that, at the end of the day, they will give it back in an unmutilated condition? Fat chance!"
21912,"As I have said so often before, the long memory is the most radical idea in America..."
21913,Sing your song Dance your dance Tell your story I will Listen and remember
21914,"I guarantee, that if I am elected, I will take over the White House, hang out, shoot pool, scratch my ass, and not do a damn thing . . . Which is to say, if you want something done, don't come to me to do it for you; you got to get together and figure out how to do it yourselves. Is that a deal?"
21915,"My pacifism came after I joined the army and was shipped over to Korea. There was a little one-room orphanage there called Song-do. There were 180 babies in there, and they were GI babies. The U.S. government would not acknowledge this, and the Korean government had nothing to do with them. They were living on a 100-pound bag of rice a month. Some of those kids, when they were old enough, would go out and shine shoes. They would show up at the gate of our compound to shine shoes, and you'd swear they were looking for their fathers."
21916,"They're going to clear cut your best thoughts for the sake of profit unless you learn to resist, because the profit system follows the path of least resistance and following the path of least resistance is what makes the river crooked!"
21917,"Folk music isn't owned by anybody. It is owned by everybody, like the national parks, the postal system, and the school system. It's our common property. There is nobody's name on it. Nobody can make money on it. It's not copywritten."
21918,Chris Chandler is the best performance poet I have ever seen.
21919,"Laurie Lewis' songs combine passion and sheer craft in a way you don't hear very often. Whatever country music is supposed to be, she's at the center of it."

21929,If anyone stumbles then he must repent. If anyone errs then he must repent. And no one must insist on (the path of) destruction. If anyone insists on tyranny then he is far away from the path

21933,
21934,"In nature's economy the currency is not money, it is life."
21935,"We share this planet, our home, with millions of species. Justice and sustainability both demand that we do not use more resources than we need."
21936,"I do not allow myself to be overcome by hopelessness, no matter how tough the situation. I believe that if you just do your little bit without thinking of the bigness of what you stand against, if you turn to the enlargement of your own capacities, just that itself creates new potential."
21937,"Diversity creates harmony, and harmony creates beauty, balance, bounty and peace in nature and society, in agriculture and culture, in science and in politics."

21943,"An organic farmer is the best peacemaker today, because there is more violence, more death, more destruction, more wars, through a violent industrial agricultural system. And to shift away from that into an agriculture of peace is what organic farming is doing."
21944,It is not an investment if it destroys the planet
21945,"I think the American people should see that the corporations abandoned them long ago. That people will have to build their own economies and rebuild democracy as a living democracy. The corporations belong to no land, no country, no people. They have no loyalty to anything apart from the base-line - their profits. And the profits today are on an unimaginable scale; it has become illegitimate, criminal profit - profits extracted at the cost of life."
21946,"We've moved from wisdom to knowledge, and now we're moving from knowledge to information, and that information is so partial – that we're creating incomplete human beings."

21951,"A single, one-dimensional way of thinking has created a monoculture of the mind. And the monoculture of the mind has become a self-fulfilling prophecy. This is the root of why we have pitted equity against ecology and sustainability against justice."
21952,"The primary threat to nature and people today comes from centralising and monopolising power and control. Not until diversity is made the logic of production will there be a chance for sustainability, justice and peace. Cultivating and conserving diversity is no luxury in our times: it is a survival imperative."
21953,"In traditional agriculture, the soil is the mother. She's the mother who gives, to whom you must give back."
21954,"I believe that we will see a lot of destruction, but I believe that if we can see the right patterns and draw the right lessons from that destruction, we might be able to rebuild before it's too late. And then I have that ultimate optimism that even if we can't, life will rebuild itself. In a way, the global economy might collapse, but Gaia won't, and people's ingenuity won't. We will rebuild society, we will rebuild local economies, we will rebuild human aspirations."
21955,"Earth Democracy connects people in circles of care, cooperation, and compassion instead of dividing them through competition and conflict, fear and hatred."

21957,"When the forest is destroyed, when the river is dammed, when the biodiversity is stolen, when fields are waterlogged or turned saline because of economic activities, it is a question of survival for these people. So our environmental movements have been justice movements."
21958,

21961,"I want people to see the dress, but focus on the woman."
21962,"When you have a passion for something then you tend not only to be better at it, but you work harder at it too."
21963,Don't be afraid to take time to learn. It's good to work for other people. I worked for others for 20 years. They paid me to learn.
21964,"When you love something, every day goes by in 10 minutes."
21965,I never thought I'd be successful. It seems in my own mind that in everything I've undertaken I've never quite made the mark. But I've always been able to put disappointments aside. Success isn't about the end result; it's about what you learn along the way.
21966,"The key is falling in love with something, anything. If your heart's attached to it, then your mind will be attached to it."
21967,It's a remarkable exercise to sit and look at your own work over the years.
21968,"Every woman hates her own body. I don't know a woman who doesn't . . . well, I do know a few who love themselves but in the case of most women it's like, ""ugh."" And when I dress a woman, my design intention is to give them an attitude or a grace, no matter whether it's a wedding gown or ready-to-wear."
21969,My normal routine is pretty much putting out fires all day.

21971,Fashion offers no greater challenge than finding what works for night without looking like you are wearing a costume.
21972,"Fashion to me has become very disposable; I wanted to get back to craft, to clothes that could last."
21973,A bride should look at everything she possibly can...just so she can experiment and see what makes her really feel beautiful or glamorous or classical or whatever she desires to be on that particular day.
21974,I've always tried to push myself technically and to push myself visually. That's been part of the journey.
21975,"I see myself as a true modernist. Even when I do a traditional gown, I give it a modern twist. I go to the past for research. I need to know what came before so I can break the rules."
21976,I love a black wedding dress.
21977,I see myself as an arbiter of taste.
21978,It's hard to balance everything. It's always challenging.
21979,"When I design a wedding dress with a bustle, it has to be one the bride can dance in. I love the idea that something is practical and still looks great."
21980,"Although in skating you compete with other people, anyone who achieves a certain level of success is first and foremost competing against themselves. And for me the idea that I could always do better, learn more, learn faster, is something that came from skating. But I carried that with me for the rest of my life."
21981,I am not the sort of woman who would wear high heels with a bathing suit. Let's get that straight right now.
21982,Even the most understated ceremony involves a certain respect for ritual and pageantry. No one plays more of a significant role than the bride's attendants.
21983,
21984,Experience is the worst teacher; it gives the test before presenting the lesson.
21985,Some people are so busy in learning the tricks of the trade that they never learn the trade.

21989,
21990,
21991,"You cannot stop destructive actions by others, but you can stop your own destructive reactions to them"
21992,"We never get upset over what happens. Never. We get upset because of preconceived ideas as to what we think should happen, what we want to happen. When our preference clashes with the reality, we get hurt. Rid yourself of all preconceived ideas as to what should happen. You are then at peace whatever happens."
21993,"Do not be impatient with your seemingly slow progress. Do not try to run faster than you presently can. If you are studying, reflecting and trying, you are making progress whether you are aware of it or not. A traveler walking the road in the darkness of night is still going forward. Someday, some way, everything will break open, like the natural unfolding of a rosebud."
21994,Our freedom can be measured by the number of things we can walk away from.

 mountainside than to chatter for years about the mountaintop."
21996,"No one on earth can hurt you, unless you accept the hurt in your own mind. . . The problem is not other people; it is your reaction."
21997,How would you feel if you had no fear? Feel like that. How would you behave toward other people if you realized their powerlessness to hurt you? Behave like that. How would your react to so-called misfortune if you saw its inability to bother you? React like that. How would you think toward yourself if you knew you were really all right? Think like that.
21998,See human nonsense as nonsense and save years of trying to make sense out of it.
21999,Be teachable. That is the whole secret.

22007,"Suppose you stand on a high place to enjoy the beauty of the sparkling sea below. You need do nothing to create that beauty; you need only BE IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE IT IS, and let nature do the rest. So it is with the inner life. There is nothing we can DO to gain psychic beauty. It already exists without our effort. We need only be where we belong, that is, in self-union. Then, beauty IS."
22008,"A chief cause of unhappiness is what I call mental movies. Mental movies are a misuse of the imagination. You know how it goes. You have a painful experience with someone, then run it over and over in your mind. You visualize what you said, what he did, how you both felt. As awful as it is, you feel compelled to repeat the film day and night. It is as if you were locked inside a theatre playing a horrible movie."
22009,"Truth does not really hurt, rather it is our resistance to its message that causes us pain."
22010,Truth is not a matter of personal viewpoint.
22011,"The outer storm ceases the moment the inner storm ends, for they are the same storm."
22012,"Awareness of your weakness and confusion makes you strong because conscious awareness is the bright light that destroys the darkness of negativity. Detection of inner negativity is not a negative act, but a courageously positive act that makes you a new person."
22013,"Don't try to be spiritual. That is only a word in the dictionary. Make it your goal to become a normally functioning individual. Let these principles shape you according to your real nature of a simple, decent, honest, unafraid human being."
22014,
22015,"I've reached a point in my life where it's the little things that matter... I was always a rebel and probably could have got much farther had I changed my attitude. But when you think about it, I got pretty far without changing attitudes. I'm happier with that."
22016,I will have one of the cleanest obits of any actress. I never did cheesecake like Ann Sheridan or Betty Grable. I just used my hair.
22017,"There's no doubt I was a bit of a misfit in the Hollywood of the forties. The race for glamour left me far behind. I didn't really want to keep up. I wanted my stardom without the usual trimmings. Because of this, I was branded a rebel at the very least. But I don't regret that for a minute. My appetite was my own and I simply wouldn't have it any other way."
22018,You could put all the talent I had into your left eye and still not suffer from impaired vision.
22019,"Hollywood gives a young girl the aura of one giant, self-contained orgy farm, its inhabitants dedicated to crawling into every pair of pants they can find."
22020,I never did cheesecake; I just used my hair.
22021,"I think I've developed into an actress because I've worked darn hard at it and I've learned a great deal from a lot of gifted people. And if I have nothing else to show for my life, apart from a scrapbook full of cuttings, I have the knowledge that my early days in Hollywood weren't in vain."
22022,Alan Ladd was a marvelous person in his simplicity. In so many ways we were kindred spirits. We both were professionally conceived through Hollywood's search for box office and the types to insure the box office. And we were both little people. Alan wasn't as short as most people believe. It was true that in certain films Alan would climb a small platform or the girl worked in a slit trench. We had no such problems together.

22031,I will be my undoing If I become my obsession.
22032,We both have war inside us. Sometimes it keeps us alive. Sometimes it threatens to destroy us.
22033,"It's strange how a word, a phrase, a sentence, can feel like a blow to the head."
22034,"Do remember, though, that sometimes the people you oppress become mightier than you would like."
22035,One choice can transform you. One choice can destroy you. Once choice will define you.
22036,"It's strange how time can make a place shrink, make its strangeness ordinary."
22037,The truth has a way of changing people's plans.
22038,"Every faction conditions its members to think and act a certain way. And most people do it. For most people, it's not hard to learn, to find a pattern of thought that works and stay that way. But our minds move in a dozen different directions. We can't be confined to one way of thinking, and that terrifies our leaders. It means we can't be controlled. And it means that no matter what they do, we will always cause trouble for them."
22039,"Sorry, am I being rude?"" she asks. ""I'm used to saying whatever is on my mind. Mom used to say that politeness is deception in pretty packaging"
22040,"There are so many ways to be brave in this world. Sometimes it involves giving up everything you have ever known, or everyone you have ever loved for the sake of something greater."
22041,Sometimes drastic change requires drastic measures.
22042,"There is always somthing to learn, always somthing that is important to understand"
22043,"We believe in shouting for those who can only whisper, in defending those who cannot defend themselves."
22044,"If I let a little of the emotion out, all of it will come out, and it will never end."

22077,"If you celebrate your differentness, the world will, too. It believes exactly what you tell it-through the words you use to describe yourself, the actions you take to care for yourself, and the choices you make to express yourself. Tell the world you are one-of-a-kind creation who came here to experience wonder and spread joy. Expect to be accommodated."
22078,"A simple life is not seeing how little we can get by with-that's poverty-but how efficiently we can put first things first. . . . When you're clear about your purpose and your priorities, you can painlessly discard whatever does not support these, whether it's clutter in your cabinets or commitments on your calendar. (148)"
22079,"To the people who love you, you are beautiful already. This is not because they're blind to your shortcomings but because they so clearly see your soul. Your shortcomings then dim by comparison. The people who care about you are willing to let you be imperfect and beautiful, too."

22086,"In terms of days and moments lived, you'll never again be as young as you are right now, so spend this day, the youth of your future, in a way that deflects regret. Invest in yourself. Have some fun. Do something important. Love somebody extra. In one sense, you're just a kid, but a kid with enough years on her to know that every day is priceless."

22091,"Self-esteem is the result of recognizing our personal power; awe and wonder come from recognizing our lack of it.  Both are true, and in an exceptional life there is no conflict between them."

22095,"Compassion in action may be the glorious possibility that could protect our crowded, polluted planet."
22096,"The strongest animals on earth are plant eaters. Every creature we've enlisted to do the work we couldn't handle - the horse, donkey, elephant, camel, water buffalo, ox, yak - is an herbivore... whose huge muscles were built from plant protein, and whose strong bones got that way, and stayed that way, from grazing on grass and eating other vegetables."
22097,"That old saying about opportunity only knocking once is as archaic as the flat-earth theory and as patently untrue.  Opportunity knocks all the time - and it rings your doorbell, calls you up, and sends you e-mails."
22098,"We do children an enormous disservice when we assume that they cannot appreciate anything beyond drive through fare and nutritionally marginal, kid-targeted convenience foods. Our children are capable of consuming something that grew in a garden or on a tree and never saw a deep fryer. They are capable of making it through diner at a sit-down restaurant with tablecloths and no climbing equipment. Children deserve quality nourishment."
22099,
22100,"Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation."
22101,When we are no longer able to change a situation - we are challenged to change ourselves.
22102,"Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her own life."
22103,"We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."

22108,"Success, like happiness, is the unexpected side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself."
22109,The one thing you can't take away from me is the way I choose to respond to what you do to me.
22110,"Our greatest human freedom is that, despite whatever our physical situation is in life, WE ARE ALWAYS FREE TO CHOOSE OUR THOUGHTS!"
22111,The meaning of my life is to help others find meaning in theirs.
22112,"Ever more people today have the means to live, but no meaning to live for."
22113,"We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed. For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one's predicament into a human achievement. When we are no longer able to change a situation-just think of an incurable disease such as inoperable cancer-we are challenged to change ourselves."
22114,What is to give light must endure burning.
22115,Our greatest freedom is the freedom to choose our attitude.
22116,"Don't aim at success — the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long run — in the long run, I say — success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it."
22117,Every human being has the freedom to change at any instant.
22118,"In times of crisis, people reach for meaning. Meaning is strength. Our survival may depend on our seeking and finding it."
22119,"Each of us carries a unique spark of the divine, and each of us is also an inseparable part of the web of life."
22120,"To be sure, man's search for meaning may arouse inner tension rather than inner equilibrium. However, precisely such tension is an indispensable prerequisite of mental health. There is nothing in the world, I venture to say, that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the knowledge that there is a meaning in one's life. There is much wisdom in the words of Nietzsche: ""He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how"
22121,The quest for meaning is the key to mental health and human flourishing
22122,"It isn't the past which holds us back, it's the future; and how we undermine it, today."
22123,"Live as if you were living a second time, and as though you had acted wrongly the first time."
22124,

The Loser is always part of the problem.
The Winner always has a program.
The Loser always has an excuse.
The Winner says, ""Let me do it for you.""
The Loser says, ""That's not my job.""
The Winner sees an answer for every problem.
The Loser sees a problem for every answer.
The Winner sees a green near every sand trap
The Loser sees two or three sand traps near every green.

22139,"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. Every job is a self portrait of the person who did it ... Autograph your work with excellence."
22140,"Winning is not a sometime thing; it's an all time thing. You don't win once in a while, you don't do things right once in a while, you do them right all the time. Winning is habit. Unfortunately, so is losing."
22141,"True perfection is unattainable, but if you chase perfection you will catch excellence!"
22142,Everyone Has A Will To Win But Very Few Have The Will To Prepare To Win

22174,"What am I in the eyes of most people - a nonentity, an eccentric, or an unpleasant person - somebody who has no position in society and will never have; in short, the lowest of the low.

I am not going to traumatize my child about her hair. I want her to love her hair."

I am so many things in so many ways and I will never see myself on screen. And the reason I will never see myself up on screen is because that does not translate with being black."
22196,"You have two stark choices when you find yourself in a really desperate situation. You can either fold and cave-in to it or you can become really passionate about getting out of it. When you're really passionate, you're going to grab hold of every rope you see, and wrap them around your arms and legs to claw your way out. And that's the way I've felt in my life."

22215,People prefer the certainty of misery to the misery of uncertainty
22216,"It is now clear to me that the family is a microcosm of the world. To understand the world, we can study the family: issues such as power, intimacy, autonomy, trust, and communication skills are vital parts underlying how we live in the world. To change the world is to change the family."
22217,"Every word, facial expression, gesture, or action on the part of a parent gives the child some message about self-worth. It is sad that so many parents don't realize what messages they are sending."

22222,"I regard (parenting) as the hardest, most complicated, anxiety-ridden, sweat-and-blood-producing job in the world.

22228,"Over the years I have developed a picture of what a human being living humanely is like. She is a person who understand, values and develops her body, finding it beautiful and useful; a person who is real and is willing to take risks, to be creative, to manifest competence, to change when the situation calls for it, and to find ways to accommodate to what is new and different, keeping that part of the old that is still useful and discarding what is not."

22237,A feminist is any woman who tells the truth about her life

22242,"Let us simmer over our incalculable cauldron, our enthralling confusion, our hotchpotch of impulses, our perpetual miracle - for the soul throws up wonders every second. Movement and change are the essence of our being; rigidity is death; conformity is death; let us say what comes into our heads, repeat ourselves, contradict ourselves, fling out the wildest nonsense, and follow the most fantastic fancies without caring what the world does or thinks or says. For nothing matters except life."

22254,
22255,People who are very beautiful make their own laws.
22256,My birth sign is Scorpio and they eat themselves up and burn themselves out. I swing between happiness and misery. I am part prude and part nonconformist. I say what I think and I don't pretend and I am prepared to accept the consequences of my actions.
22257,"I'm not a film star; I am an actress. Being a film star is such a false life, lived for fake values and for publicity."
22258,Sometimes I dread the truth of the lines I say. But the dread must never show.
22259,"I cannot let well enough alone. I get restless. I have to be doing different things. I am a very impatient person and headstrong. If I've made up my mind to do something, I can't be persuaded out of it."

22269,I've always been mad about cats.
22270,"In Britain, an attractive woman is somehow suspect. If there is talent as well, it is overshadowed. Beauty and brains just can't be entertained; someone has been too extravagant. This does not happen in America or on the Continent, for the looks of a woman are considered a positive advertisement for her gifts and don't detract from them."
22271,"But I remember the morning after The Mask of Virtue-which is the first play I did at the West End-that some critics saw fit to be as foolish as to say that I was a great actress. And I thought, that was a foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry. And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said-for those first notices. I find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well, and have never forgiven him."

22280,My clothes have a story. They have an identity. They have a character and a purpose. That's why they become classics. Because they keep on telling a story. They are still telling it.

22291,"Intelligence is composed mostly of imagination, insight, things that have nothing to do with reason."
22292,"The sexiest people are thinkers. Nobody's interested in somebody who's just vain with a hole in their head, talking about the latest thing - there is no latest thing. It's all rubbish."
22293,The only possible effect one can have on the world is through unpopular ideas.
22294,"It's true the punk fashion itself was iconographic: rips and dirt, safety pins, zips, slogans, and hairstyles. These motifs were so iconic in themselves - motifs of rebellion."
22295,The most erotic zone is the imagination.
22296,"Buy less, choose well & do it﻿ yourself!"
22297,I’m not terribly interested in beauty. What touches me is someone who understands herself.
22298,It is not possible for a man to be elegant without a touch of femininity.
22299,Art should never be sociological; it has got to be timeless. It's got to be your vision and how you can represent the world you see.

22311,
22312,The future is but the obsolete in reverse.
22313,"Toska - noun /ˈtō-skə/ - Russian word roughly translated as sadness, melancholia, lugubriousness. ""No single word in English renders all the shades of toska. At its deepest and most painful, it is a sensation of great spiritual anguish, often without any specific cause. At less morbid levels it is a dull ache of the soul, a longing with nothing to long for, a sick pining, a vague restlessness, mental throes, yearning. In particular cases it may be the desire for somebody of something specific, nostalgia, love-sickness. At the lowest level it grades into ennui, boredom."

We must not remember that Daniel Webster got drunk but only that he was a splendid constitutional lawyer.

The difficulty, of course, with this philosophy is that history loses its value as an incentive and example; it paints perfect man and noble nations, but it does not tell the truth."

22394,"In 1956, I shall not go to the polls. I have not registered. I believe that democracy has so far disappeared in the United States that no 'two evils' exist. There is but one evil party with two names, and it will be elected despite all I can do or say."

22399,"Oppression costs the oppressor too much if the oppressed stands up and protests. The protest need not be merely physical-the throwing of stones and bullets-if it is mental, spiritual; if it expresses itself in silent, persistent dissatisfaction, the cost to the oppressor is terrific."

Or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky, 
Or wade with naked feet along the beach just in the edge of the water, 
Or stand under the trees in the woods, 
Or talk by day with any one I love, 
Or sleep in bed at night with any one I love, 
Or watch honey bees busy around the hive of a summer forenoon... 
Or the wonderfulness of the sundown, 
Or of stars shining so quiet and bright, 
Or the exquisite delicate thin curve of the new moon in spring...
What stranger miracles are there?"

22485,"When you and I hurt deeply, what we really need is not an explanation from God but a revelation of God. We need to see how great God is; we need to recover our lost perspective on life. Things get out of proportion when we are suffering, and it takes a vision of something bigger than ourselves to get life's dimensions adjusted again"

22532,"If you would test the character of anything, you only need to enquire whether that thing leads you to God or away from God."
22533,"To bear the cross means that you refrain from doing what you have the power to do. You are qualified to fulfill your desire, yet you refrain from doing so.

Once I thought certain things delightful, now I think them vile. Once I thought other things utterly worthless, now I think them most precious. That is a change of mind, and that is repentance."

Whenever you meet someone who has really suffered; been limited, gone through things for the Lord, willing to be imprisoned by the Lord, just being satisfied with Him and nothing else, immediately you scent the fragrance. There is a savor of the Lord. Something has been crushed, something has been broken, and there is a resulting odor of sweetness."
22543,"Not by gain our life is measured, But by what we've lost 'Tis scored; 'Tis not how much wine is drunken But how much has been outpoured. For the strength of love never standeth In the sacrifice we bear; He who has the greatest suffering Ever has the most to share."

22548,"The system of fathers of the world church, the clergy system of the state church, and the pastoral system of the independent churches are all the same in nature. They are all Nicolaitans. In the Bible there are only brothers. There is the gift of a pastor, but no system of pastors. The pastoral system is man's tradition. If the children of God are not willing to return to the position of that in the beginning, no matter what they do, it will not be right."

22859,"I tried to do everything just as I would before any other match, but it was impossible."
22860,"I've still got Paul Scholes' shirt at home which I swapped with him once. When I was at Liverpool he was one of the players I liked most. Maybe he's not valued as much as he should be in England because of the style of football there and because he keeps a low profile. Perhaps he would have been more valued in Spain, where midfielders like him form part of the 'ideal.' Fans in Spain rate him very highly and I admire him a huge amount."
22861,
22862,"I pass and I move, I help you, I look for you, I stop, I raise my head, I look and, above all, I open up the pitch...The one who has the ball, is the master of the game...Thats the school of Joan Vilà, of Albert Benaiges, of Johan Cruijff, of Pep Guardiola"
22863,"Some teams can't or don't pass the ball. What are you playing for? What's the point? That's not football. Combine, pass, play. That's football - for me, at least."
22864,There are two types of football - there's physical football and football talent.
22865,"In football, the result is an impostor. You can do things really, really well but not win. There's something greater than the result, more lasting - a legacy."
22866,"Favourite stadium? I have good memories of my CL debut at Old Trafford, spectacular atmosphere. The Theatre of Dreams, as they say."
22867,In the last 15 to 20 years the best central midfielder that I have seen - the most complete - is SCHOLES
22868,"In the last 15 to 20 years the best central midfielder that I have seen — the most complete — is Scholes. I have spoken with Xabi Alonso about this many times. Scholes is a spectacular player who has everything. He can play the final pass, he can score, he is strong, he never gets knocked off the ball and he doesn’t give possession away. If he had been Spanish then maybe he would have been valued more."
22869,"In futsal, you see whether a player is really talented. You notice the small details in quality, class and tactical understanding."
22870,"I'm a footballing romantic just like Johan Cruyff. We like football that is attractive, attacking and easy on the eye. When you win playing like this it's twice as satisfying. I've always played attacking football: my footballing ideals are very clear and well defined. I've grown up at Barcelona with that style and that's the one I like. I think it's good to win like that, by taking the initiative right from the off."
22871,Maybe one small regret is that I never got to play with Paul Scholes - but I was never going to leave Barcelona and he was never going to leave Manchester United.
22872,"In England, footballers are respected more, the game is more noble, there's less cheating. Every Spaniard who goes loves it - and comes back a better player. If I had ever left it would have been to England."
22873,"I've no regrets at all, but I still think at times that I would have loved to play in England. You live football over there; it's a great culture. People respect you more; it's more difficult to find respect in Spain. There is more criticism here."
22874,To me Paul is a role model. He is the best midfielder I've seen in the last 15 or 20 years.
22875,"Leo [Messi] is the best player of all time - better than Pele, Maradona or Cruyff. There have been some great teams in history - Pele's Brazil, Cruyff's Ajax, Sacchi's Milan - but in the past 20 years this Barcelona team is the best."
22876,"Celtic, like Barcelona, are more than a football club. Our clubs are a symbol of a culture and community that has not always been made welcome in their respective countries."
22877,"The atmosphere generated by the fans in Celtic's stadium for our visit was the most impressive I've ever witnessed. The grounds of Liverpool and Manchester United are good and the hostile feeling of playing against Real Madrid in the Bernabeu is also excellent, but the atmosphere against Celtic was the best."
22878,Iniesta is easily Spain's most complete player. He has everything.
22879,I liked the Paul Ince and Roy Keane partnership Manchester United had. They would have been my team had I moved to England.
22880,"Like so many of the players, I started at La Masia at the age of 11. I can't ever imagine not playing for Barcelona, let alone not playing soccer for a career. I don't ever want to play anywhere else."
22881,"I think Barcelona and the Spanish national team have been good for soccer because there are a lot of teams that come up playing from the back : with the goalie, the defense, moving up a defender to midfield, playing attacking soccer. I think fans want to see that. They want to see beautiful soccer, a spectacle, and Barcelona does that."
22882,I don't actually watch many shows. I will either watch movies or football. I enjoy to watch games in the Premier League and will also watch movies a lot as well. That is how I relax.
22883,If he continues like this then I think Messi will be the best player in the history of football.
22884,"The way I see it, Messi is the best player in history. He is the one who changes the course of games; he's the best. There is no comparison in my view; he's the world number one and by a margin."
22885,I'd love to play at Wembley. It's special for Barça - and for everyone in football.

22903,"The Gods did not reveal, from the beginning, all things to us, but in the course of time through seeking we may learn & know things better. But as for certain truth no man knows it, nor shall he know it, neither of the Gods nor yet of all things that I speak. For even if by chance he were to utter The Final Truth, he would himself not know it: for all is but a woven web of guesses."
22904,"Even if a man should chance to speak the most complete truth, yet he himself does not know it; all things are wrapped in appearances"
22905,"There is one god, greatest among gods and men, who bears no similarity to humans either in shape or thought... but humans believe that the gods are born like themselves, and that the gods wear clothes and have bodies like humans and speak in the same way... but if cows and horses or lions had hands or could draw with the hands and manufacture the things humans can make, then horses would draw the forms of gods like horses, cows like cows, and they would make the gods' bodies resemble those which each kind of animal had itself."

22912,"The clear and perfect truth no man has seen, nor will there be anyone who knows about the gods and what I say about all things...; for, however perfect what he says may be, yet he does not know it; all things are matters of opinion."
22913,"Homer and Hesiod attributed to the gods all things which are disreputable and worthy of blame when done by men; and they told of them many lawless deeds, stealing, adultery, and deception of each other."
22914,"God is one, supreme among gods and men, and not like mortals in body or in mind.The whole [of god] sees, the whole perceives, the whole hears. But without effort he sets in motion all things by mind and thought."
22915,"In the beginning the gods did not at all reveal all things clearly to mortals, but by searching men in the course of time find them out better."
22916,All men begin their learning with Homer.
22917,"If God had not made brown honey, men would think figs much sweeter than they do."
22918,"The sea is the source of water and the source of wind; for neither would blasts of wind arise in the clouds and blow out from within them, except for the great sea, nor would the streams of rivers nor the rain-water in the sky exist but for the sea ; but the great sea is the begetter of clouds and winds and rivers."
22919,"Ethiopians imagine their gods as black and snub-nosed; Thracians blue-eyed and red-haired. But if horses or lions had hands, or could draw and fashion works as men do, horses would draw the gods shaped like horses and lions like lions, making the gods resemble themselves."

22922,"If oxen and lions had hands and could paint with their hands and produce works of art, as men do, horses would paint the forms of the gods likes horses and oxen like oxen. Each would represent them with bodies according to the bodies of each. So the Ethiopians make their gods black and snub-nosed; the Thracians give theirs red hair and blue eyes."
22923,"People always say it's harder to heal a wounded heart than a wounded body. Bullshit. It's exactly the opposite—a wounded body takes much longer to heal. A wounded heart is nothing but ashes of memories. But the body is everything. The body is blood and veins and cells and nerves. A wounded body is when, after leaving a man you’ve lived with for three years, you curl up on your side of the bed as if there’s still somebody beside you. That is a wounded body: a body that feels connected to someone who is no longer there."

22925,Its important to be comfortable with uncertainty.
22926,"I do think there will be a better understanding between the two sides - East and West. And eventually, the so-called two sides will disappear, and there will only be the conflict between those with power and those without it."
22927,"Never look back to the past, never regret, even if there is emptiness ahead.' But I couldn't help it. Sometimes I would rather look back if it meant that I could feel something in my heart, even something sad. Sadness was better than emptiness."
22928,I don't feel naked around you anymore.
22929,"I think our literary tradition has to evolve, has to explore its form and its spirit through writers and thinkers, rather than let the lazy, easy traditional narrative - which is controlled by the publishing industry - roll all over the readers and dominate the market. I think our readers and cinemagoers have been trained to read and watch very mainstream stuff. It's like being given sleeping pills. It sends people to a non-reflective sleep state."
22930,"I thought English is a strange language. Now I think French is even more strange. In France, their fish is poisson, their bread is pain, and their pancake is crepe. Pain and poison and crap. That's what they have every day."
22931,"I’m saying language is a passport. A dubious, dangerous passport too."
22932,"About time, what I really learned from studying English is: time is different with timing. I understand the difference of these two words so well. I understand falling in love with the right person in the wrong timing could be the greatest sadness in a person's entire life."
22933,"Self-censorship happens not only in China, or Iran or ex-Soviet places. It can happen anywhere. If an artist penetrates a certain taboo or a certain power through their work, he or she will face this problem. I'm always saying that commercial censorship is our foremost censorship globally today. Why do we still pretend we are free?"
22934,"It's not a choice. Either I write or I don't, especially when I'm in a foreign culture. I've lived in London for years, and I must continue my writing and filmmaking. The most important thing for an artist or an author is to continue her work. Languages and settings are the tools but not the first thing."
22935,"Huizi would say, never look back to the past. Never regret. Even if there is emptiness ahead, never look back."
22936,"But why people need privacy? Why privacy is important? In China, every family live together, grandparents, parents, daughter, son and their relatives too. Eat together and share everything, talk about everything. Privacy make people lonely. Privacy make family fallen apart."
22937,"Somehow, in the novel format, I don't really like to do upfront, ideological discussion. In my heart, literature remains a poetic and ambiguous medium. On the other hand, I trained as a documentary filmmaker in film school, so my films very much reflect reality and socio-political problems. They're less subtle I would say."
22938,"There was - there still is - a big shortage of good Chinese-English literary translators. So for two years in London, I was stuck waiting, not writing, with several Chinese books I couldn't get translated. That's when I decided to write in English, since I had been living here and had decided to reconstruct my life here. Even if I wrote in broken English, it was better than getting bored and weary and bitter on the long queue of authors waiting to be translated by a stranger."

22943,"Russian men have a saying: ""Women are like buses..."" That's it."
22944,"Many people are surprised to hear that we have comedians in Russia, but they are there. They are dead, but they are there."
22945,"Homosexuality in Russia is a crime and the punishment is seven years in prison, locked up with the other men. There is a three year waiting list."
22946,The reason gas prices are so high is because the oil is in Texas and Oklahoma and all the dipsticks are in Washington.
22947,I like American women. They do things sexually Russian girls never dream of doing - like showering.
22948,"In America, you assassinate president. In Soviet Russia, president assassinate you!"
22949,Everybody laughs the same in every language because laughter is a universal connection.
22950,I believe that laughter is a language of God and that we can all live happily ever laughter.
22951,"In America, your job determines your marks. In Soviet Russia, Marx determine your job!"
22952,"In Russia, if a male athelete loses he becomes a female athelete."
22953,"I found out that when you get married the man becomes the head of the house. And the woman becomes the neck, and she turns the head any way she wants to."
22954,The ad in the paper said 'Big Sale. Last Week.' Why advertise? I already missed it. They're just rubbing it in.
22955,I believe that love and laughter can only happen when one person takes the time to think about what would cause the other person to feel good.

22962,"We have been learning since we were children how to make money, buy things, build things. The whole education system is set up to teach us how to think, not to feel."
22963,In today's society we sometimes forget to balance our hearts and our heads; this is the reason we stop laughing.
22964,"There is something to be learned from a rainstorm. When meeting with a sudden shower, you try not to get wet and run quickly along the road. But doing such things as passing under the eaves of houses, you still get wet. When you are resolved from the beginning, you will not be perplexed, though you will still get the same soaking. This understanding extends to everything."
22965,A warrior is worthless unless he rises above others and stands strong in the midst of a storm.
22966,"There is surely nothing other than the single purpose of the present moment. A man's whole life is a succession of moment after moment. There will be nothing else to do, and nothing else to pursue. Live being true to the single purpose of the moment."
22967,"Nothing is impossible in this world. Firm determination, it is said, can move heaven and earth. Things appear far beyond one's power, because one cannot set his heart on any arduous project due to want of strong will."
22968,"Meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily. Every day when one’s body and mind are at peace, one should meditate upon being ripped apart by arrows, rifles, spears and swords, being carried away by surging waves, being thrown into the midst of a great fire, being struck by lightning, being shaken to death by a great earthquake, falling from thousand-foot cliffs, dying of disease or committing seppuku at the death of one’s master. And every day without fail one should consider himself as dead"

22971,One should make his decisions within the space of seven breaths.
22972,Light matters should be dealt with seriously. Serious matters should be dealt with lightly.
22973,"Even if it seems certain that you will lose, retaliate. Neither wisdom nor technique has a place in this. A real man does not think of victory or defeat. He plunges recklessly towards an irrational death. By doing this, you will awaken from your dreams."
22974,"Everyone lets the present moment slip by, then looks for it as though he thought it were somewhere else."
22975,Human life is truly a short affair. It is better to live doing the things that you like.

He was probably a man who always spoke big words but acted differently when facing the real thing."

22986,"It is a good viewpoint to see the world as a dream. When you have something like a nightmare, you will wake up and tell yourself that it was only a dream. It is said that the world we live in is not a bit different from this."

23011,I will keep working hard!
23012,I think to be 'tough' means you look relaxed. So you have to be tough to win tournaments. But you don't want to be so tough on yourself.

23022,Reality is how we interpret it. Imagination and volition play a part in that interpretation. Which means that all reality is to some extent a fiction.
23023,"I had to stop hoping so much that a ship would rescue me. I should not count on outside help. Survival had to start with me. In my experience, a castaway’s worst mistake is to hope too much and to do too little. Survival starts by paying attention to what is close at hand and immediate. To look out with idle hope is tantamount to dreaming one’s life away."
23024,"Fiction and nonfiction are not so easily divided. Fiction may not be real, but it's true; it goes beyond the garland of facts to get to emotional and psychological truths. As for nonfiction, for history, it may be real, but its truth is slippery, hard to access, with no fixed meaning bolted to it. If history doesn't become story, it dies to everyone except the historian."

23029,"I must say a word about fear. It is life's only true opponent. Only fear can defeat life. It is a clever, treacherous adversary, how well I know. It has no decency, respects no law or convention, shows no mercy. It goes for your weakest spot, which it finds with unerring ease. It begins in your mind, always. One moment you are feeling calm, self-possessed, happy. Then fear, disguised in the garb of mild-mannered doubt, slips into your mind like a spy."
23030,"A realization that the founding principle of existence is what we call love, which works itself out sometimes not clearly, not cleanly, not immediately, nonetheless ineluctably."
23031,"If Christ spent an anguished night in prayer, if He burst out from the Cross, ""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"" then surely we are also permitted doubt. But we must move on. To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation."

23036,"I was giving up. I would have given up - if a voice hadn't made itself heard in my heart. The voice said ""I will not die. I refuse it. I will make it through this nightmare. I will beat the odds, as great as they are. I have survived so far, miraculously. Now I will turn miracle into routine. The amazing will be seen everyday. I will put in all the hard work necessary.

23041,This life will never be without storms. Stop fearing the storm. Build your inner shelter.
23042,"We often wonder why God gives and takes, constricts and expands. What we forget is that human beings understand things by their opposites. Without dark, we can’t understand light. Without hardship, we wouldn’t *experience* ease. Without the existence of deprivation and loss, we couldn’t grasp the need for gratitude or the virtue of patience. And without separation, we wouldn’t taste the sweetness of reunion. Glory be to the one who gives—even when He takes."
23043,"You can search the world over, but you won’t find happiness until you realize that happiness 
 isn’t getting what you want. It’s being content with what you already have."
23044,"I tell you to keep going, not because it's easy. Not because it doesn't hurt. I tell you to keep going because there's no other way. To stop is to die. Life is in motion. In growth. In change. Life is in seeking and in finding. Life is in redemption. Each moment is a new birth. A new chance to come back, to get it right. 
 A new chance to make it better."
23045,"Holding on to hope when everything is dark, is the greatest test of faith"
23046,"How could you feel worthless when God has honoured you by creating you and choosing you to be with Him, in this life and the next? You are worthy. You are worthy of love. You are worthy of respect. You haven't failed. You're beautiful. Only the beautiful can see beauty. Never doubt your beauty. Never doubt your worth. It's not about how much you make, your grades, what people say or think. It's about you and God. It's about your heart. The blinding beauty of your heart."
23047,Everything you have is on loan. Foolish is the one who gets attached to a loan.
23048,The body has many needs. But the soul has only one: to be with God.
23049,"People think that tests only come in the form of hardships. Allah also tests us with ease, it's often in the test of ease that we fail most."
23050,"Stop hating on yourself for not being perfect. If God wanted perfection, He would have made you an angel."
23051,"Try not to confuse attachment with love. Attachment is about fear and dependency, and has more to do with love of self than love of another. Love without attachment is the purest love because it isn't about what others can give you because your empty. It is about what you can give others because you're already full."
23052,"If you want this life to stop breaking your heart, stop giving your heart to this life."
23053,"Just as storms change the landscape of the earth, our hardships change the landscape of the heart."

23057,Beware of what you let enter your heart. There will come a day when you'd give anything to remove it.
23058,"There’s something amazing about this life. The very same worldly attribute that causes us pain is also what gives us relief: Nothing here lasts. What does that mean? It means that the breathtakingly beautiful rose in my vase will wither tomorrow. It means that my youth will neglect me. But it also means that the sadness I feel today will change tomorrow. My pain will die. My laughter won’t last forever but neither will my tears. We say this life isn’t perfect. And it isn’t. It isn’t perfectly good. But, it also isn’t perfectly bad, either."
23059,"Tawbah is the cleaning of the heart, dhikr is the feeding of the heart."
23060,"To all those broken or hopeless, I have learned this: Be grateful for every single person who was part of your story. The ones that hurt you. The ones that helped you. The ones that came, and the ones that left. They all taught you. Don't think for a moment that any of it was random. There are no oversights with God. Only perfectly crafted chapters in each unique journey."
23061,"Blessings come in packages of two. With every blessing is a test. So don't ever envy people who seem to have more than you. The more blessings, the more tests. And the greater the blessing, the harder the test."
23062,There's a special place in my heart for the ones who were with me at my lowest and still loved me when I wasn't very loveable.
23063,Sometimes the gifts of God aren't wrapped as we expect.

23066,"Put your soul in the palm of my hand for me to look at, like a crystal jewel. I'll sketch it in words."
23067,Our language is primarily for expressing human goodness and beauty.
23068,"Seeing the moon, he becomes the moon, the moon seen by him becomes him. He sinks into nature, becomes one with nature. The light of the ""clear heart"" of the priest, seated in the meditation hall in the darkness before the dawn, becomes for the dawn moon its own light."
23069,"The labor into which a heart has poured its whole love--where will it have its say, to excite and inspire, and when?"
23070,The road was frozen. The village lay quiet under the cold sky. Komako hitched up the skirt of her kimono and tucked it into her obi. The moon shone like a blade frozen in blue ice.
23071,"Because you cannot see him, God is everywhere."
23072,I suppose even a woman's hatred is a kind of love.
23073,"A secret, if it's kept, can be sweet and comforting, but once it leaks out it can turn on you with a vengeance."
23074,"Lunatics have no age. If we were crazy, you and I, we might be a great deal younger."
23075,People have separated from each other with walls of concrete that blocked the roads to connection and love. and Nature has been defeated in the name of development.
23076,"In the depths of the mirror the evening landscape moved by, the mirror and the reflected figures like motion pictures superimposed one on the other. The figures and the background were unrelated, and yet the figures, transparent and intangible, and the background, dim in the gathering darkness, melted into a sort of symbolic world not of this world. Particularly when a light out in the mountains shone in the center of the girl's face, Shimamura felt his chest rise at the inexpressible beauty of it."
23077,"It's remarkable how we go on year after year, doing the same old things. We get tired and bored, and ask when they'll come for us"
23078,"Now, even more than the evening before, he could think of no one with whom to compare her. She had become absolute, beyond comparison. She had become decision and fate."
23079,"The woman was silent, her eyes on the floor. Shimamura had come to a point where he knew he was only parading his masculine shamelessness, and yet it seemed likely enough that the woman was familiar with the failing and need not be shocked by it. He looked at her. Perhaps it was the rich lashes of the downcast eyes that made her face seem warm and sensuous. She shook her head very slightly, and again a faint blush spread over her face."
23080,"Does pain go away and leave no trace, then?’ ‘You sometimes even feel sentimental for it."
23081,"And I can't complain. After all, only women are able really to love."
23082,"The snow on the distant mountains was soft and creamy, as if veiled in a faint smoke."
23083,"A child walked by, rolling a metal hoop that made a sound of autumn."

23086,"They were words that came out of nothing, but they seemed to him somehow significant. He muttered them over again."
23087,"Maybe vagueness has been good for me. The word means two different things in Tokyo and Osaka, you know. In Tokyo it means stupidity, but in Osaka they talk about vagueness in a painting and in a game of Go."
23088,"The sound of the freezing of snow over the land seemed to roar deep into the earth. There was no moon. The stars, almost too many of them to be true, came forward so brightly that it was as if they were falling with the swiftness of the void. As the stars came nearer, the sky retreated deeper and deeper into the night color. The layers of the Border Range, indistinguishable one from another, cast their heaviness at the skirt of the starry sky in a blackness grave and somber enough to communicate their mass. The whole of the night scene came together in a clear, tranquil harmony."
23089,
23090,"Hurt people hurt people. That's how pain patterns gets passed on, generation after generation after generation. Break the chain today.

23097,"On one hand, we know that everything happens for a reason, and there are no mistakes or coincidences. On the other hand, we learn that we can never give up, knowing that with the right tools and energy, we can reverse any decree or karma. So, which is it? Let the Light decide, or never give up? The answer is: both."
23098,"When you’re truly connecting with wisdom, the more you learn, the more you realize the less you know."
23099,"Uniting two halves of one soul is inevitable, but timing depends upon your level of spirituality. When the time is ripe, true soul mates find one another even if they are worlds apart— whether physically, on opposite sides of the globe, or spiritually, with contrasting lifestyles and backgrounds. Here’s wishing you the courage to keep growing so that you may know – or continue to know – the blessing of oneness."
23100,"Be the kind of person you want to be with... If you don't like the people in your life, you are the one who has to change, not them."
23101,"At the end of the day, the key to happiness is taking ultimate responsibility for your reactions to all of your experiences - the good and the chaotic."
23102,God never answers prayers. It is people who answer their own prayers by knowing how to connect and utilize the divine energy of the Creator and the God-like force in their own souls.

23105,Healing is a choice. It’s not an easy one because it takes work to turn around your habits. But keep making the choice and shifts will happen.
23106,If we are going to be happy and have any chance at growing then we must learn how to forgive others ... and ourselves.
23107,"Our good nature and endearing qualities will not arouse the answers to our prayers. Rather it is our mischievous, dishonest attributes that provide the master keys to heaven. When we identify and work to transform our self-centered qualities and crooked characteristics, the key turns and the gates unlock. Blessings and good fortune are now free to rain down upon us."
23108,"Your garbage, transformed, is your gift."
23109,"If we each take responsibility in shifting our own behavior, we can trigger the type of change that is necessary to achieve sustainability for our race or this planet. We change our planet, our environment, our humanity every day, every year, every decade, and every millennia."
23110,"The more we invest in our spirituality, the more consistently we can elevate our consciousness and connect to the spiritual source of everything good."
23111,"Always run after opportunities to create peace between people, to find ways to bridge differences, please. Because as long as one person continues to feel separation… …we'll all still feel it. Close the space between you and someone today. Seeing their essential goodness helps a lot."
23112,"Loving one another isn’t enough to make a relationship last. The real glue that holds a couple (or friends or family) together is the effort both put into helping others who are in need of financial, health, personal or emotional assistance. Today, sustain your connection to a loved one by finding ways you both can help others, with a genuine heart."

23125,"Sorrow happens, hardship happens, the hell with it, who never knew the price of happiness, will not be happy."
23126,"Everything I do, I do on the principle of Russian borscht. You can throw everything into it beets, carrots, cabbage, onions, everything you want. What's important is the result, the taste of the borscht."

23132,"Be equal to your talent, not your age. At times let the gap between them be embarrassing."
23133,"I do not like poems that resemble hay compressed into a geometrically perfect cube. I like it when the hay, unkempt, uncombed, with dry berries mixed in it, thrown together gaily and freely, bounces along atop some truck-and more, if there are some lovely and healthy lasses atop the hay-and better yet if the branches catch at the hay, and some of it tumbles to the road."
23134,"No people are uninteresting. Their fate is like the chronicles of planets. Nothing in them is not particular, and planet is dissimilar from planet."
23135,Only when the sense of the pain of others begins does man begin
23136,But time has a way of demonstrating the most stubborn are the most intelligent.
23137,Character begins to form at the first pinch of anxiety about ourselves.
23138,"Why is it that right-wing bastards always stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity, while liberals fall out among themselves?"
23139,
23140,"It is an error to divide people into the living and the dead: there are people who are dead-alive, and people who are alive-alive. The dead-alive also write, walk, speak, act. But they make no mistakes; only machines make no mistakes, and they produce only dead things. The alive-alive are constantly in error, in search, in questions, in torment."
23141,Heretics are the only bitter remedy against the entropy of human thought.
23142,We have lived through the epoch of suppression of the masses; we are living in an epoch of suppression of the individual in the name of the masses; tomorrow will bring the liberation of the individual - in the name of man.
23143,I prefer being wrong in my own way to being right in someone else's.
23144,"Children are the only brave philosophers. And brave philosophers are, inevitably, children."
23145,"Those two, in paradise, were given a choice: happiness without freedom, or freedom without happiness. There was no third alternative."
23146,There is no final one; revolutions are infinite.
23147,"Knowledge! What does that mean? Your knowledge is nothing but cowardice. No, really, that's all it is. You just want to put a little wall around infinity. And you're afraid to look on the other side of that wall."
23148,"There are books of the same chemical composition as dynamite. The only difference is that a piece of dynamite explodes once, whereas a book explodes a thousand times."
23149,"Children are the boldest philosophers. They enter life naked, not covered by the smallest fig leaf of dogma, absolutes, creeds. This is why every question they ask is so absurdly naïve and so frighteningly complex."
23150,You're in bad shape. It looks like you're developing a soul.
23151,"Knowledge, absolutely sure of its infallibility, is faith."
23152,A man is like a novel: until the very last page you don't know how it will end. Otherwise it wouldn't be worth reading.
23153,"I am aware of myself. And, of course, the only things that are aware of themselves and conscious of their individuality are irritated eyes, cut fingers, sore teeth. A healthy eye, finger, tooth might as well not even be there. Isn't it clear that individual consciousness is just sickness?"
23154,"All truths are erroneous. This is the very essence of the dialectical process: today's truths become errors tomorrow; there is no final number. This truth (the only one) is for the strong alone. Weak-nerved minds insist on a finite universe, a last number; they need, in Nietzsche's words, ""the crutches of certainty"". The weak-nerved lack the strength to include themselves in the dialectic syllogism."
23155,There is an excellent way to make predictions without the slightest risk of error: predict the past.
23156,"We need writers who fear nothing. (""Our Goal"")"
23157,"Let the answers be wrong, let the philosophy be mistaken - errors are more valuable than truths: truth is of the machine, error is alive; truth reassures, error disturbs."
23158,"Crossing out is an art that is, perhaps, even more difficult than writing. It requires the sharpest eye to decide what is superfluous and must be removed. And it requires ruthlessness toward yourself -- the greatest ruthlessness and self-sacrifice. You must know how to sacrifice parts in the name of the whole."
23159,"You're in a bad way! Apparently, you have developed a soul."
23160,"The whole world is one immense woman, and we are in her very womb, we are not yet born, we are joyfully ripening."
23161,All truths are erroneous. This is the very essence of the dialectical process: today's truths become errors tomorrow; there is no final number.
23162,The most wonderful thing in life is to be delirious and the most wonderful kind of delirium is being in love.
23163,"Now I no longer live in our clear, rational world; I live in the ancient nightmare world, the world of square roots of minus one."
23164,
23165,"Music enhances the education of our children by helping them to make connections and broadening the depth with which they think and feel. If we are to hope for a society of culturally literate people, music must be a vital part of our children's education."
23166,"Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks."
23167,Nobody else can make the sound you make.
23168,"As you begin to realize that every different type of music, everybody's individual music, has its own rhythm, life, language and heritage, you realize how life changes, and you learn how to be more open and adaptive to what is around us."
23169,"The worst thing you can do is say to yourself, ""I want to be just like somebody else."" You have to absorb knowledge from someone else, but ultimately you have to find your own voice."
23170,"When we enlarge our view of the world, we deepen our understanding of our own lives."
23171,I think one of the great things about being a musician is that you never stop learning.
23172,Each day I move toward that which I do not understand. The result is a continuous accidental learning which constantly shapes my life.
23173,Sharing is a much better way to communicate than proving.
23174,"Culture opens our hearts to one another. And the currency in culture is not money, but trust."
23175,Music is one of the ways we can achieve a kind of shorthand to understand each other.
23176,"I play an instrument that has four strings, and I'm still trying to get it right. What I've tried to do in the process of playing these four strings is to try and understand the people I meet, the stories they have to tell. And then become an advocate for them and their stories through music."
23177,"Bach takes you to a very quiet place within yourself, to the inner core, a place where you are calm and at peace."
23178,When we have a good balance between thinking and feeling... our actions and lives are always the richer for it.
23179,"You must have a reason to be in the places to which you go, and you must do only things that you really care about."
23180,"Classical music is one of the best things that ever happened to mankind. If you get introduced to it in the right way, it becomes your friend for life."
23181,"In performance, we have a greater purpose. The greater purpose is that we're communing together, and we want this moment to be really special for all of us. Because otherwise, why bother to have come at all? It's not about proving anything. It's about sharing something."
23182,"A Senegalese poet said 'In the end we will conserve only what we love. We love only what we understand, and we will understand only what we are taught.' We must learn about other cultures in order to understand, in order to love, and in order to preserve our common world heritage."
23183,"But an innovation, to grow organically from within, has to be based on an intact tradition, so our idea is to bring together musicians who represent all these traditions, in workshops, festivals, and concerts, to see how we can connect with each other in music."
23184,Perfection is not very communicative
23185,"I have yet to find something that beats the power of being in love, or the power of music at its most magical."
23186,Our cultural strength has always been derived from our diversity of understanding and experience.
23187,I remember when I was growing up. My great wish was to understand who I was and how I fit in the world.
23188,"When you learn something from people, or from a culture, you accept it as a gift, and it is your lifelong commitment to preserve it and build on it."
23189,
23190,"No Buddhist, no Christian, no Hindu. Deeply religious people have no religion. They belong to no seat, theirs is the religion of the heart!"
23191,"Happiness and sorrow are twins, let them come and go like clouds."
23192,Ill health is also a blessing. The flesh and the ego are weakened and contemplation of God becomes easier.
23193,Why do you want to open the outside door when there is an inside door?
23194,

23199,Make a game plan and stick to it. Unless it's not working.

23201,You can observe a lot by just watching.
23202,In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is.
23203,The future ain't what it used to be.
23204,"If you're feeling good, don't worry. You'll get over it."
23205,

23209,I'd give my right arm to be ambidextrous.
23210,
23211,Laughter is the shock absorber that eases the blows of life.

23213,"If you don't know where you're going, when you get there you'll be lost."
23214,I don't want to make the wrong mistake.
23215,"Nothing is like it seems, but everything is exactly like it is."

23218,"You can get old pretty young if you don't 
 take care of yourself."
23219,
23220,Black is modest and arrogant at the same time. Black is lazy and easy - but mysterious. [...] But above all black says this: 'I don't bother you - don't bother me'
23221,A beautiful flower does not exist. There's only a moment when a flower looks beautiful.

23225,"Clothing doesn’t lie, it shows everything."
23226,"Colour disturbs people. I am confident in black, not in light. This dark side of life is attractive to me forever and from the beginning. I am a lazy designer when it comes to colour."
23227,"It meant something to me – the idea of a coat guarding and hiding a woman’s body. For me, a woman who is absorbed in her work, who does not care about gaining one’s favor, strong yet subtle at the same time, is essentially more seductive. The more she hides and abandons her femininity, the more it emerges from the very heart of her existence."
23228,"Dirty, stained, withered, broken things seem beautiful to me."
23229,"I hate fashion. Or the word fashion, which sounds colorful, extravagant, expensive and gorgeous. “I never wanted to walk the main street of fashion. I have been walking the sidewalks of fashion from the beginning, so I’m a bit dark."
23230,My role in all of this is very simple. I make clothing like armor. My clothing protects you from unwelcome eyes.
23231,"The more we possess, the more distant we grow from God."
23232,"Fashion is only complete when it is worn by ordinary people who exist now, managing their lives, loving and grieving."
23233,You can say that designing is quite easy; the difficulty lies in finding a new way to explore beauty
23234,"Men's clothing is more pure in design. It's more simple and has no decoration. Women want that. When I started designing, I wanted to make men's clothes for women. But there were no buyers for it. Now there are. I always wonder who decided that there should be a difference in the clothes of men and women. Perhaps men decided this."
23235,A pair of brilliantly cut cotton trousers can be more beautiful than a gorgeous silk gown.
23236,"I want to achieve anti-fashion through fashion. That's why I'm always heading in my own direction, in parallel to fashion."
23237,"I always want to have a new challenge involved. I need to put myself to the test, and if I make mistakes, it doesn't matter. What matters to me, instead, is making my dreams come true and putting them on display."
23238,Just listen to the material. What is it going to say? Just wait. Probably the material will tell you something.

23240,Beautiful things are disappearing every day.
23241,"I believe that there are three conditions to a woman’s beauty. First, you must realize that not all women are beautiful all of the time. Sometimes beauty comes on a subconscious level. When she is in love, or has met someone new and exciting, she shines. Second, you must understand that life is unfair. Beauty is something that, for some, must be worked at. The third condition is luck. Some women can just be lucky."
23242,Black is modest and arrogant at the same time.
23243,I don’t think we should try to make space our own. I believe that as modern people we should live in mobility. We should always be moving.

23255,"You may think I’m small, but I have a universe inside my mind."
23256,"I really feel that artists or musicians are controversial people. Controversy is part of the nature of art and creativity. If people are not doing that, they're not artists - they're artisans."
23257,
23258,"Try to say nothing negative about anybody for three days, for forty-five days, for three months. See what happens to your life."
23259,"It's difficult to explain love. You want to explain water? You need a book for it. There are many different ways to explain what water is. Love is big, it's very big. I know that I have tons of it. But maybe we don't want to open up so much, and we think, maybe we don't have so much, but yes, you know that you have tons of love. We all do. Through that love we can connect, we can heal each other, we can make people, all of us, happy, joyful, and make a better world."

 See what they reveal to you."
23265,The regret of my life is that I have not said 'I love you' often enough.
23266,Tape the sound of friends laughing together. Save it for a rainy day.
23267,"Most people think that I am too optimistic, but my optimism is based on the thought that negative thinking is a luxury that we can't afford."
23268,"Everybody's an artist. Everybody's God. It's just that they're inhibited. I believe in people so much that if the whole of civilization is burned so we don't have any memory of it, even then people will start to build their own art. It is a necessity -- a function. We don't need history."
23269,"In parting, I would like to give you one small piece of advice to keep in your heart. You may have heard me say this before, but it is the key point of the entire path, so it bears repeating: All that we are looking for in life — all the happiness, contentment, and peace of mind — is right here in the present moment. Our very own awareness is itself fundamentally pure and good. The only problem is that we get so caught up in the ups and downs of life that we don’t take the time to pause and notice what we already have."
23270,"Ultimately, happiness comes down to choosing between the discomfort of becoming aware of your mental afflictions and the discomfort of being ruled by them."
23271,"If you're determined to think of yourself as limited, fearful, vulnerable, or scarred by past experience, know only that you have chosen to do so. The opportunity to experience yourself differently is always available."
23272,"All that we are looking for in life - all the happiness, contentment, and peace of mind - is right here in the present moment."
23273,"If we could see the whole truth of any situation, our only response would be one of compassion."
23274,"Simply notice that you're aware. At any given moment, you can choose to follow the chain of thoughts, emotions, and sensations that reinforce a perception of yourself as vulnerable and limited, or to remember that your true nature is pure, unconditioned, and incapable of being harmed."
23275,"Meditation is really quite simple. All we have to do is embrace each experience with awareness and open our hearts fully to the present moment. When we are completely at ease with our own being, the ripples of awareness naturally spread out in all directions, touching the lives of everyone we meet."
23276,"If you don’t try to stop whatever is going on in your mind, but merely observe it, eventually you’ll begin to feel a tremendous sense of relaxation, a vast sense of openness within your mind - which is in fact your natural mind, the naturally unperturbed background against which various thoughts come and go."
23277,"Happiness and unhappiness are not primarily created by the material world or the physical body. First and foremost, they are decisions of the mind."
23278,"When you transform your mind, everything you experience is transformed."
23279,"Meditation is actually a very simple exercise in resting in the natural state of your present mind, and allowing yourself to be simply and clearly present to whatever thoughts, sensations, or emotions occur."
23280,"The mind is the source of all experience, and by changing the direction of the mind, we can change the quality of everything we experience."
23281,When we become fixed in our perceptions we lose our ability to fly.
23282,"So overall, though my life is far from perfect, I'm contented with it. And in a peculiar way, I'm grateful for the troubling emotions I experienced. The obstacles we face in life can provide powerful incentives for change."
23283,"Compassion is the spontaneous wisdom of the heart. It's always with us. It always has been, and always will be. When it arises in us, we've simply learned to see how strong and safe we really are."
23284,There's no difference between what is seen and the mind that sees it.
23285,"You don't want to block your thoughts, emotions, and so on; nor do you want to chase after them. If you chase after them, if you let them lead you, they begin to define you, and you lose your ability to respond openly and spontaneously in the present moment. On the other hand, if you attempt to block your thoughts, your mind can become quite tight and small."
23286,The opportunity to experience yourself differently is always available.
23287,Within our perceived weaknesses and imperfections lies the key to realizing our true strength.
23288,"Any attempt to capture the direct experience of the nature of mind in words is impossible. The best that can be said is that it is immeasurably peaceful and, once stabilized through repeated experience, virtually unshakable. It's an experience of absolute well-being that radiates through all physical, emotional and mental states-even those that might ordinarily be labeled as unpleasant."
23289,"Being human means having power; specifically, the power to accomplish whatever we want."
23290,Compassion is the spontaneous wisdom of the heart.
23291,"It’s so easy to think that we’re the only ones who suffer, while other people are somehow immune to pain, as though they’d been born with some kind of special knowledge about being happy, that, through some cosmic accident, we never received. Thinking in this way, we make our own problems seem much bigger than they really are."
23292,We're all buddhas. We just don't recognize it.
23293,Not recognizing natural mind is simply an example of the mind's unlimited capacity to create whatever it wants.
23294,
23295,
23296,
23297,"Let's say your past is your present and your present is your cash, So I look forward to the future."
23298,My hustle is nonstop. I never stop hustling.
23299,"I used to hit the kitchen lights, cockroaches everywhere.
Hit the kitchen lights, now it's marble floors everywhere."
23300,"Real recognize real, I suppose."
23301,I think I got a lot of life skills; I got a lot of wisdom; I've seen a lot of bad things happen to a lot of good people.
23302,"Anybody that's got a problem with me is probably envious or wants to be me, and that's how I've always looked at it."
23303,"Everyday, all day I have to be productive. And when I ain't productive, I get concerned."
23304,"Sometimes when people get success they forget about the people that pointed them there or championed them into this position. I pride myself on really understanding. I wouldn't even call it keeping it real. I just call it keeping it me. When they tell me, ""You're doing what you're supposed to do,"" it makes me go ten times even harder, because I know that there are people on the sidelines and they're watching me. They're cheering for me. I want to be the best me I could possibly be when it comes to them."
23305,"I just think a hustler's ambition is that I never stop. I start off hustling and said I'll never stop hustling. An ambitious hustler is the one to hustle the hustlers. When I grew up, my heroes were hustlers. Now I'm their hero."
23306,"Love don't love nobody got me feeling like, I shouldn't love myself"
23307,"You gotta have life your way. If you ain't losing your mind, you ain't partying right."
23308,Anything that looks good makes you feel better.
23309,"You've got to be happy with yourself. You can't sell yourself if you're out here and you ain't good. Because you're giving people messages, and if your message is wrong, then it's like the blind leading the blind."
23310,"Anybody that I ever dealt with knows that I'm a very focused individual, and when it comes to my work and what I do, you might have to play the back burner to that."
23311,I never wanted to be a statistic. I never wanted to be that cat who tried and never made it.
23312,"Sexy, no alcoholic, but she drink like a toilet. Told her do me a favor and put your mouth on this faucet."
23313,"I love the streets, and the streets love me back. And when things ain't going the way they should go, they let you know... and when they happy, you gotta keep 'em happy."
23314,"A lot of things come with fame, whether it's losing friends or losing family. You still gotta stand up and be that guy even when you ain't having great things. Because you've gotta be the spokesperson for your people."
23315,"When money was plentiful, I was the first one who told you to stack it. Live your life with it. Now that money slowed up, I'ma be the one telling you to save it like they ain't gon' make it no more."
23316,"If I'm gonna put a message out there, I want to make sure I stay consistent. I'm up on my game, because I said it. People take your words and they live by them."
23317,I could sit right here and have a 15-minute conversation with somebody and change their whole life.
23318,I ain't a rapper; I'm a motivational speaker. I don't do shows; I do seminars. I really talk to people.
23319,
23320,Perfect purity is possible if you turn your life into a line of poetry written with a splash of blood.
23321,Beauty is something that burns the hand when you touch it.
23322,"The highest point at which human life and art meet is in the ordinary. To look down on the ordinary is to despise what you can't have. Show me a man who fears being ordinary, and I'll show you a man who is not yet a man."
23323,"Young people get the foolish idea that what is new for them must be new for everybody else too. No matter how unconventional they get, they're just repeating what others before them have done."
23324,"As long as you know I am waiting, take your time flowers of the spring."
23325,"Dreams, memories, the sacred--they are all alike in that they are beyond our grasp. Once we are even marginally separated from what we can touch, the object is sanctified; it acquires the beauty of the unattainable, the quality of the miraculous. Everything, really, has this quality of sacredness, but we can desecrate it at a touch. How strange man is! His touch defiles and yet he contains the source of miracles."
23326,Living is merely the chaos of existence.
23327,We live in an age in which there is no heroic death.
23328,Nobody even imagines how well one can lie about the state of one’s own heart.
23329,"What transforms this world is - knowledge. Do you see what I mean? Nothing else can change anything in this world. Knowledge alone is capable of transforming the world, while at the same time leaving it exactly as it is. When you look at the world with knowledge, you realize that things are unchangeable and at the same time are constantly being transformed."
23330,"When silence is prolonged over a certain period of time, it takes on new meaning."
23331,"For an artist to do creative work, he needs at once physical health and some physiomental ill health. He needs both serenity and gloom."
23332,The special quality of hell is to see everything clearly down to the last detail.
23333,Human life is limited but I would like to live forever.
23334,"a samurai is a total human being, whereas a man who is completely absorbed in his technical skill has degenerated into a ‘function’, one cog in a machine."
23335,For clearly it is impossible to touch eternity with one hand and life with the other.
23336,I had no taste for defeat - much less victory - without a fight.
23337,Anything can become excusable when seen from the standpoint of the result
23338,"Yet how strange a thing is the beauty of music! The brief beauty that the player brings into being transforms a given period of time into pure continuance; it is certain never to be repeated; like the existence of dayflies and other such short-lived creatures, beauty is a perfect abstraction and creation of life itself. Nothing is so similar to life as music."
23339,"Better to be caught in sudden, complete catastrophe than to be gnawed by the cancer of imagination."
23340,"Quite possibly, what I call happiness may coincide with what others call the moment of imminent danger"
23341,"To see human beings in agony, to see them covered in blood and to hear their death groans, makes people humble. It makes their spirits delicate, bright, peaceful. It's never at such times that we become cruel or bloodthirsty. No, it's on a beautiful spring afternoon like this that people suddenly become cruel. It's at a moment like this, don't you think, while one's vaguely watching the sun as it peeps through the leaves of the trees above a well-mown lawn? Every possible nightmare in the world, every possible nightmare in history, has come into being like this."

23345,"Remember that consciousness is power. Consciousness is education and knowledge. Consciousness is becoming aware. It is the perfect vehicle for students. Consciousness-raising is pertinent for power, and be sure that power will not be abusively used, but used for building trust and goodwill domestically and internationally. Tomorrow's world is yours to build."
23346,"So, transform yourself first… Because you are young and have dreams and want to do something meaningful, that in itself, makes you our future and our hope. Keep expanding your horizon, decolonize your mind, and cross borders."
23347,"The United States of America is a nation where people are not united because of those three glaring frailties: racism, injustices and inequities."
23348,Remember that consciousness is power. Tomorrow's world is yours to build.
23349,Our ultimate objective in learning about anything is to try to create and develop a more just society.
23350,"First and foremost, you do not have to live up to or emulate the lives of any of your predecessors. But at the very least, you should know about them. You will have your own life, interests, and ideas of what you want or do not want in life. Do what you enjoy doing. Be honest with yourself and others. Don't think of satisfying anyone: your elders, peers, government, religion, or children who will come after you. Develop meaningful ideals, and become conscious of others, their existence, and their lives."
23351,Don't become too narrow. Live fully. Meet all kinds of people. You'll learn something from everyone. Follow what you feel in your heart.
23352,"The movement is contagious, and the people in it are the ones who pass on the spirit."

23360,When you feel good in a clothing anything can happen. A good clothing is a passport for happiness.
23361,The most beautiful makeup of a woman is passion. But cosmetics are easier to buy.
23362,I prefer to shock rather than to bore through repetition.
23363,"The most beautiful clothes that can dress a woman are the arms of the man she loves. But for those who haven't had the fortune of finding this happiness, I am there."
23364,Over the years I have learned that what is important in a dress is the woman who is wearing it.
23365,"I love black because it affirms, designs and styles. A woman in a black dress is a pencil stroke."
23366,"Fashions fade, style is eternal."
23367,"Chanel freed women, and I empowered them."
23368,What is wonderful about my art is that dream and reality can become one. There is just one step between the two.

23372,Fashion is like a party. Getting dressed is preparing to play a role.
23373,"Le plus beau vêtement qui puisse habiller une femme, ce sont les bras de l'homme qu'elle aime. Mais, pour celles qui n'ont pas eu la chance de trouver ce bonheur, je suis là."
23374,A woman's wardrobe shouldn't change every six months. You should be able to use the pieces you already own and add to them. Because they are like timeless classics.
23375,Dressing is a way of life.
23376,We must never confuse elegance with snobbery.
23377,"Fashions pass quickly, and nothing is more pathetic than those puppets of fashion outrageously made up one day, pale the next, pleated or ironed stiff, libertine or ascetic. Playing with fashion is an art. The first rule is don't burn your wings."
23378,Isn't elegance forgetting what one is wearing?
23379,"Decadence attracts me. It suggests a new world, and, for me, society's struggle between life and death is absolutely beautiful."
23380,"I always believed that style was more important than fashion. They are rare, those who imposed their style while fashion makers are so numerous."
23381,"I am no longer concerned with sensation and innovation, but with the perfection of my style."
23382,
23383,The hardest thing in the world is to simplify your life; it’s so easy to make it complex.
23384,
23385,"Who are businesses really responsible to? Their customers? Shareholders? Employees? We would argue that it’s none of the above. Fundamentally, businesses are responsible to their resource base. Without a healthy environment there are no shareholders, no employees, no customers and no business."
23386,"The whole purpose of an adventure is to gain some spiritual or emotional insight. When you compromise the process, you compromise the gain."
23387,It's not an adventure until something goes wrong.

23393,"There's a movement for simplifying your life: purchase less stuff, own a few things that are very high quality that last a long time, and that are multifunctional."
23394,Surfing and climbing are both useless sports. You get to be conquistadors of the useless. You climb to the summit and there is nothing there. And you could hike to the top from another direction. How you get there is the important part. It's the same with surfing.
23395,"Going back to a simpler life based on living by sufficiency rather than excess is not a step backward. Rather, returning to a simpler way allows us to regain our dignity, puts us in touch with the land, and makes us value human contact again."

23400,Fear of the unknown is the greatest fear of all.
23401,"Doing risk sports had taught me another important lesson: never exceed your limits. You push the envelope and you live for those moments when you’re right on the edge, but you don’t go over. You have to be true to yourself; you have to know your strengths and limitations and live within your means. The same is true for a business. The sooner a company tries to be what it is not, the sooner it tries to ‘have it all,’ the sooner it will die."
23402,"Hiring people with diverse backgrounds brings in a flexibility of thought and openness to new ways of doing things, as opposed to hiring clones from business schools who have been taught a codified way of doing business."
23403,"There is a beginning and end to all life - and to all human endeavors. Species evolve and die off. Empires rise, then break apart. Businesses grow, then fold. There are no exceptions. I'm OK with all that. Yet it pains me to bear witness to the sixth great extinction, where we humans are directly responsible for the extirpation of so many wonderful creatures and invaluable indigenous cultures. It saddens me to observe the plight of our own species; we appear to be incapable of solving our problems."
23404,"Everything we personally own that’s made, sold, shipped, stored, cleaned, and ultimately thrown away does some environmental harm every step of the way, harm that we’re either directly responsible for or is done on our behalf."
23405,The solution may be for a lot of the world's problems is to turn around and take a forward step. You can't just keep trying to make a flawed system work.
23406,I think risk is important. I don't care if it's a great financial risk or a physical risk. You only get out of something what you put into it and the fact that you are willing to risk something means that you are going to get a lot more out of it.
23407,

23414,"Four years ago on this very day I tried to take my own life. And I said, ""Zach, do it in front of your co-workers and end the misery.""

23421,I think those neighborhood signs that say 'slow children playing' are mean.

23423,When you look like I do its hard to get a table for one at Chucky Cheese.
23424,I like to read the bible in public places where people are watching me read it. And I like to mumur out to myself: 'Bullshit!'

23432,
23433,The only thing you live to regret are the risks you didn't take

23438,Time is how you spend your love.
23439,Don't live in a way that makes you feel dead.
23440,Don’t romanticise your ‘vocation’. You can either write good sentences or you can’t. There is no ‘writer’s lifestyle’. All that matters is what you leave on the page.
23441,Most of the cruelty in the world is just misplaced energy.
23442,The end is simply the beginning of an even longer story.
23443,It's gotten to a point where everybody is concerned about their rights and nobody is concerned about their duties.
23444,"Protect the time and space in which you write. Keep everybody away from it, even the people who are most important to you."
23445,The secret to editing your work is simple: you need to become its reader instead of its writer.
23446,"Generally, women can't do this, but men retain the ancient ability to leave a family and a past. They just unhook themselves, like removing a fake beard, and skulk discreetly back into society, changed men. Unrecognizable."
23447,"But it makes an immigrant laugh to hear the fears of the nationalist, scared of infection, penetration, miscegenation, when this is small fry, peanuts, compared to what the immigrant fears - dissolution, disappearance."
23448,You are never stronger...than when you land on the other side of despair.
23449,"The world is now multicultural the same way the world is round. It's not a selling point, it's not a 'quirky' feature, it's not a cynical marketing ploy, it's not an artistic statement, it's not even a plot device. It's a fact, like seedless grapes."
23450,Don't confuse honours with achievement.
23451,"It wasn't like the spare rooms of immigrants - packed to the rafters with all that they have ever possessed, no matter how defective or damaged, mountains of odds and ends - the stand testament to the fact that they have things now, where before they had nothing."
23452,Surely there is something to be said for drawing a circle around our attention and remaining within that circle. But how large should this circle be?

23454,"Your mid-thirties is a good time because you know a fair amount, you have some self-control."

23457,"Women often have a great need to portray themselves as sympathetic and pleasing, but we're also dark people with dark thoughts."
23458,People don't settle for people. They resolve to be with them. It takes faith. You draw a circle in the sand and agree to stand in it and believe in it.
23459,
23460,"The pig is the most shameless animal on the face of the earth. It is the only animal that invites its friends to have sex with its mate. In America, most people consume pork. Many times after dance parties, they have swapping of wives; many say 'you sleep with my wife and I will sleep with your wife.' If you eat pigs then you behave like pigs."
23461,"If he is terrorising the terrorists, if he is terrorising America the terrorist [...] I am with him. Every Muslim should be a terrorist."
23462,"As far as the matters of religion are concerned we know for sure that only Islam is the true religion in the eyes of God. In 3:85 it is mentioned that God will never accept any religion other than Islam. As far as the building of churches or temples is concerned, how can we allow this when their religion is wrong? And when worship is also wrong? Thus we will surely not allow such wrong things in our country."

23493,"At the end of the day faith is a funny thing. It turns up when you don't really expect it. Its like one day you realize that the fairy tale may be slightly different than you dreamed.

See once in a while, once in a blue moon, people will surprise you , and once in a while people may even take your breath away."

She flirted because it was fun to flirt and wore a one-piece bathing suit because she had a good figure she was conscious that the things she did were the things she had always wanted to do. Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim and most of all to heart."

23564,I wish I could write a beautiful book to break those hearts that are soon to cease to exist: a book of faith and small neat worlds and of people who live by the philosophies of popular songs.

23623,"Judaism, Christianity, Islam, all of these are branches, the root is love and that's where I went.

23643,Sometimes words are harder than blows.
23644,Everything I have achieved in football is due to playing football in the streets with my friends
23645,"I reached this level by sheer dint of hard work, toiling away at scores of tricks and experiments. I used to play with the ball from dawn till dusk and just kept practising. If I wasn't playing matches, it was trying out one on one or two against two with a tennis ball. Then I used to try aiming at certain targets. That's the only way to learn. And if I missed the target, I kept trying until I scored"

23647,"I have a need to play intensely every day, to fight every match hard."
23648,"It's true, pressure is something that goes with football nowadays. You need to accept it, and everything that it involves - the good and the bad."

23659,I am supposed to set an example to young players.

23666,There is no great; there is no small; in the mind that causeth all
23667,I fear no man. Sometimes I think I do not even fear God.
23668,"A wee child toddling in a wonder world, I prefer to their dogma my excursions into the natural gardens where the voice of the Great Spirit is heard in the twittering of birds, the rippling of mighty waters, and the sweet breathing of flowers. If this is Paganism, then at present, at least, I am a Pagan."
23669,
23670,The race belongs not only to the swift and strong but to those who keep on running
23671,Either you have your dreams or you live your dreams.
23672,Either you have dreams or you live your dreams.  I'm not all that remarkable.  I just keep putting one foot in front of the other until I get to where I have to go.
23673,"I believe people run marathons every day of their lives in one way or another, and we need to remember to give ourselves the finishers' medals we deserve."
23674,
23675,"Be confident, and just do it. It's all about not questioning what everyone else is thinking, since they're probably looking to others to know what is or isn't cool."
23676,"Im a total weirdo and have often felt like an outcast and a freak, and I love that. It makes things so much more exciting."

23682,Artists also have the responsibility of reflecting the truth.
23683,"Fashion is fun, and fashion is a form of art and self-expression. And I think it should have a wink-wink nature to it. For me, it's about the way it makes you feel. If you want to feel sexy, you want to feel bright, you want to feel good. That's what people are attracted to - when they see you execute an emotion or an idea clearly and proudly."
23684,I see the human in everyone and everything. No one is more important than anyone else; I still hang out with my high school friends.
23685,"I think it [my first heartbreak] probably just taught me that you will always heal. That this too shall pass. The first time you feel that sort of pain, you think it's never going to go away. Once you do survive it, you realize you can survive anything."
23686,"Black women have kinky hair, and we think we have limitations on what we can do. It's interesting that people think, 'Oh this is the only thing they can do.' But if you have blonde, straight hair and don't change it for 20 years - nobody thinks about it. Nobody says anything!"
23687,"You have to take care of your body, you have to rest, drink water, try to eat well, and then on top of that, you use makeup to highlight your beauty that comes from your health."
23688,"Television's getting better because people are investing more money and time and respect into it. But the secret weapon of television is that, because it's a slow burn, you get to meditate on things and develop them. As opposed to film, where you have an allotted amount of time and hopefully you can wrap it up in there."
23689,When you're making an independent film and you care about it so much you do all the prep work beforehand.
23690,"That's my approach to makeup in general, highlight something, what you love about yourself, but don't cover anything up, or distract from what you actually look like."
23691,I think it's important to represent black women and our natural hair. Not wearing a weave is totally beautiful and acceptable.
23692,I think less is more in terms of makeup in general.
23693,"When you look cakey, or you have too much on, and you actually see the makeup, the makeup isn't doing its job. When you use the makeup in a way where the people aren't thinking about the makeup, and they're looking at you, that's what we want."
23694,"So, absolutely, [my Dad] will call and say, ""I just got offered this or that and what do you think?"" My Mom [Lisa Bonet] will do the same. And we all trust each other's opinions. And we all know each other so well and what we're capable of so, if someone's scared to do something, we encourage them to take that chance because we believe in each other as a family."
23695,"The kinds of things I like with crystals are the really beautiful costume jewelry, vintage pieces, and they usually have that diamond shape."
23696,"It kind of varies. I don’t have a method yet. It depends on the script and the character I think I need. I’ve worked with acting coaches, researched roles, and channeled different parts of myself. It’s on a case-by-case for me, right now."
23697,"I don’t know what the secret is. We’re a family… We all love each other… and we’ve all worked through whatever issues there’ve ever been, and in a healthy way. So, we all get along. Love conquers all, I guess."
23698,I'm pretty much a thrift shop gal. Flea markets on Sundays.
23699,

23701,"It's ok to say, 'this is what I want' and go after it."
23702,"Sometimes we have to be patient because the one thing that is inevitable in life is evolution. Whether it comes at the pace that we are expecting it or not, it’s inevitable."
23703,"People think of Latina women as being fiery and fierce, which is usually true. But I think the quality that so many Latinas possess is strength. I'm very proud to have Latin blood."

23705,"I want to be the best daughter, sister, friend and wife I can possibly be - because when I die, I am not going to be buried with my Oscar."
23706,"I have been in relationships where a man has disrespected me, and I don't need to be friends with that man anymore. I don't want to be the one going, 'I'm cool, because I'm friends with all my exes.' There's a reason why you're called an ex. I crossed you off my list. Moving on. You cross a line, you need to know that you're going to walk this earth knowing that there's an individual who has no respect for you."
23707,"Not to settle. If you're not happy with a person, leave. And wait until you find that one person who makes you feel good about yourself every single day and is not expecting you to change, but to grow."
23708,You have to be very committed and find happiness in the work that you do.
23709,"I'm very accepting with my age. It's like notches on your belt: experience, wisdom, and a different kind of beauty. There comes a day when you've become comfortable in your skin."
23710,It takes a lot of courage to face up to things you can't do because we feed ourselves so much denial.
23711,Happiness is nothing but temporary moments here and there - and I love those. But I would be bored out of my mind if I were happy all the time.
23712,"I always strive to keep a balance with my fears. I don't like to be ruled by them. At the same time, I don't like the idea of living my life totally free of any fears. I like having that moderation."
23713,You need one hundred percent commitment; you have to be willing to wake up every morning knowing you're going to [practice] eight hours straight.
23714,"I like to be around people who are very passionate. People that won't fight but that will be very over-protective and outspoken about their opinion, their point of view, their ideas."
23715,There's nobody on this earth who can tell you that what you're feeling is wrong. They can tell you it's different to what they're feeling.
23716,"I want to have more sex, travel more, drink more wine and love life."
23717,"I have an amazing mother who's a real tough cookie. She taught me not to get emotional about [sexism in Hollywood], just be really practical and objective. Later, in the privacy of my own home, maybe I'll bawl or break some dishes, but you just have to keep going. It's not about fighting, it's about educating."
23718,"As a woman, you spend so much time either cooking or getting ready to go somewhere. I like to have music when I'm doing either of these things."
23719,"Britney's a very beautiful human being. After I worked with her, I realized that there was a reason why she was the most popular pop artist over so many other pop artists at that time who were more talented, had better voices. And it was because of her heart, her soulShe had the most amazing energy and was always positive and a very discreet person. We were young, too, and got to make a movie about three friends on a road trip. It was so much fun!"
23720,"There comes a day when you've become comfortable in your skin. But God as my witness, I am going to try to do everything I can to keep this ass together for as long as I possibly can - without going against nature."
23721,Let's start creating better roles that accurately depict people we know so closely.
23722,"Music is a very big participant in everything I do, from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed."
23723,Every character has their reasons - even the characters who do dumb things.
23724,
23725,"Nothing is more powerful than allowing yourself to truly be affected by things. Whether it’s a song, a stranger, a mountain, a tea kettle, an article, a sentence, a footstep -feel it all. Look around you. All of this is for you. Take it and have gratitude. Give it and feel love."
23726,Don't allow the coldness and fear of others to tarnish your perfectly vulnerable beating heart.

23732,Everyone has the heartbreak that shapes them in a way that they could never go back to the innocence that they had before.
23733,"Writing music is really personal, and it's a really exciting thing to participate in because represents the full creative process: It feels like something is coming from nothing."
23734,"That is so personal, and it’s my pet peeve when people press you on it. And it’s always women who get asked! Is anybody saying that to George Clooney?"
23735,"Oh, me? I'm not 80% water. I'm 80% coffee, and a little bit of sass."
23736,I need a coffee to go with my coffee.
23737,You don't have to wear expensive clothes to look good.
23738,I’m just being myself. There is not an ounce of me that believes any of that crap that they say. We can’t be feminine and be feminists and be successful? I want to be a f-king feminist and wear a f-king Peter Pan collar. So f-king what?
23739,"What led me to be an actor is that I have a strange something in me that can drastically change the way I appear to the world. Growing up, I couldn't understand why people would always have different ideas of me - but because of that I became aware of how you can manipulate your own ability to change. And then I learned to make a career of it."
23740,I like having a schedule. I tend to be the type of person that thrives on something being regular.
23741,"Girls get competitive, as though there's only one spot in the world for everything _ but that's not true. We need to stick together and see there's more to life than pleasing men. It's important not to cut yourself off from female friendships. I think sometimes girls get scared of other girls, but you need each other."
23742,I just like music that sounds like music. Not like machines and computers and things that you design to make things sound slick and perfect.
23743,I think every year I become happier because I become more comfident and more comfortable in my own skin.
23744,"When I was 13, I wasn't the coolest kid in my class, and that inner dork is a wonderful thing to have."
23745,"I think my knowledge of music theory is rooted in jazz theory, and a lot of the writers of standards - Rodgers and Hart, and Gershwin."
23746,"The internet's like one big bathroom wall with a lot of people who anonymously can say really mean things. It's fine, I believe in freedom of speech and I think people should think what they want, but I don't care to hear it."
23747,"I like a lot of old films, I like a lot old music, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that I like the idea of knowing what happens before, so that I can understand it."
23748,"I'm not doing it to pander to people. I just always knew what I liked versus what I don't like. I never liked things with too many zippers or spikes and stuff. That weirds me out. I like things that are pretty. And I think it's great to be pretty. I like being feminine. I think it's good to be feminine. We don't need to look like men or dress like men or talk like men to be powerful. We can be powerful in our own way, our own feminine way."
23749,
23750,
23751,
23752,"I have the nerve to walk my own way, however hard, in my search for reality, rather than climb upon the rattling wagon of wishful illusions."
23753,Love makes your soul crawl out from its hiding place.
23754,
23755,"There's two things everybody got to find out for themselves: they got to find out about love, and they got to find out about living. Now, love is like the sea. It's a moving thing. And it's different on every shore. And living... well... There are years that ask questions and years that answer."
23756,"Such as I am, I am a precious gift."
23757,"If you haven't got it, you can't show it. If you have got it, you can't hide it."
23758,"I am not tragically colored. There is no great sorrow dammed up in my soul, nor lurking behind my eyes. I do not mind at all. I do not belong to the sobbing school of Negrohood who hold that nature somehow has given them a lowdown dirty deal and whose feelings are all hurt about it. Even in the helter-skelter skirmish that is my life, I have seen that the world is to the strong regardless of a little pigmentation more or less. No, I do not weep at the world—I am too busy sharpening my oyster knife."
23759,"Justice, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder."
23760,Learning without wisdom is a load of books on a donkey's back.
23761,All my skinfolk ain't kinfolk.
23762,"Once you wake up thought in a man, you can never put it to sleep again."
23763,"I will fight for my country, but I will not lie for her."
23764,Silence is all the genius a fool has.
23765,You got to go there to know there.
23766,"That is the way with people ... If they do you wrong, they invent a bad name for you, a good name for their acts and then destroy you in the name of virtue."
23767,truth is a letter from courage!
23768,"anytime you catch folks lying, they scared of something!"
23769,
23770,"Tell me, and then again show me, so I can know."
23771,"I do not pray. . . . I do not expect God to single me out and grant me advantages over my fellow men. . . . Prayer seems to me a cry of weakness, and an attempt to avoid, by trickery, the rules of the game as laid down. I do not choose to admit weakness. I accept the challenge of responsibility."
23772,Bitterness is the coward's revenge on the world for having been hurt.
23773,"If writers were too wise, perhaps no books would get written at all. It might be better to ask yourself 'Why?”'afterwards than before There is no agony like bearing an untold story inside you."
23774,
23775,"I always said marriage should be a fifty-fifty proposition. He should be at least fifty years old, and have at least fifty-million dollars."
23776,My husband said it was him or the cat. I miss him sometimes.
23777,I learned in school that money isn’t everything. It’s happiness that counts. So momma sent me to a different school.
23778,How many husbands have I had? You mean apart from my own?
23779,"Love should be an inspiration, not an obligation."
23780,Diamonds are a girl's best friend and dogs are a man's best friend. Now you know which sex has more sense.
23781,To have twenty lovers in one year is easy. To have one lover for twenty years is difficult.
23782,The only place men want depth in a woman is in her décolletage.
23783,Being jealous of a beautiful woman is not going to make you more beautiful.
23784,"A girl must marry for love, and keep on marrying until she finds it."
23785,I want a man who's kind and understanding. Is that too much to ask of a millionaire?
23786,I never hated a man enough to give him diamonds back.
23787,"What is really important for a woman, you know, even more than being beautiful or intelligent, is to be entertaining."
23788,I believe in large families: every woman should have at least three husbands.
23789,I call everyone 'Darling' because I can't remember their names.
23790,I love the intellectual type. They know everything and suspect nothing.
23791,"As a woman, you have to choose between your fanny or your face. I chose my face."
23792,There is nothing wrong with a woman welcoming all men's advances as long as they are in cash
23793,"I think breeds of dogs and breeds of men are quite a bit alike. If you think it’s insulting that I compare people with animals, well, if you knew how I love animals, you would understand that coming from me, this is a compliment."
23794,"I don't take gifts from perfect strangers — but then, nobody is perfect."
23795,A man in love is incomplete until he has married. Then he's finished.
23796,"Conrad Hilton was very generous in the divorce settlement. He gave me 5,000 Gideon Bibles."
23797,Getting divorced just because you don't love a man is almost as silly as getting married just because you do.
23798,"I know nothing about sex, because I was always married."
23799,
23800,"If things do not change, there will be nothing left to change. Either power must pass to the people or everything will perish."
23801,If the people wanted my head I would bow without demur. If I had lost the confidence or respect of the people I would not want to live. The tragedy of the drama is that the very opposite is true.
23802,I am guiding you to seek truth from the facts of the historical conditions of our society and to identify the problems. The correct solutions will come with the correct identification of the problems.
23803,"A dreaded society is not a civilized society. The most progressive and powerful society in the civilized sense, is a society which has recognized its ethos, and come to terms with the past and the present, with religion and science. With modernism and mysticism, with materialism and spirituality; a society free of tension, a society rich in culture. Such a society cannot come with hocus-pocus formulas and with fraud. It has to flow from the depth of a divine search."
23804,I'm not trying to minimize things; I'm trying to bring them back to reality.
23805,"Yes, there are circumstances where a bloody suppression is justifiable and justified."
23806,A regime which puts in a bunker the highest law in the land does not have the moral authority to say that nobody is above the law.
23807,"Every government, every country, has the right to exercise force when necessary."
23808,"For instance, in the name of unity. You can't build without destroying."
23809,Lets build a monument for the veto. Lets build a monument for impotence and incapacity.
23810,Pakistan was once called the most allied ally of the United States. We are now the most non-allied.
23811,"Mrs. [Indira] Gandhi can rightly boast of having won a war, but if she won it, she should first of all thank Yahya Khan and his gang of illiterate psychopaths."
23812,I tried to explain that there was a great difference between me and Mujib [Rahiman]: he was a secessionist and I wasn't.
23813,There's only one man really responsible for those events - Yahya Khan. Both he and his advisers were so drunk with power and corruption they'd even forgotten the honor of the army.
23814,Tikka Khan won't try to stick his nose in politics.
23815,"In March [1972] the unity of Pakistan depended on the suppression of the secessionists. But to carry it out with such brutality on the people instead of on those responsible wasn't necessary. That's not the way to convince poor people who've been told that with the Six Points there'll be no more hurricanes, no more floods, no more hunger. I spoke out against such methods more emphatically than anyone else, and when no one dared do so."
23816,"In April [1972], after that fine business in Dacca, Yahya Khan sent for me. He looked satisfied, sure of himself, by now convinced he had the situation in hand. He offered me a drink. ""Well, you politicians are really finished,"" he said. Then he said that not only Mujib but I too was considered an agitator, I too was preaching against the unity of Pakistan. ""I'm always under pressure to arrest you, Bhutto"" I got so angry I lost all control."
23817,"The sanction of force stands behind the medley of personal orders and regulations of Martial Law. The sanction of the people's consent stands behind the hierarchy of laws. In one situation, the population is regimented into acquiescence. In the other, the population voluntarily establishes a contract with Parliament."
23818,"To conclude, the tragedy of March 25 [1969] caught me by surprise. Yahya Khan fooled even me."
23819,"[Mujib Rahman] is mad, mad! And they're all mad, the press included, who repeat after him, ""Three million dead, three million dead!"" The Indians had let out the figure of one million. He came along and doubled it. Then tripled it. It's a characteristic of the man - he'd done the same for the hurricane."
23820,"I would not let myself be intimidated by Yahya Khan, his methods had led us to disaster."
23821,"Yahya Khan wasn't interested in the government of the country, he was interested in power for its own sake and nothing else."
23822,"Tear gas, rubber bullets, and I would have arrested all the leaders. Oh, only a disgusting drunkard like ex-President Yahya Khan could have sullied himself with an operation carried out so badly and bloodily."
23823,"The same goes for the refugees. Mrs.[Indira] Gandhi says ten million. It's obvious she started with that figure in order to legalize her offensive and invade East Pakistan. But when we invited the United Nations to check, the Indians were opposed. Why were they opposed? If the figure were exact, they shouldn't have been afraid of its being verified."
