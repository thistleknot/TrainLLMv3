Instruction:

Based on this paragraph when was the last time we sent them to space?

Context:

Tardigrades are the first known animal to survive after exposure to outer space. In September 2007, dehydrated tardigrades were taken into low Earth orbit on the FOTON-M3 mission carrying the BIOPAN astrobiology payload. For 10 days, groups of tardigrades, some of them previously dehydrated, some of them not, were exposed to the hard vacuum of outer space, or vacuum and solar UV radiation. Back on Earth, more than 68% of the subjects protected from solar UV radiation were reanimated within 30 minutes following rehydration, although subsequent mortality was high; many of these produced viable embryos. In contrast, hydrated samples exposed to the combined effect of vacuum and full solar UV radiation had significantly reduced survival, with only three subjects of Milnesium tardigradum surviving. Also, it was found that the space vacuum did not have a significant effect on egg-laying in either R. coronifer or M. tardigradum. However, M. tardigradum exposed to UV radiation had a lower egg laying rate. In May 2011, Italian scientists sent tardigrades on board the International Space Station along with extremophiles on STS-134, the final flight of Space Shuttle Endeavour. Their conclusion was that microgravity and cosmic radiation "did not significantly affect survival of tardigrades in flight, and stated that tardigrades represent a useful animal for space research." In November 2011, they were among the organisms to be sent by the U.S.-based Planetary Society on the Russian Fobos-Grunt mission's Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment to Phobos; however, the launch failed. In August 2019, scientists reported that a capsule containing tardigrades in a cryptobiotic state may have survived for a while on the Moon after the April 2019 crash landing of Beresheet, a failed Israeli lunar lander, but in May 2021 it was reported that they were unlikely to have survived the impact.

Answer:

The last record of us sending Tardigrades into space was in April 2019, which had an unfortunate ending after the lunar lander, the Beresheet, failed and crash-landed on the moon.

Why might the 2023 MLB season break the record for total runs scored in a single regular season?

Context:

Answer:

The 2023 MLB season might break the total runs scored record in a regular season due to three rule changes.. 

1. Base sizes going from 15 inches per side to 18 inches per side. The increase in base size promotes safer stealing conditions for runners allowing them to more easily avoid contact with fielders. Also, the larger base surface area will help runners from "over-sliding" on the base leading to an out.

2. Two disengagements per plate appearance. Pitchers are only allowed two forms of disengagement which will reduce the number of pickoff attempts and mound step offs. In the event of a third disengagement, the pitcher will be charged with a balk leading to a base advancement for any runner on base or a ball given to the batter.

3. Eliminating the shift. When the time a pitch is thrown, all four infielders must be on the infield dirt or grass with two on each side of second base. This new rule will increase batting averages, hits per game, and more doubles.

Write critical success factors for a proposal to a company called ABC for an Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) effort

Context:

Answer:

CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS 
The following factors will be critical to the successful integration of the ABC's Operational 
Support Systems:
Project Management – Strong project management and planning will ensure an 
organized and cohesive solution. Excellent communication, aggressive issue resolution 
management, and planning materials will ensure deadlines are met, objectives remain 
focused, and costs are managed. The variety of vendors, system and process owners 
involved in an EAI effort requires a significant coordination effort to ensure success.

Knowledge of Telecommunications Operational Business Practices – ABC
must employ the services of an experienced Telecommunications consulting company to 
ensure business needs are met during the OSS EAI effort. Understanding of ABC 
business needs in implementing this EAI project is critical in ensuring the appropriate 
implementation strategy and successful rollout of the integration.

Enterprise Application Integration Expertise – It is critical that the selected vendor 
have extensive experience in planning, designing, and developing integration 
approaches, architectures, and frameworks to integrate complex Telecommunication 
OSS systems.

Knowledge Transfer – In order to maintain a consistent level of operation and support, 
it is critical that ABC employees are imparted with the necessary knowledge to 
successfully transition into the primary roles that support their systems and future 
integration efforts. Documentation, personal attention, and other resources are vital to 
this knowledge transfer and critical to ABC’s ability to succeed as a growing service 
provider.

From this paragraph, find out who built the Panama Canal

Context:

The Panama Canal is an artificial 82 km (51 mi) waterway in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean and divides North and South America. The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a conduit for maritime trade. One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken, the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduces the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, enabling them to avoid the lengthy, hazardous Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan.

Colombia, France, and later the United States controlled the territory surrounding the canal during construction. France began work on the canal in 1881, but stopped because of lack of investors' confidence due to engineering problems and a high worker mortality rate. The United States took over the project on May 4, 1904, and opened the canal on August 15, 1914. The US continued to control the canal and surrounding Panama Canal Zone until the 1977 Torrijos–Carter Treaties provided for its handover to Panama. After a period of joint American–Panamanian control, the canal was taken over by the Panamanian government in 1999. It is now managed and operated by the government-owned Panama Canal Authority.

Canal locks at each end lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial lake 26 meters (85 ft) above sea level, created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal, and then lower the ships at the other end. The original locks are 33.5 meters (110 ft) wide. A third, wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016. The expanded waterway began commercial operation on June 26, 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, New Panamax ships.

Annual traffic has risen from about 1,000 ships in 1914, when the canal opened, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, for a total of 333.7 million Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) tons. By 2012, more than 815,000 vessels had passed through the canal. In 2017 it took ships an average of 11.38 hours to pass between the canal's two locks. The American Society of Civil Engineers has ranked the Panama Canal one of the seven wonders of the modern world.

Answer:

France began work on the Panama canal in 1881, but stopped because of lack of investors' confidence due to engineering problems and a high worker mortality rate. The United States took over the project on May 4, 1904, and opened the canal on August 15, 1914.

What parts are there in an academic dress? Extract them and place them in a numbered list.

Context:

Academic dress is a traditional form of clothing for academic settings, mainly tertiary (and sometimes secondary) education, worn mainly by those who have obtained a university degree (or similar), or hold a status that entitles them to assume them (e.g., undergraduate students at certain old universities). It is also known as academical dress, academicals, and, in the United States, as academic regalia.

Contemporarily, it is commonly seen only at graduation ceremonies, but formerly academic dress was, and to a lesser degree in many ancient universities still is, worn daily. Today, the ensembles are distinctive in some way to each institution, and generally consist of a gown (also known as a robe) with a separate hood, and usually a cap (generally either a square academic cap, a tam, or a bonnet). Academic dress is also worn by members of certain learned societies and institutions as official dress.

Answer:

1. Gown
2. Hood
3. Cap

What is the greenhouse effect?

Context:

Answer:

The greenhouse effect is the process by which the sun's energy gets trapped in a planet's atmosphere and heat's the planet's surface. The energy gets trapped due to the planet's atmosphere having a higher transparency to visible radiation from the sun than it does to infrared radiation that gets emitted after bouncing off of the planet's surface.

What are some ways to improve the value of your home?

Context:

Answer:

There are several things you do can to increase the value of your home. First, you can focus on what is known as "curb appeal", essentially making the outside and surrounding of your house attractive. Ensure that the landscaping is well maintained, fix any broken doors or windows, and painting the outside so that the house does not look dull. In the interior of your house, the best places to focus will be in your bathrooms and kitchen. Further, you can replace major appliances and components such as water heaters, furnaces, or the roof to increase the value. Another way to increase the value of your home is by making it bigger. Often, pricing for homes is done by looking at the area of the house, so by adding on new rooms or extra space, you can also increase the overall value of the house.

Can cats communicate?

Context:

Cats need to communicate with each other for bonding, and relating with each other; they need to collaborate, play, and share resources. When they communicate with people, they do so to get what they need or want, such as food, affection, or play.

Cats use a range of communication methods such as vocal, visual, tactile and olfactory. Cats mostly meow to communicate with people, rarely with other animals. As such, the cats' communication methods have been significantly affected by domestication. Up to 21 different cat vocalizations have been studied. It is now evident that domestic cats meow more than feral cats.

Answer:

Cat vocalizations have been categorized according to a range of characteristics. Originally suggested by Mildred Moelk, cat sounds are often divided into three main classes:

sounds produced with the mouth closed (murmurs – purring, trilling)
sounds produced when the mouth is first opened and then gradually closed (meowing, howling, yowling)
sounds produced with the mouth held tensely open in the same position (growls, snarls, hisses, spits, chattering, and chirping).
In 1944, Moelk published the first phonetic study of cat sounds. She listened very carefully to her own cats and organized their sounds into 16 phonetic patterns divided into three main categories. She also used a phonetic alphabet to transcribe or write down the different sounds. She claimed that cats had six different forms of meows to represent friendliness, confidence, dissatisfaction, anger, fear and pain. Moelk classified eight other sounds involved in mating and fighting by listening to the animals in her yard and on the street.

Brown et al. categorized vocal responses of cats according to the behavioral context: during separation of kittens from mother cats, during food deprivation, during pain, prior to or during threat or attack behavior, as in disputes over territory or food, during a painful or acutely stressful experience, as in routine prophylactic injections and during kitten deprivation. Less commonly recorded calls from mature cats included purring, conspecific greeting calls or murmurs, extended vocal dialogues between cats in separate cages, "frustration" calls during training or extinction of conditioned responses.

Miller classified vocalizations into five categories according to the sound produced: the purr, chirr, call, meow and growl/snarl/hiss.

Owens et al. categorized cat vocalizations based on their acoustic structures. There are three categories: tonal sounds, pulse sounds, and broadband sounds. Tonal sounds are further categorized into groups of harmonically structured sounds or regular tonal sounds. Pulse vocalizations are separated into pulse bursts and hybrid pulse bursts with tonal endings. Broadband sounds are separated into four groups: non-tonal broadband sounds, broadband sounds with tonal beginnings, broadband sounds with short tonal elements, and broadband sounds with long tonal endings.

What is a sedentary way of living?

Context:

Answer:

When we talk about sedentarism in a community, we're talking about a group of people who settle down in one place and build their economic, social, and cultural lives there. The change from being nomadic to staying in one place is what led to the first civilizations. When we say that someone has a sedentary lifestyle, we mean that they sit or lie down for a long time and don't move around much or at all.

Context:

Onigiri (お握り or 御握り), also known as omusubi (お結び), nigirimeshi (握り飯), or rice ball, is a Japanese food made from white rice formed into triangular or cylindrical shapes and often wrapped in nori. Traditionally, an onigiri is filled with pickled ume (umeboshi), salted salmon, katsuobushi, kombu, tarako, mentaiko, takanazuke (pickled takana, Japanese giant red mustard greens) or any other salty or sour ingredient as a natural preservative. Most Japanese convenience stores stock their onigiri with various fillings and flavors. There are even specialized shops which only sell onigiri to take out. Due to the popularity of this trend in Japan, onigiri has become a popular staple in Japanese restaurants worldwide.

Context:

The subledger, or subsidiary ledger, provides details behind entries in the general ledger used in accounting. The subledger shows detail for part of the accounting records such as property and equipment, prepaid expenses, etc. The detail would include such items as date the item was purchased or expense incurred, a description of the item, the original balance, and the net book value. The total of the subledger would match the line item amount on the general ledger. This corresponding line item in the general ledger is referred to as the controlling account. The subsidiary ledger balance is compared with its controlling account balance as part of the process of preparing a trial balance.

As part of an audit, a method of testing balances may include tracing individual acquisitions to the subsidiary ledger for amounts and descriptions. The objective of this test is to determine that the current-year acquisitions schedule agrees with related subledger amounts, and the total agrees with the general ledger.

Answer:

date the item was purchased, expense incurred, description of the item, original balance, net book value

My 12-year-old daughter asks me: "Why can't I have my own cellphone? Everyone else in my class have one. Without a cellphone, I cannot make friends with them, and I cannot join their conversations. I feel lonely and sad." How to properly respond to my daughter? Shall I give her a cellphone or not?

Context:

Answer:

Dear daughter, I truly understand your feeling, and I don't want to keep you feel bad at school. I'm willing to give you anything that I can reasonably afford that makes you happy. However, I have some concerns that giving you a cellphone might harm you instead of making you happier. Can you address my concerns and make me feel safe to give you the cellphone? Here are some of my concerns:
1. Using cellphone too much would harm your eye sight. Especially for teenagers, whose eyes are still growing, it's very easy to have near-sight pretty quickly.
2. Using cellphone too much would take too much of your time, and you would spend less time reading books, doing exercises, playing outside, talking to people, which harms your overall development. Adults like me already ready lots of books, did lots of exercises, and talked to a lot of people when I was a teenager, so I already developed those skills.
3. Using cellphone too much would make you feel hard to focus on one thing. The scattered information would stimulate your attention, and make you feel excited at superficial contents, and don't think deeply.
4. You might accidentally lost your cellphone, and you will feel sad about it. Teenagers usually are more likely to lost things than adults in general.

Write some points about Ministry of Public Health (Thailand) using given text as a reference

Context:

In Thailand before 1888 there were no permanent, public hospitals to provide care to sick people. Temporary hospitals were set up to care for patients during epidemics, then disbanded when the epidemic subsided. Under King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) a hospital was constructed and completed in 1888 and named "Siriraj Hospital" in commemoration of the king's young son, Prince Siriraj Kakudhabhand, who had died of dysentery. King Vajiravudh, King Chulalongkorn's successor, established Department of Health on 27 November 1918.

During the reign of King Rama VIII, the Ministry of Public Health was established on 10 March 1942 as a result of the enactment of the Ministries and Departments Reorganization Act (Amendment No. 3) of B.E. 2485. Later in 1966, the date 27 November was chosen as the commemoration day of the Ministry of Public Health's foundation.

Answer:

1. There were no permanent public hospitals in Thailand prior to 1888 to care for the ill.
2. When an epidemic broke out, temporary hospitals were established to provide medical care for patients.
3. A hospital was built and finished in 1888 under King Chulalongkorn (Ram V), and given the name "Siriraj Hospital" in honour of the king's little son, Prince Siriraj Kakudhabhand, who had passed away from dysentery.
4. On November 27, 1918, King Vajiravudh, who succeeded King Chulalongkorn, created the Department of Health.
5. On March 10, 1942, under King Rama VIII, the Ministries and Departments Reorganization Act (Amendment No. 3) of B.E. 2485 was passed, which led to the creation of the Ministry of Public Health.
6. Later in 1966, the establishment of the Ministry of Public Health was commemorated on November 27.

Given a reference text that describes the air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption, how long was the air travel over Europe disrupted for?

Context:

In response to concerns that volcanic ash ejected during the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland would damage aircraft engines, the controlled airspace of many European countries was closed to instrument flight rules traffic, resulting in what at the time was the largest air-traffic shut-down since World War II. The closures caused millions of passengers to be stranded not only in Europe, but across the world. With large parts of European airspace closed to air traffic, many more countries were affected as flights to, from, and over Europe were cancelled.

After an initial uninterrupted shutdown over much of northern Europe from 15 to 23 April, airspace was closed intermittently in different parts of Europe in the following weeks, as the path of the ash cloud was tracked. The ash cloud caused further disruptions to air travel operations in Scotland and Ireland on 4 and 5 May and in Spain, Portugal, northern Italy, Austria, and southern Germany on 9 May. Irish and UK airspace closed again on 16 May and reopened on 17 May.

The eruption occurred beneath glacial ice. The cold water from the melting ice chilled the lava quickly, causing it to fragment into very small particles of glass (silica) and ash, which were carried into the eruption plume. The extremely fine ash particles and the large volume of steam from the glacial meltwater sent an ash plume hazardous to aircraft rapidly high into the upper atmosphere. The presence and location of the plume depended upon the state of the eruption and the winds. The large amount of glacial meltwater flowing into the eruption vent made this eruption so explosive that it ejected its ash plume directly into the jet stream, which was unusually stable and south-easterly. The ash was then carried over Europe into some of the busiest airspace in the world.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated that the airline industry worldwide would lose €148 million (US$200 million, £130 million) a day during the disruption. IATA stated that the total loss for the airline industry was around US$1.7 billion (£1.1 billion, €1.3 billion). The Airport Operators Association (AOA) estimated that airports lost £80 million over the six-and-a-half days. Over 95,000 flights had been cancelled all across Europe during the six-day airspace ban, with later figures suggesting 107,000 flights cancelled during an 8-day period, accounting for 48% of total air traffic and roughly 10 million passengers.

Answer:

Initially there was an uninterrupted shutdown of the air travel from April 15 until April 23. There were intermittent disruptions in different parts of Europe in the following weeks until May 17. Overall, the air travel over Europe disrupted for 33 days between April 15 and May 17 2010.

How does Windows Fast Startup Work?

Context:

Answer:

Fast Startup is a Windows feature that allows you to boot your computer in a few seconds rather than a minute. Rather than going through the cold boot path, Fast Startup uses a minimal hiberfile to resume the system. When the feature is enabled, selecting “Shutdown” in the Windows UI doesn’t actually shutdown the system. Instead, it closes all user applications, logs the current user out, and then creates a hiberfile. Because this hiberfile only includes the kernel, device drivers and a subset of applications, it is small and can be reloaded quickly. 

Alternatively, the cold boot path requires loading the kernel and drivers from disk, initializing the kernel and drivers, and launching various user mode applications. This can be especially slow on computers that use spinning hard drives.

Context:

Federalism is a combined and compound mode of government that combines a general government (the central or "federal" government) with regional governments (provincial, state, cantonal, territorial, or other sub-unit governments) in a single political system, dividing the powers between the two. Federalism in the modern era was first adopted in the unions of states during the Old Swiss Confederacy.Federalism differs from confederalism, in which the general level of government is subordinate to the regional level, and from devolution within a unitary state, in which the regional level of government is subordinate to the general level. It represents the central form in the pathway of regional integration or separation, bounded on the less integrated side by confederalism and on the more integrated side by devolution within a unitary state.

<s> Instruction:

how is white rice made?

Context:

Answer:

White rice is produced from brown rice.  Around the outside of the brown rice is a bran layer which is removed, and then a germ is removed.  What is left behind is a starchy composition.  During this process most of the vitamins and minerals are removed.  This is why brown rice is usually preferred as a healthier alternative to white rice.  White rice is has no nutritional value because the nutrition has been stripped from it during the production process of making white rice.

<s> Instruction:

If I'm strong in the gym will I be good at rock climbing?

Context:

Answer:

The answer is a bit complicated. Being physically fit will benefit you in rock climbing, like it will in many other sports. Traits such as shoulder strength, core strength, and pulling strength are all required to be a successful rock climber.

The key element needed to become a great or even just good rock climber, however, is finger and wrist strength. So much of rock climbing revolves around your ability to hold on to very tiny or oddly shaped grips to keep you on the wall. Few other sports emphasize finger strength the way rock climbing does. Yet, like all other muscles in your body, finger strength is an element that can be developed over time.

With the right balance of both general athletics, body control, and finger strength you can become a great rock climber.

How did the American Foxhound originate?

Context:

The American Kennel Club does credit George Washington as the Father of the American Foxhound. Washington and his wife Martha were dog breeders in Mount Vernon, Virginia.  Washington is said to have had a strong love for dogs; that grew from his love of hunting for foxes. This love of dogs stems from watching the relationship between the dog and the fox it was hunting. Washington was an avid fox hunter. The birth of this breed can be credited to Washington, and his relationship with Marquis de Lafayette. Lafayette gifted a group of French Hound’s to Washington, from there around two years after, Washington acquired eight regular hounds from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and 2 “Slow Pace” hounds from England.  From these 3 breeds of dogs, from America, France and England, Washington then bred the American Foxhound. Washington had no desire to breed this dog for attention to legacy, but rather for personal gain – to hunt foxes with his own collection of specially bred hunting dogs. Washington bred the American Foxhound in hopes of breeding faster speed and tracking of foxes into the breed of hounds he already owned. 

Answer:

George Washington is credited by the American Kennel Club with originating this dog breed by crossing French and English hounds with other American hounds from Pennsylvania.  Washington bred the American Foxhound because he loved fox hunting and wanted his own specialty breed for that purpose.

Why 2 is greater than 3?

Context:

Answer:

This is a trick question. 2 is not greater than 3. As a matter of fact, 3 is greater than 2. That being said, you could potentially define a mathematical space in which 2 is greater than 3. However, in real life we refer to real number domain in which 3 is greater than 2.

I'm going on a hike and the weather is cold, how should I dress?

Context:

Answer:

When hiking, it is important to dress in layers. As you hike, your body will heat up, and you will want the flexibility to remove layers accordingly. They layers should consist of a base layer to wick away sweat, an insulating layer to help retain body heat, and an outer layer to shield from rain or wind. You should also consider weather like snow or rain as this may change what you need to bring.

How can a technical expert identify a business use case?

Context:

Answer:

Often enterprises need help when a business user and technical expert try to define a business use case.  A technical expert, in-house or vendor, considers it an engineering problem, while a business user needs it to have a business impact.  Multiple frameworks can help build consensus.  However, an ideal approach will go through these steps.
1. Identify a business outcome.  This is a very high-level outcome that is industry aligned and has no technical description.  An example from the healthcare industry is a 'better patient experience.'
2. List strategies defined by an organisation to deliver these outcomes.  To our example in step 1, one approach is reducing patient wait time when attending a hospital.'
3. Clarify the KPIs and measurements listed in these strategies.  In this example, it can be 'Max patient wait time of 20 mins'. 
4. List business capabilities that can deliver results towards these KPIs.  Here we can think of ways patients can register their details electronically on their own or hospital devices vs paper forms.  Each entry will initiate an automated process to assign the right staff and resources to address patient needs.
5. Build technical capabilities that will deliver above listed business capabilities.  An online form integrated with AI Bot service and workflow automation can reduce time and manual intervention.

These technical capabilities that deliver a business capability towards a business outcome should be considered a 'Business Use Case'.

From the passage provided, extract the cost of the Ryman Auditorium's most recent renovation and expansion.

Context:

In 2015, the Ryman underwent another US$14,000,000 (equivalent to $16,004,773 in 2021) renovation and expansion. Much of the 1994 expansion was gutted and remodeled. The original building received only minor touch-ups and remained in use throughout the construction. The renovation and expansion includes more lobby space, plus expanded restrooms, concessions, and a gift shop. A new quick-service restaurant was added, called "Cafe Lula" and named in memory of Lula C. Naff. (The cafe closed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and was not reopened.) New renovations in 2023 will include a new gift shop in the previous Café Lula location.  

Also added in the 2015 renovations was a 100-seat theater. Here a short holographic film is shown that serves as the first exhibit on the building's daily self-guided tours. Entitled The Soul Of Nashville, the film features an actress portraying Naff in presenting the history of the Ryman. It also features an original song performed by Darius Rucker, Sheryl Crow, Vince Gill, and the Fisk Jubilee Singers.

Known for its casino and tourism industry, Reno is the county seat and largest city of Washoe County and sits in the High Eastern Sierra foothills, in the Truckee River valley, on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada. The Reno metro area (along with the neighboring city Sparks) occupies a valley colloquially known as the Truckee Meadows which because of large-scale investments from Greater Seattle and San Francisco Bay Area companies such as Amazon, Tesla, Panasonic, Microsoft, Apple, and Google has become a new major technology center in the United States.

The city is named after Civil War Union Major General Jesse L. Reno, who was killed in action during the American Civil War at the Battle of South Mountain, on Fox's Gap.

Reno is part of the Reno–Sparks metropolitan area, the second-most populous metropolitan area in Nevada after the Las Vegas Valley. Known as Greater Reno, it includes Washoe, Storey, Lyon Counties, the independent city and state capital, Carson City, as well as parts of Placer and Nevada Counties in California. The city proper had a population of 264,165 at the 2020 census.

Explain gravity

Context:

Answer:

Gravity is a fundamental interaction which causes mutual attraction between all things with mass or energy. Gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental interactions namely the strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravity. However, it is the most significant interaction between objects at the macroscopic scale, and it determines the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even light. 
Gravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity that was proposed by Albert Einstein. The theory describes gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass, and causing masses to move along geodesic lines.
However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other, with magnitude proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

What techniques are used to male dried fruit?

Context:

Dried fruit is fruit from which the majority of the original water content has been removed either naturally, through sun drying, or through the use of specialized dryers or dehydrators. Dried fruit has a long tradition of use dating back to the fourth millennium BC in Mesopotamia, and is prized because of its sweet taste, nutritive value and long shelf life.
Today, dried fruit consumption is widespread. Nearly half of the dried fruits sold are raisins, followed by dates, prunes, figs, apricots, peaches, apples, and pears. These are referred to as "conventional" or "traditional" dried fruits: fruits that have been dried in the sun or in heated wind tunnel dryers. Many fruits such as cranberries, blueberries, cherries, strawberries, and mango are infused with a sweetener (e.g. sucrose syrup) prior to drying. Some products sold as dried fruit, like papaya, kiwifruit and pineapple, are most often candied fruit.
Dried fruits retain most of the nutritional value of fresh fruits. The specific nutrient content of the different dried fruits reflects their fresh counterpart and the processing method.

Answer:

Which record label created Vinyl

Context:

The LP (from "long playing" or "long play") is an analog sound storage medium, a phonograph record format characterized by: a speed of 33+1⁄3 rpm; a 12- or 10-inch (30- or 25-cm) diameter; use of the "microgroove" groove specification; and a vinyl (a copolymer of vinyl chloride acetate) composition disk. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it remained the standard format for record albums (during a period in popular music known as the album era) until its gradual replacement from the 1980s to the early 2000s, first by cassettes, then by compact discs, and finally by digital music distribution.

Vinyl was introduced by Columbia in 1948

Can you give me some details about the moroccan geography ?

Context:

Morocco has a coast by the Atlantic Ocean that reaches past the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea. It is bordered by Spain to the north (a water border through the Strait and land borders with three small Spanish-controlled exclaves, Ceuta, Melilla, and Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera), Algeria to the east, and Western Sahara to the south. Since Morocco controls most of Western Sahara, its de facto southern boundary is with Mauritania.

The internationally recognised borders of the country lie between latitudes 27° and 36°N, and longitudes 1° and 14°W. Adding Western Sahara, Morocco lies mostly between 21° and 36°N, and 1° and 17°W (the Ras Nouadhibou peninsula is slightly south of 21° and west of 17°).

The geography of Morocco spans from the Atlantic Ocean, to mountainous areas, to the Sahara desert. Morocco is a Northern African country, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, between Algeria and the annexed Western Sahara. It is one of only three nations (along with Spain and France) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.

A large part of Morocco is mountainous. The Atlas Mountains are located mainly in the centre and the south of the country. The Rif Mountains are located in the north of the country. Both ranges are mainly inhabited by the Berber people. At 446,550 km2 (172,414 sq mi), Morocco excluding Western Sahara is the fifty-seventh largest country in the world. Algeria borders Morocco to the east and southeast, though the border between the two countries has been closed since 1994.

Spanish territory in Northwest Africa neighbouring Morocco comprises five enclaves on the Mediterranean coast: Ceuta, Melilla, Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera, Peñón de Alhucemas, the Chafarinas islands, and the disputed islet Perejil. Off the Atlantic coast the Canary Islands belong to Spain, whereas Madeira to the north is Portuguese. To the north, Morocco is bordered by the Strait of Gibraltar, where international shipping has unimpeded transit passage between the Atlantic and Mediterranean.

The Rif mountains stretch over the region bordering the Mediterranean from the north-west to the north-east. The Atlas Mountains run down the backbone of the country, from the northeast to the southwest. Most of the southeast portion of the country is in the Sahara Desert and as such is generally sparsely populated and unproductive economically.

Answer:

Morocco has a coast by the Atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea. It's bordered by Spain, Algeria and Mauritania. The geography of Morocco spans from the Atlantic ocean , to mountainous areas to the Sahara desert. The Rif mountains are located in the North and The Atlas mountains are located mainly in the center and south of the country.

Why is the traffic so bad in Seattle Tuesday through Thursday?

Context:

Answer:

One possible explanations is that they are common commute days in a week. The traffic is bad in Seattle attributes to several factors: it's a major metropolitan city with almost 2 million people in the area; its geographic features that prevent building roads more extensively esp connecting segments/patches across lakes and rivers; big companies such as Boeing, Microsoft, Amazon have big footprints in Seattle and the locations of their offices spread the area can also force people to commute around in workdays.

What is a bank run?

Context:

Answer:

A bank run is a sudden and drastic event that occurs when all the depositors in a bank rush to withdraw their deposits at the same time or within a very short timeframe. As more depositors withdraw their money, the rest of the depositor's fears of a bank's insolvency increase, therefore driving more depositors to withdraw their money. The only thing that can stop a bank run is everyone stopping from withdrawing their money, however this is a good example of game theory since the benefits of stopping individual's withdrawals benefits the whole system but is against the individual's benefit while withdrawing the individual's money benefits the individual but affects the whole system. Banks typically don't have the entirety of their depositors' money available for withdrawal. During a bank run they have to increase their cash positions, sometimes selling assets at a loss, increasing the likelihood of the bank's collapse.

Given this paragraph about Twitch, during what year did twitch have more than 100 million viewers per month?

Context:

Twitch is an American video live streaming service that focuses on video game live streaming, including broadcasts of esports competitions, in addition to offering music broadcasts, creative content, and "in real life" streams. Twitch is operated by Twitch Interactive, a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. It was introduced in June 2011 as a spin-off of the general-interest streaming platform Justin.tv. Content on the site can be viewed either live or via video on demand. The games shown on Twitch's current homepage are listed according to audience preference and include genres such as real-time strategy games (RTS), fighting games, racing games, and first-person shooters.

The popularity of Twitch eclipsed that of its general-interest counterpart. In October 2013, the website had 45 million unique viewers, and by February 2014, it was considered the fourth-largest source of peak Internet traffic in the United States. At the same time, Justin.tv's parent company was re-branded as Twitch Interactive to represent the shift in focus – Justin.tv was shut down in August 2014. That month, the service was acquired by Amazon for US$970 million, which later led to the introduction of synergies with the company's subscription service Amazon Prime. Twitch acquired Curse LLC in 2016, an operator of online video gaming communities and introduced means to purchase games through links on streams along with a program allowing streamers to receive commissions on the sales of games that they play.

By 2015, Twitch had more than 100 million viewers per month. In 2017, Twitch remained the leading live streaming video service for video games in the US, and had an advantage over YouTube Gaming, which shut down its standalone app in May 2019. As of February 2020, it had 3 million broadcasters monthly and 15 million daily active users, with 1.4 million average concurrent users. As of May 2018, Twitch had over 27,000 partner channels.

Answer:

Twitch surpassed 100 million viewers per month in the year 2015.

Who is the greater footballer of all time?

Context:

Answer:

There is no universal consensus on who the greatest footballer of all time is. In the women's game, Marta of Brazil and Mia Hamm of the USA are considered to be two of the greatest footballers of all time. Both were forwards, and both were awarded the FIFA World Player of the Year multiple times - 6 in total for Marta, twice for Mia Hamm. In the men's game, Lionel Messi (Argentina & Barcelona) and Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal and Real Madrid) are considered two of the greatest players of all time during modern times. Before them, Pele of Brazil and Diego Maradona of Argentina were often considered two of the best players of all time.

How many awards did the film The Walrus and the Whistleblower win per this entry of information?

Context:

The Walrus and the Whistleblower is a 2020 Canadian documentary film directed by Nathalie Bibeau. The film profiles Phil Demers, a former employee of Marineland who attempted to blow the whistle on allegedly inhumane treatment of animals at the institution.

According to a film industry newsletter, the film was made "in association with the Documentary Channel, and CBC Docs". The Documentary Channel's announcement about the film stated that Demers had "appeared four times on the Joe Rogan show, has testified before the Canadian Senate, and is being sued for $1.5 million for plotting to steal Smooshi, the walrus".

The film premiered as part of the 2020 Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada it was not screened theatrically, but premiered as part of the festival's online streaming component and aired on CBC Television on May 28 as part of the network's special Hot Docs at Home series of films from the festival.

In June 2020, the film was named as the winner of 2020 Rogers Audience Award, alongside the films 9/11 Kids, There's No Place Like This Place, Anyplace, First We Eat and The Forbidden Reel, and as Overall Favourite at Hot Docs. The Audience Award allowed the film to be fast tracked in the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature category, "provided it meets all other criteria for eligibility". Northern Banner, a division of Raven Banner Entertainment, subsequently announced that it had acquired the rights to distribute the film in Canada, probably starting before year end. The US and international distribution rights went to Gravitas Ventures.

The film received a nomination for the Donald Brittain Award at the 9th Canadian Screen Awards in 2021.

Answer:

2.  the 2020 Rogers Audience Award, and the Donald Brittain Award in 2021.

Give me some things to think about when planning a party

Context:

Answer:

Hosting a party can be fun, but there is work involved. Here is a list of questions to consider to being planning your party:

1. What is your budget? Planning a party can cost money and you should first determine how much you're willing to spend on it.  
2. Where is your party? You should first decide on the location of your party. It could be at your home, in a pubic park, or in a rented space.  
3. Who is coming? Choose a number of guests that will fit the space comfortably. Once you have a number, make your guest list. It's good to ensure that your guests will mesh well with each other, but most importantly, choose a list of people that you'd like to host.
4. When is your party? It's good to choose a time that most of your guest will be able to make it. If your party is outdoor, you should consider the weather when choosing a date. 
5. What are you serving? Consider if you want alcohol at your party and how much food you will need. If your party is during a meal time, you should provide that meal for your guest.
6. Is there entertainment? You can provide entertainment like games or music at the party to keep your guests engaged. It can be as simple as playing music from your phone or as big as hiring a band. 
7. Are there decorations? You can choose to theme your party and decorate the venue! 
8. What logistics are needed? Don't forget things like parking and clean up when it comes to planning a party.

Once you have answers to these questions, you are ready to start planning your party!

Given this paragraph, in what part of England does the River Thames flow, and what is its length in kilometres?

Context:

The River Thames (/tɛmz/ (listen) TEMZ), known alternatively in parts as the River Isis, is a river that flows through southern England including London. At 215 miles (346 km), it is the longest river entirely in England and the second-longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. The river rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire and flows into the North Sea near Tilbury, Essex and Gravesend, Kent, via the Thames Estuary. From the west it flows through Oxford (where it is sometimes called the Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The Thames also drains the whole of Greater London.

Answer:

The River Thames flows through Southern England and it is 346 kilometres long.

<s> Instruction:

Using examples from the text give me a rundown of the causes of wet snow avalanches.

Context:

In contrast to powder snow avalanches, wet snow avalanches are a low velocity suspension of snow and water, with the flow confined to the track surface (McClung, first edition 1999, page 108). The low speed of travel is due to the friction between the sliding surface of the track and the water saturated flow. Despite the low speed of travel (≈10–40 km/h), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass and density. The body of the flow of a wet snow avalanche can plough through soft snow, and can scour boulders, earth, trees, and other vegetation; leaving exposed and often scored ground in the avalanche track. Wet snow avalanches can be initiated from either loose snow releases, or slab releases, and only occur in snowpacks that are water saturated and isothermally equilibrated to the melting point of water. The isothermal characteristic of wet snow avalanches has led to the secondary term of isothermal slides found in the literature (for example in Daffern, 1999, page 93). At temperate latitudes wet snow avalanches are frequently associated with climatic avalanche cycles at the end of the winter season, when there is significant daytime warming.

Answer:

Wet snow avalanches can be initiated from either loose snow releases, or slab releases, and only occur in snowpacks that are water saturated and isothermally equilibrated to the melting point of water.

Given this paragraph about battles during India Independence day, what was the date when India win the Independence

Context:

August 15, 1947

Answer:

Independence Day is celebrated annually on 15 August as a public holiday in India commemorating the nation's independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, the day when the provisions of the Indian Independence Act, which transferred legislative sovereignty to the Indian Constituent Assembly, came into effect. India retained King George VI as head of state until its transition to a republic, when the Constitution of India came into effect on 26 January 1950 (celebrated as Indian Republic Day) and replaced the dominion prefix, Dominion of India, with the enactment of the sovereign law Constitution of India. India attained independence following the independence movement noted for largely non-violent resistance and civil disobedience.

What are the Great Lakes?

Context:

The Great Lakes, also called the Great Lakes of North America, are a series of large interconnected freshwater lakes in the mid-east region of North America that connect to the Atlantic Ocean via the Saint Lawrence River. There are five lakes, which are Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario and are in general on or near the Canada–United States border. Hydrologically, lakes Michigan and Huron are a single body joined at the Straits of Mackinac. The Great Lakes Waterway enables modern travel and shipping by water among the lakes.

The Great Lakes are the largest group of freshwater lakes on Earth by total area and are second-largest by total volume, containing 21% of the world's surface fresh water by volume. The total surface is 94,250 square miles (244,106 km2), and the total volume (measured at the low water datum) is 5,439 cubic miles (22,671 km3), slightly less than the volume of Lake Baikal (5,666 cu mi or 23,615 km3, 22–23% of the world's surface fresh water). Because of their sea-like characteristics, such as rolling waves, sustained winds, strong currents, great depths, and distant horizons, the five Great Lakes have long been called inland seas. Depending on how it is measured, by surface area, either Lake Superior or Lake Michigan-Huron is the second-largest lake in the world and the largest freshwater lake. Lake Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country.

The Great Lakes began to form at the end of the Last Glacial Period around 14,000 years ago, as retreating ice sheets exposed the basins they had carved into the land, which then filled with meltwater. The lakes have been a major source for transportation, migration, trade, and fishing, serving as a habitat to many aquatic species in a region with much biodiversity. The surrounding region is called the Great Lakes region, which includes the Great Lakes Megalopolis.

Answer:

The Great Lakes are comprised of five lakes: Superior,  Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario.

Given this paragraph about the Northamptonshire County Cricket Club, can you list down some points that can be inferred about the County Championship?

Context:

Northamptonshire County Cricket Club is in Division Two of the County Championship; the team (also known as The Steelbacks) play their home games at the County Cricket Ground, Northampton. They finished as runners-up in the Championship on four occasions in the period before it split into two divisions.

In 2013 the club won the Friends Life t20, beating Surrey in the final. Appearing in their third final in four years, the Steelbacks beat Durham by four wickets at Edgbaston in 2016 to lift the Natwest t20 Blast trophy for the second time. The club also won the NatWest Trophy on two occasions, and the Benson & Hedges Cup once.

Answer:

Based on this paragraph, it seems like the Country Championship refers to some form of organized competition between cricket teams belonging to different counties. The Championship has been organized for at least four times given that the Northamptonshire County Cricket Club finished as runners-up in it for four times. It also seems like the Championship was split into two divisions at some point.

Who is LBJ?

Context:

Lyndon Baines Johnson (/ˈlɪndən ˈbeɪnz/; August 27, 1908 – January 22, 1973), often referred to by his initials LBJ, was an American politician who served as the 36th president of the United States from 1963 to 1969. He previously served as the 37th vice president from 1961 to 1963 under President John F. Kennedy, and was sworn in shortly after Kennedy's assassination. A Democrat from Texas, Johnson also served as a U.S. representative, U.S. Senator and the Senate's majority leader. He holds the distinction of being one of the few presidents who served in all elected offices at the federal level.

Answer:

Lyndon Baines Johnson (/ˈlɪndən ˈbeɪnz/; August 27, 1908 – January 22, 1973), often referred to by his initials LBJ, was an American politician who served as the 36th president of the United States from 1963 to 1969. He previously served as the 37th vice president from 1961 to 1963 under President John F. Kennedy, and was sworn in shortly after Kennedy's assassination. A Democrat from Texas, Johnson also served as a U.S. representative, U.S. Senator and the Senate's majority leader. He holds the distinction of being one of the few presidents who served in all elected offices at the federal level.

Born in a farmhouse in Stonewall, Texas, to a local political family, Johnson worked as a high school teacher and a congressional aide before winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1937. In 1948, he won the 1948 Senate election in Texas after a narrow and controversial victory in the Democratic Party's primary. He was appointed to the position of Senate Majority Whip in 1951. He became the Senate Democratic leader in 1953 and majority leader in 1954. In 1960 Johnson ran for the Democratic nomination for president. Ultimately, Senator Kennedy bested Johnson and his other rivals for the nomination, then surprised many by offering to make Johnson his vice presidential running mate. The Kennedy-Johnson ticket won in the 1960 presidential election. Vice President Johnson assumed the presidency on November 22, 1963, after President Kennedy was assassinated. The following year Johnson was elected to the presidency when he won in a landslide against Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, receiving 61.1% of the popular vote in the 1964 presidential election, the largest share won by any presidential candidate since the 1820 election.

Johnson's domestic policy was aimed at expanding civil rights, public broadcasting, access to healthcare, aid to education and the arts, urban and rural development, and public services. In 1964 Johnson coined the term the "Great Society" to describe these efforts. In addition, he sought to create better living conditions for low-income Americans by spearheading a campaign unofficially called the "War on Poverty". As part of these efforts, Johnson signed the Social Security Amendments of 1965, which resulted in the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. Johnson followed his predecessor's actions in bolstering NASA and made the Apollo Program a national priority. He enacted the Higher Education Act of 1965 which established federally insured student loans. Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 which laid the groundwork for U.S. immigration policy today. Johnson's opinion on the issue of civil rights put him at odds with other white, southern Democrats. His civil rights legacy was shaped by signing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. During his presidency, the American political landscape transformed significantly, as white southerners who were once staunch Democrats began moving to the Republican Party and black voters began moving to the Democratic Party. Because of his domestic agenda, Johnson's presidency marked the peak of modern liberalism in the United States.

Johnson's presidency took place during the Cold War, thus his foreign policy prioritized containment of communism. Prior to his presidency, the U.S. was already involved in the Vietnam War, supporting South Vietnam against the communist North. Following a naval skirmish in 1964 between the United States and North Vietnam, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted Johnson the power to launch a full-scale military intervention in South East Asia. The number of American military personnel in Vietnam increased dramatically, and casualties soared among U.S. soldiers and Vietnamese civilians. Johnson also expanded military operations in neighboring Laos to destroy North Vietnamese supply lines. In 1968, the communist Tet Offensive inflamed the anti-war movement, especially among draft-age students on university campuses, and public opinion turned against America's involvement in the war. In Europe, Johnson's administration continued to promote and foster Western European political and economic cooperation and integration as his predecessors had.

At home, Johnson faced further troubles with race riots in major cities and increasing crime rates. His political opponents seized the opportunity and raised demands for "law and order" policies. Johnson began his presidency with near-universal support, but his approval declined throughout his presidency as the public became frustrated with both the Vietnam War and domestic unrest. Johnson initially sought to run for re-election; however, following disappointing results in the New Hampshire primary he withdrew his candidacy. The war was a major election issue and the 1968 presidential election saw Republican candidate Richard Nixon defeat Johnson's vice president Hubert Humphrey. At the end of his presidency in 1969, Johnson returned to his Texas ranch, published his memoirs, and in other respects kept a low profile until he died of a heart attack in 1973.

Johnson is one of the most controversial presidents in American history. Public opinion and academic assessments of his legacy have fluctuated greatly ever since his death. Historians and scholars rank Johnson in the upper tier because of his accomplishments regarding domestic policy. His administration passed many major laws that made substantial changes in civil rights, health care, welfare, and education. Conversely, Johnson is strongly criticized for his foreign policy, namely escalating American involvement in the Vietnam War.

Extract the steps to resolve a given supervised machine learning problem from the following text

Context:

To solve a given problem of supervised learning, one has to perform the following steps:

Determine the type of training examples. Before doing anything else, the user should decide what kind of data is to be used as a training set. In the case of handwriting analysis, for example, this might be a single handwritten character, an entire handwritten word, an entire sentence of handwriting or perhaps a full paragraph of handwriting.
Gather a training set. The training set needs to be representative of the real-world use of the function. Thus, a set of input objects is gathered and corresponding outputs are also gathered, either from human experts or from measurements.
Determine the input feature representation of the learned function. The accuracy of the learned function depends strongly on how the input object is represented. Typically, the input object is transformed into a feature vector, which contains a number of features that are descriptive of the object. The number of features should not be too large, because of the curse of dimensionality; but should contain enough information to accurately predict the output.
Determine the structure of the learned function and corresponding learning algorithm. For example, the engineer may choose to use support-vector machines or decision trees.
Complete the design. Run the learning algorithm on the gathered training set. Some supervised learning algorithms require the user to determine certain control parameters. These parameters may be adjusted by optimizing performance on a subset (called a validation set) of the training set, or via cross-validation.
Evaluate the accuracy of the learned function. After parameter adjustment and learning, the performance of the resulting function should be measured on a test set that is separate from the training set.

Answer:

Use the following steps to solve a given problem of supervised learning:
1. Determine the type of training examples,
2. Gather a training set.
3. Determine the input feature representation of the learned function.
4. Determine the structure of the learned function and corresponding learning algorithm.
5. Run the learning algorithm on the gathered training set. 
6. Evaluate the accuracy of the learned function.

What happens when you meditate?

Context:

Answer:

The art of meditation has a long prolonged positive effect on human behaviour and thinking. The mind is equated to a jumping monkey that doesn't remain quiet. The restlessness that it builds can lead to health issues and sometimes uncontrollable behaviour.  In general, meditation is to calm the mind and becoming the spectator or observer of the thoughts that rise in your consciousness. 

Now, let's break it down further ...

It first starts with understanding of the 'self' which can be equated to mind in loose terms. Experiences happen to you in your waking state and the mind first starts labelling things. Negative experiences are profoundly deep rooted then positive ones. All these experiences gradually defines how you react to situations that shapes your individual personality. Do you know that there is a spectator within your mind more like a dual personality? it is the subject - object thing. The spectator within you is the observer of things and is often neutral.

Idea of meditation is to remain a spectator for long periods of time and let fewer and fewer thoughts arise into your conscious state. At the end it leaves you a with a sense of accomplishment because as a spectator you're waiting and this deliberate attempt makes the thought (referred as devil) disappear.

How did the Royal Navy Protect the British Task Force from Argentine air attacks during the Falklands War?

Context:

Answer:

The British managed to minimize their shipping losses through a combination of layered air defenses and signals intelligence. Type 42 destroyers and Sea Dart missiles provided adequate high-altitude air defense, forcing Argentine pilots to fly at very low altitudes to evade Royal Navy ship-based radar. Royal Navy submarines operating off the coast of Argentina could use electronic sensors in their periscopes to detect electronic signals from Argentine aircraft as they took off. These subs provided the fleet with enough advanced warning to launch Sea Harriers on interception missions. Consequently, an Argentine pilot needed to be ready to dogfight a Harrier, dodge surface-to-air missiles, and then pull off a low-level bombing run. All three of these tasks required a level of training that most Argentine pilots lacked. Argentina ran out of fighter jets before the British ran out of ships.

Context:

Muskets with interchangeable locks caught the attention of Thomas Jefferson through the efforts of Honoré Blanc when Jefferson was Ambassador to France in 1785. Jefferson tried to persuade Blanc to move to America, but was not successful, so he wrote to the American Secretary of War with the idea, and when he returned to the USA he worked to fund its development. President George Washington approved of the idea, and by 1798 a contract was issued to Eli Whitney for 12,000 muskets built under the new system.

Answer:

The following are names of US presidents in the paragraph above: Thomas Jefferson (or Jefferson), George Washington.

Can we move away from fossil fuels in the next decade  ?

Context:

Answer:

In short No, Fossil fuels will be part of our Energy portfolio for several decades. Despite the general consensus that fossil fuels are the largest contributor to climate change, it’s also challenging to find an alternative energy source that replaces this on a global scale. As emerging nations grow, their demand for affordable energy will maintain the need for fossil fuels.  However, while  renewable energies have been projected to replace fossil fuels as the main energy source by 2050, we will still need to invest in decarbonization technology to offset the impact of maintaining emissions from fossil fuels.

What is the trias politica?

Context:

Answer:

The trias politica is the typical separation of powers in a government - the legislative power, the executive power and the judiciary power. These powers should be independent of each other, with each performing a different function, keeping each other in check. The legislative power drafts laws and regulations that govern the society. The executive power ensures these laws and regulations are upheld in society, while the judiciary power checks the performance of the executive power in upholding those laws and regulations.

Why has pickleball become so popular?

Context:

Answer:

Pickleball has indeed become very popular.  Promoters of the game have been calling it the "fastest growing sport" for some time now.

There are a few reasons many people cite for why the sport is so popular:

- It is a quick game to learn.  The rules are pretty simple, and more importantly, the skill needed to hit functional shots in the game is not very difficult to learn.  Compare it to tennis, where it can take multiple lessons from a professional teacher just to get to a point where you can hit a few good shots.  With pickleball, almost anyone of any age or fitness level can pick up a paddle and be playing a game in just minutes.

- Pickleball culture has tended to be very inclusive.  Many pickleball groups make it a point to be very inclusive of all ages, races and backgrounds.  This often creates a sense of community for players, and makes them more likely to keep playing and invite friends along, thus growing the sport.

- It is a fun way to get in a decent workout.  While not as taxing as, say, tennis, pickleball can be a good workout.  Especially since unlike tennis there is very little downtime.  The pace of games is very quick and involves near constant movement.  The workout is not cardio-intensive, but still it is an easy way to have fun while staying active.

Please give me a short bulleted list of the key events that happened in Kobe Bryant’s early life in time order, from earliest to the latest.

Context:

Bryant was born on August 23, 1978, in Philadelphia, the youngest of three children and the only son of Pamela Cox Bryant and former NBA player Joe Bryant. He was also the maternal nephew of NBA player John "Chubby" Cox. His parents named him after the famous beef of Kobe, Japan, which they saw on a restaurant menu. His middle name, Bean, was derived from his father's nickname "Jellybean". Bryant's family was Catholic and he was brought up with this faith.

Bryant started playing basketball when he was three, and the Lakers were his favorite team when he was growing up. When Bryant was six, his father retired from the NBA and moved his family to Rieti in Italy to continue playing professional basketball.After two years, they moved first to Reggio Calabria, then to Pistoia and Reggio Emilia. Kobe became accustomed to his new lifestyle and learned to speak fluent Italian. He was especially fond of Reggio Emilia, which he considered a loving place and where some of his best childhood memories were made.  Bryant began to play basketball seriously while living in Reggio Emilia. Bryant's grandfather would mail him videos of NBA games for Bryant to study. Another source of inspiration was animated European films about sports, from which he learned more about basketball. From 1987 to 1989, his father played for Olimpia Basket Pistoia where he paired with former Detroit Pistons Leon Douglas. Kobe would work at the games as a ball and mop boy and would practice shooting at halftime, with Douglas sharing, "At every one of our games at halftime, it was the Kobe show. He'd get out there and get his shot up. We'd come out of the locker room at halftime and have to chase him off the court".

Bryant also learned to play soccer, and his favorite soccer team was A.C. Milan. During summers, Bryant would come back to the United States to play in a basketball summer league. When Bryant was 13, he and his family moved back to Philadelphia, where he enrolled in eighth grade at Bala Cynwyd Middle School.

Answer:

- In August 1978, Kobe Bryant was born in Philadelphia. The name Kobe comes from the famous Japanese beef, Kobe.
- When Kobe was three years old, he started playing basketball.
- When Kobe was six, he moved to Italy with his family as his father started to play professional basketball there. 
- Two years later, Kobe moved to Reggio Calabria, and Pistoia and Reggio Emilia later.
- Kobe returned to the US when he was 13 with his family. He studied in Bala Cynwyd Middle School.

Why do Americans feel so strongly about gun control?

Context:

Answer:

The reason Americans feel so strongly about gun control is partly rooted in the history of the United States. Originally, colonial Americans mostly lived outside of towns, farming and hunting in the countryside. This meant that guns were not just for protection, they were for obtaining crucial food resources. The British threat to take away guns was more than a political imposition limiting resistance to British rule, it was potentially a life-threatening policy to families who depended on obtaining food via hunting. This background is in part why Americans originally had such a strong reaction to normalizing gun controls and access, which was codified as a right to bear arms in our Constitution. However, by contrast this aspect of the rationale against gun control largely does not exist today. Gun usage is for sport, and for protection, and only minimally to provide food on the table. However, because of this history, and constitutional codification, Americans feel justified in maintaining one of the world's most vigorous objections to any regulation or controls.

<s> Instruction:

From the paragraph provided, extract the mechanisms of heat transfer.

Context:

Heat transfer is a discipline of thermal engineering that concerns the generation, use, conversion, and exchange of thermal energy (heat) between physical systems. Heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms, such as thermal conduction, thermal convection, thermal radiation, and transfer of energy by phase changes. Engineers also consider the transfer of mass of differing chemical species (mass transfer in the form of advection), either cold or hot, to achieve heat transfer. While these mechanisms have distinct characteristics, they often occur simultaneously in the same system.

Answer:

The mechanisms of heat transfer include thermal conduction, thermal convection, thermal radiation, and transfer of energy by phase changes, although engineers also consider mass transfer in the form of advection a form of heat transfer.

Why do we say tip of the iceberg?

Context:

Answer:

Majority of Icebergs size/mass tends to be submerged under water. So, their size is misleading when seen from above surface. 
So the expression tip of the iceberg refers to a big issue when we see only a small part of it.

What are three mammals found within San Mateo County?

Context:

The county is home to several endangered species including the San Francisco garter snake and the San Bruno elfin butterfly, both of which are endemic to San Mateo County. The endangered Ridgway's Rail is also found on the shores of San Francisco Bay, in the cities of Belmont and San Mateo. The endangered wildflower Hickman's potentilla is found near the Pacific Ocean on the lower slopes of Montara Mountain. The endangered wildflowers White-rayed pentachaeta, Pentachaeta bellidiflora, San Mateo Woolly Sunflower, Eriophyllum latilobum, Marin Dwarf Flax, Hesperolinon congestum and the San Mateo Thornmint, Acanthomintha duttonii, are found in the vicinity of the Crystal Springs Reservoir.

In May 2014, a California condor was spotted near Pescadero, a coastal community south of San Francisco—it was the first California condor spotted in San Mateo County since 1904. The condor, tagged with the number "597", and also known as "Lupine", is one of 439 condors living in the wild or captivity in California, Baja California and Arizona. The three-year-old female flew more than 100 miles (160 km) north from Pinnacles National Park, in San Benito County, on May 30, and landed on a private, forested property near Pescadero, on the San Mateo County Coast, where it was photographed by a motion-activated wildlife camera. Harold Heath, Professor Emeritus, of Stanford University was responsible for the 1904 sighting, 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the University campus.

Pumas (Puma concolor), also known as cougars or mountain lions, roam the county.

Tule elk (Cervus canadensis nannodes) were native to San Mateo County and among the "favored foods" of the Ohlone people based on ethnohistoric and archeological evidence there. The discovery of two elk specimens made news in 1962, one a royal elk (royal elk bulls have six tines per antler) from a peat bog excavated in Pacifica's historic Laguna Alta, and now in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology collection. These may date from the time of Spanish settlement. Laguna Alta lay just south of the Interstate 280 and Skyline Boulevard intersection, east of Mussel Rock. The California Academy of Sciences also has an elk skull fragment collected one mile inland from the mouth of Purisima Creek in 1951. Additional coastal elk remains dating from the Middle and Late Periods in Northern California were found in at least five more late Holocene archeological sites in San Mateo County: SMA-115 (Montara State Beach site), SMA-118 (Bean Hollow State Beach site), SMA-244 (Butano Ridge site), SMA-97 (Año Nuevo Creek site) and SMA-218 (Año Nuevo State Reserve site). On the eastern side of the San Francisco Peninsula, elk remains were also unearthed at multiple archaeological sites along San Francisquito Creek.

Answer:

Pumas and tule elk are two mammal species found in San Mateo County.

Why do cats purr?

Context:

In domestic cats, many signals that occur when interacting with humans seem to originate from when the animal was dependent on the mother. Cats have been observed to purr for most of their lifespan, starting from when they were young and suckling from their mother. Purring may have developed as an evolutionary advantage as a signaling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and nursing kittens. Post-nursing cats often purr as a sign of contentment: when being petted, becoming relaxed, or eating. Some purring may be a signal to another animal that the purring cat does not pose a threat.

Answer:

Cats purr for a variety of reasons. Purring can be a sign of contentment or comfort, for example when being pet, while relaxing or eating. It is thought that purring may have developed as an evolutionary trait signaling reassurance between the mother cat and its nursing kittens.

What are some tools that every homeowner should have?

Context:

Answer:

There is a tool designed for almost every challenge a homeowner will face, but purchasing every tool could prove to be cost prohibitive, especially if they are highly specialized for tasks that may occur infrequently.  It's best to have a general set of tools that have a wide variety of uses, including a hammer, a set of screwdrivers both flat and philips, a tape measure, a level, a stud finder, and a utility knife. A battery powered drill and impact driver can also save time, and make mounting projects easier.

What is Cabernet Sauvignon?

Context:

Cabernet Sauvignon (French: [kabɛʁnɛ soviɲɔ̃]) is one of the world's most widely recognized red wine grape varieties. It is grown in nearly every major wine producing country among a diverse spectrum of climates from Australia and British Columbia, Canada to Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. Cabernet Sauvignon became internationally recognized through its prominence in Bordeaux wines, where it is often blended with Merlot and Cabernet Franc. From France and Spain, the grape spread across Europe and to the New World where it found new homes in places like California's Santa Cruz Mountains, Paso Robles, Napa Valley, New Zealand's Hawke's Bay, South Africa's Stellenbosch region, Australia's Margaret River, McLaren Vale and Coonawarra regions, and Chile's Maipo Valley and Colchagua. For most of the 20th century, it was the world's most widely planted premium red wine grape until it was surpassed by Merlot in the 1990s. However, by 2015, Cabernet Sauvignon had once again become the most widely planted wine grape, with a total of 341,000 hectares (3,410 km2) under vine worldwide

What are some signs and symptoms of Type 2 Diabetes?

Context:

Answer:

The classic symptoms of diabetes are frequent urination (polyuria), increased thirst (polydipsia), increased hunger (polyphagia), and weight loss. Other symptoms that are commonly present at diagnosis include a history of blurred vision, itchiness, peripheral neuropathy, recurrent vaginal infections, and fatigue. Other symptoms may include loss of taste. Many people, however, have no symptoms during the first few years and are diagnosed on routine testing. A small number of people with type 2 diabetes can develop a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (a condition of very high blood sugar associated with a decreased level of consciousness and low blood pressure).

Extract the places in the following paragraph. Give them as a numbered list.

Context:

In 1877 he enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania's medical school where he became interested in anatomy, and in 1882, he graduated with the Anomaly Prize from the Demonstrator of Morbid Anatomy. He did his residency at the Episcopal Hospital at Kensington, Pennsylvania. Gynecology wasn't practiced at the hospital, so he opened his own clinic in a two-story house in a working district where he also lived. He saw patients during the day and slept on a sofa at night with a string tied to his toe so that whenever there was a tug on the string, he would be woken up to provide medical assistance. He also made house calls. Later, with money from a group of Philadelphia philanthropist women, he was able to open a formal clinic with an operating room in Norris Square, which later became the Kensington Hospital for Women, the sixth women's hospital in the United States. There, he created the "Kelly stitch", a procedure to treat Stress incontinence, and performed the first successful C-section in Philadelphia. He gained a reputation as an innovator in surgical techniques during this time.

From 1886 to 1888, Kelly traveled to England, Scotland, and Germany to observe abdominal and pelvic surgeons at work. When he was in Leipzig in 1886, he was introduced to the palpation of female ureters by Max Saenger. In Berlin in 1888, he worked with pathologist Rudolf Virchow to determine the best way to catheterize ureters. Then, in Prague in 1888, Czech physician Parel Pawlik showed him how to catheterize ureters using a speculum and how to conduct an air cystoscopy. In 1888, he returned to the University of Pennsylvania, to become an associate professor of obstetrics under the recommendation of William Osler.

1. Kensington, Pennsylvania
2. Philadelphia
3. Norris Square
4. United States

How is Tesla's approach to full autonomy is different from the other companies?

Context:

Tesla's approach to achieve full autonomy is different from that of other companies. Whereas Waymo, Cruise, and other companies are relying on highly detailed (centimeter-scale) three-dimensional maps, lidar, and cameras, as well as radar and ultrasonic sensors in their autonomous vehicles, Tesla's approach is to use coarse-grained two-dimensional maps and cameras (no lidar) as well as radar and ultrasonic sensors. Tesla claims that although its approach is much more difficult, it will ultimately be more useful, because its vehicles will be able to self-drive without geofencing concerns. Tesla's self-driving software has been trained on over 20 billion miles driven by Tesla vehicles as of January 2021. Tesla also designed a self-driving computer chip that has been installed in its cars since March 2019.

Answer:

Tesla uses e coarse-grained two-dimensional maps and cameras (no lidar) as well as radar and ultrasonic sensors whereas its competitors rely on highly detailed  (centimeter-scale) three-dimensional maps, lidar, and cameras

<s> Instruction:

My family wants to buy a dog.  Which breed should we chose?

Context:

Answer:

Selecting a breed is an important step when deciding on a dog.  First, determine if it will be used for hunting, show or as a pet. Then decide if you would like a big, medium or small sized dog.  It's also good to know if you have any allegories towards particular types of hair of fur. Finally, since breeds can vary significantly by cost you will want to contact multiple breeders and rescue shelters to find the best fit for your needs at the budget you set.

What are some of the causes for the 1929 US stock market crash?

Context:

Answer:

The 1920’s were a booming time for Americans as the stock market was surging due to speculative investing.  Stock prices rose to records heights which drove the public to invest their liquid assets into securities.  Billions of dollars were drawn from banks for broker’s loans to carry margin accounts.  People were mortgaging their homes to pour money into stocks.  In late 1929, the market eventually overheated and prices began to fall despite efforts by the banks to buy up large blocks of stock to stem the losses.  Eventually, the panic was too much and the market crashed on Black Monday, October 24th when the market closed down 12.8 percent.  The sharp decline in the 1929 stock market eventually led to the Great Depression of the 1930’s.

<s> Instruction:

What do Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David have to say about Seinfeld being called "a show about nothing"?

Context:

The series was often described as "a show about nothing." However, in 2014, Seinfeld stated: "The pitch for the show, the real pitch, when Larry and I went to NBC in 1988, was we want to show how a comedian gets his material. The show about nothing was just a joke in an episode many years later, and Larry and I to this day are surprised that it caught on as a way that people describe the show, because to us it's the opposite of that." David similarly commented: "I like taking the worst qualities that a person has and trying to make something funny out of it. Doesn’t everybody do terrible things and have terrible thoughts? Just by trying to be as funny, you’re going to deal with a lot of things that are real, so the show’s really about something. The whole thing about the show being about nothing is ridiculous." Much of the show's humor is based upon repeated use of irony, incongruity and (oftentimes unfortunate) coincidences.

Answer:

Larry and Jerry are surprised that the "a show about nothing" phrase caught on as a way that people describe the show, and they are not fond of that description of the show.

Larry David commented, "...the show’s really about something. The whole thing about the show being about nothing is ridiculous". Larry states that the show is about "taking the worst qualities that a person has and trying to make something funny out of it". Jerry mentioned that the show was about "how a comedian gets his material".

What is the difference between Malayalam and Malayalaee?

Context:

Answer:

Malayalam is a Dravidian language spoken in the southern state of Kerala, India. it is closely related to Tamil though the origins of the language themselves are still disputed among scholars. Malayalaee (or Malayali), on the other hand, is a term used to denote a person originating from Kerala. The term Keralite is also often used as an alternative term to denote someone hailing from Kerala.

<s> Instruction:

Based on the given text give the name of the people and a summary of how they contributed to the notion of infinite or multiple worlds.

Context:

According to some, the idea of infinite worlds was first suggested by the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher Anaximander in the sixth century BCE. However, there is debate as to whether he believed in multiple worlds, and if he did, whether those worlds were co-existent or successive. The first to whom we can definitively attribute the concept of innumerable worlds are the Ancient Greek Atomists, beginning with Leucippus and Democritus in the 5th century BCE, followed by Epicurus (341-270 BCE) and Lucretius (1st century BCE). In the third century BCE, the philosopher Chrysippus suggested that the world eternally expired and regenerated, effectively suggesting the existence of multiple universes across time. The concept of multiple universes became more defined in the Middle Ages. The American philosopher and psychologist William James used the term "multiverse" in 1895, but in a different context. The concept first appeared in the modern scientific context in the course of the debate between Boltzmann and Zermelo in 1895. In Dublin in 1952, Erwin Schrödinger gave a lecture in which he jocularly warned his audience that what he was about to say might "seem lunatic". He said that when his equations seemed to describe several different histories, these were "not alternatives, but all really happen simultaneously". This sort of duality is called "superposition".

Answer:

Here are the name of the people and a summary of how they contributed to the notion of infinite or multiple worlds:

Anaximander (6th century BCE): The idea of infinite worlds was first suggested by him.

Leucippus (5th century BCE), Democritus (5th century BCE), Epicurus (341-270 BCE) and Lucretius (1st century BCE):  They believed in the concept of innumerable worlds.

Chrysippus (3rd century BCE): He suggested the existence of multiple universes across time which means the world eternally expired and regenerated.

William James (1895): He first used the term "multiverse". 

Boltzmann and Zermelo (1895): In a debate between them the multiverse concept first appeared in the modern scientific context.

Erwin Schrödinger (1952): He first came up with the term "superposition" by referring to his equations that seemed to describe several different histories which were "not alternatives, but all really happen simultaneously".

Is there a correlation between the milestones required between Data AI/ML and Intelligent Automation (RPA) value curve over time?

Context:

Answer:

For organizations to achieve the most value from their data, they must establish a data foundation that allows for high-quality reporting on past events. Establishing a Databrick’s Lakehouse foundation requires no AI/ML capabilities. Then, over time, use that data AI/ML to drive automated decisions for crucial business processes.  For this reason, there is a direct correlation between the “value curve” for both data and intelligent automation. 
The value maturity curve for intelligent automation starts with basic, attended, or unattended automation that mimics basic human processes today. Then, as you mature your Robotic Process Automation (RPA) program, your automation(s) need to expand to include simple document understanding AI.  Extracting data from the same form hundreds or thousands of times is a good example. Finally, for any organization to gain the highest value and ROI for their intelligent automation investments, using complex AI/ML to produce automated decisions for digital workers (unattended automation) enables exceptionally complex, long-running automation to be successfully developed, put into production, and maintained over time.

In summary, think of “AI/ML” as the thinking and “Intelligent Automation” as the doing. The value of both Data and RPA to any organization grows exponentially over time as they develop their ability to apply to complex AI/ML such that those models deliver trusted automated decisions to the digital workforce running complex automation.

How are sub-lets traditionally they handled?

Context:

Answer:

Many properties try to be as hands-off as possible when dealing with sub-lets and others go as far as to deter and make sub-letting as difficult as possible. No follow-up calls to replacement tenants, massive sub-let fees, and even trying to persuade replacement tenants to sign a new lease, with move-in specials. While all this may help your property in the short-run with maintaining and driving your current occupancy up; mishandling sub-lets can be detrimental to your property in the long run. Reputation and brand management are the most important factors in generating new leads and driving traffic to your property. Word-of-mouth reputation, online reviews, and social media platforms all suffer from the hands-off/no sub-letting mindset. No one wants to lease at an apartment that will try to keep him or her in their lease when they need to move back home to tend to a family emergency or transfer schools to better their education. Sub-lets will ALWAYS be a part of your property, regardless of how great your customer service may be.

<s> Instruction:

Given this text about Heracles' twelve labors, construct a list of characters that either help him in his quest, how, and why.

Context:

1. Slay the Nemean Lion
Heracles defeated a lion that was attacking the city of Nemea with his bare hands. After he succeeded he wore the skin as a cloak to demonstrate his power over the opponent he had defeated.
2. Slay the nine-headed Lernaean Hydra
A fire-breathing monster with multiple serpent heads. When one head was cut off, two would grow in its place. It lived in a swamp near Lerna. Hera had sent it in hope it would destroy Heracles' home city because she thought it was invincible. With help from his nephew Iolaus, he defeated the monster and dipped his arrows in its poisoned blood, thus envenomizing them.
3. Capture the Golden Hind of Artemis
Not to kill, but to catch, this hind that was sacred to Artemis. A different, but still difficult, task for a hero. It cost time but, having chased it for a year, Heracles wore out the Hind. Artemis intervened, but as soon as Heracles explained the situation to her, she allowed him to take it, and he presented it alive to Eurystheus.
4. Capture the Erymanthian Boar
A fearsome marauding boar on the loose. Eurystheus set Heracles the Labour of catching it, and bringing it to Mycenae. Again, a time-consuming task, but the tireless hero found the beast, captured it, and brought it to its final spot. Patience is the heroic quality in the third and fourth Labours.
5. Clean the Augean stables in a single day
The Augean stables were the home of 3,000 cattle with poisoned faeces which Augeas had been given by his father Helios. Heracles was given the near impossible task of cleaning the stables of the diseased faeces. He accomplished it by digging ditches on both sides of the stables, moving them into the ditches, and then diverting the rivers Alpheios and Pineios to wash the ditches clean.
6. Slay the Stymphalian Birds
These aggressive man-eating birds were terrorizing a forest near Lake Stymphalia in northern Arcadia. Heracles scared them with a rattle given to him by Athena, to frighten them into flight away from the forest, allowing him to shoot many of them with his bow and arrow and bring back this proof of his success to Eurystheus.
7. Capture the Cretan Bull
The harmful bull, father of the Minotaur, was laying waste to the lands round Knossos on Crete. It embodied the rage of Poseidon at having his gift (the Bull) to Minos diverted from the intention to sacrifice it to himself. Heracles captured it, and carried it on his shoulders to Eurystheus in Tiryns. Eurystheus released it, when it wandered to Marathon which it then terrorized, until killed by Theseus.
8. Steal the Mares of Diomedes
Stealing the horses from Diomedes' stables that had been trained by their owner to feed on human flesh was his next challenge. Heracles' task was to capture them and hand them over to Eurystheus. He accomplished this task by feeding King Diomedes to the animals before binding their mouths shut.
9. Obtain the girdle of Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons
Hippolyta was an Amazon queen and she had a girdle given to her by her father Ares. Heracles had to retrieve the girdle and return it to Eurystheus. He and his band of companions received a rough welcome because, ordered by Hera, the Amazons were supposed to attack them; however, against all odds, Heracles completed the task and secured the girdle for Eurystheus.
10. Obtain the cattle of the monster Geryon
The next challenge was to capture the herd guarded by a two-headed dog called Orthrus, which belonged to Geryon; a giant with three heads and six arms who lived in Erytheia. While travelling to Erytheia, he passed through the Libyan desert and was so annoyed by the heat he shot an arrow at Helios, the sun. Helios, impressed, lent him his giant cup which Heracles used to find Orthrus, the herdsman Erytion and the owner, Geryon. He killed the first two with his club and the third with a poisoned arrow. Heracles then herded the cattle and, with difficulty, took them to Eurystheus.
11. Steal the golden apples of the Hesperides
Hercules stealing the golden apples from the Garden of the Hesperides
These sacred fruits were protected by Hera who had set Ladon, a fearsome hundred-headed dragon as the guardian. Heracles had to first find where the garden was; he asked Nereus for help. He came across Prometheus on his journey. Heracles shot the eagle eating at his liver, and in return he helped Heracles with knowledge that his brother would know where the garden was. His brother Atlas offered him help with the apples if he would hold up the heavens while he was gone. Atlas tricked him and did not return. Heracles returned the trickery and managed to get Atlas taking the burden of the heavens once again, and returned the apples to Mycenae.
12. Capture and bring back Cerberus
His last labour and undoubtedly the riskiest. Eurystheus was so frustrated that Heracles was completing all the tasks that he had given him that he imposed one he believed to be impossible: Heracles had to go down into the underworld of Hades and capture the ferocious three-headed dog Cerberus who guarded the gates. He used the souls to help convince Hades to hand over the dog. He agreed to give him the dog if he used no weapons to obtain him. Heracles succeeded and took the creature back to Mycenae, causing Eurystheus to be fearful of the power and strength of this hero.

Answer:

- Iolaus, who helps him kill the Lernaean Hydra, since he is his nephew
- Artemis, who allows him to take the Golden Hind, after Heracles explains his situation
- Prometheus, who tells him that his brother Atlas knows the location of the garden of the Hesperides, in return for being saved by Heracles

Can AI systems fall in love?

Context:

Answer:

AI, unlike humans, has no emotions or feelings. It does, however, have the unique ability to perceive and analyze human sentiments from vast amounts of data on which it has been trained. It can even outperform humans when it comes to mimicking and reproducing these emotions in a more efficient and effective manner. While AI does not experience emotions in the same way that humans do, it is still capable of understanding and replicating them in a remarkable and unprecedented way.

From the passage provided, extract the shape of Milky way Galaxy

Context:

The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with a D25 isophotal diameter estimated at 26.8 ± 1.1 kiloparsecs (87,400 ± 3,590 light-years), but only about 1,000 light years thick at the spiral arms (more at the bulge). Recent simulations suggest that a dark matter area, also containing some visible stars, may extend up to a diameter of almost 2 million light-years (613 kpc). The Milky Way has several satellite galaxies and is part of the Local Group of galaxies, which form part of the Virgo Supercluster, which is itself a component of the Laniakea Supercluster.

Answer:

The shape of Milky way galaxy is barred spiral.

Who was the Apostle Paul?

Context:

Answer:

Apostle Paul, who was also known as Saint Paul, was a Christian Apostle who spread the teachings of Jesus Christ. According to the book of Acts in the bible, Paul was Pharisees and lead persecution of early disciples of Jesus. He encountered Jesus on the road to Damascus to find Christians there and bring them bound to Jerusalem. But on his way a light brighter than a sun shone around him and those with him from heaven at mid day. Then he fell to the ground and heard a voice, "Saul, saul, why are you persecuting me?". and he said "who are you?" then the lord said, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. It is hard for you to kick against the goads." Paul asked "What do you want me to do?" then the lord said "Arise and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do." Having been made blind, he was lead to the city and days later his sight was restored by Ananias of Damascus. Then Paul was baptized and immediately started to proclaim Christian message. He proclaimed mainly to the gentiles and he is also known as an Apostle to the gentiles.  He planted several churches in Galatia, Philippi, Thessalonika, Corinth and Ephesus.Thirteen or Fourteen of the twenty seven books in the new Testament was written by Paul through the guidance of the holy spirit.

<s> Instruction:

What is the oldest known civilization?

Context:

Scholars generally acknowledge six cradles of civilization. Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, Indus Valley, and Ancient China are believed to be the earliest in the Old World. Cradles of civilization in the New World are the Caral-Supe civilization of coastal Peru and the Olmec civilization of Mexico. All of the cradles of civilization depended upon agriculture for sustenance (except possibly Caral-Supe which may have depended initially on marine resources). All depended upon farmers producing an agricultural surplus to support the centralized government, political leaders, priests, and public works of the urban centers of the civilization.

Less formally, the term "cradle of civilization" is often used to refer to other historic ancient civilizations, such as Greece or Rome, which have both been called the "cradle of Western civilization".

Answer:

The oldest known human civilizations are known to exist in Mesopotamia (Modern day Iraq), Indus Valley (a region located in modern-day Pakistan), Ancient Egypt and Ancient China.

<s> Instruction:

Based on the following passage what are positive and conventional current?

Context:

The movement of electric charge is known as an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.
By historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.
The process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.
In engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.  If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.

Answer:

By historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current.

Tell me about Hong Kong

Context:

Hong Kong, officially the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China (abbr. Hong Kong SAR or HKSAR), is a city and special administrative region of China on the eastern Pearl River Delta in South China. With 7.5 million residents of various nationalities in a 1,104-square-kilometre (426 sq mi) territory, Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated places in the world. Hong Kong is also a major global financial centre and one of the most developed cities in the world.

Hong Kong was established as a colony of the British Empire after the Qing Empire ceded Hong Kong Island from Xin'an County at the end of the First Opium War in 1841 then again in 1842. The colony expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 after the Second Opium War and was further extended when Britain obtained a 99-year lease of the New Territories in 1898. British Hong Kong was occupied by Imperial Japan from 1941 to 1945 during World War II; British administration resumed after the surrender of Japan. The whole territory was transferred to China in 1997. As one of China's two special administrative regions (the other being Macau), Hong Kong maintains separate governing and economic systems from that of mainland China under the principle of "one country, two systems".

Originally a sparsely populated area of farming and fishing villages, the territory has become one of the world's most significant financial centres and commercial ports. As of 2021, it is the world's ninth-largest exporter and eight-largest importer. Hong Kong has a market economy characterised by a focus on services, low taxation and free trade; its currency, the Hong Kong dollar, is the eighth most traded currency in the world. Hong Kong is home to the third-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world, the second-highest number of billionaires of any city in Asia, and the largest concentration of ultra high-net-worth individuals of any city in the world. Although the city has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, severe income inequality exists among the population. Most notably, housing in Hong Kong has been well-documented to experience a chronic persistent shortage; the extremely compact house sizes and the extremely high housing density are the effects of Hong Kong's housing market being the most expensive housing in the world.

Hong Kong is a highly developed territory and has a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.952, ranking fourth in the world. The city has the largest number of skyscrapers of any city in the world, and its residents have some of the highest life expectancies in the world. The dense space has led to a highly developed transportation network with public transport rates exceeding 90%. Hong Kong is ranked 3rd in the Global Financial Centres Index.

Write a poem about lost friendship

Context:

Answer:

Thought we were sandstorms,
Getting rid of everything on our way.
Thought we were revolutionaries,
Changing the usual ways of society.
Thought we were inseparable,
Holding our hands firmly.
Thought we were makers of our future,
Closing our eyes at future.
Thought of the new ideas we would implement,
Being ignorant of life's ways.
But, now I know,
We were never destined to take the same path,
Never will we sit and chat as we once used to.

What is the best way to get your kid to become a better sleeper?

Context:

Answer:

Having a kid that is a good sleeper is oftentimes something that you can not fully control as each kid is going to be different. However, with the state of technology today, there are a number of tools and resources out there today that  attempt to help your kid become a better sleeper. Apparatuses like the snoo can simulate a parent rocking your kid to sleep without fully waking the child. The thing that matters most for most babies is establishing a routine. Starting at an early age, routines can be implemented that can help "condition" a kid that bedtime approaches. Following the same routine and time schedule established a sense of familiarity for the baby. Stick to this and your kid should become a much better sleeper.

How does a pine cone work?

Context:

The female cone has two types of scale: the bract scales, and the seed scales (or ovuliferous scales), one subtended by each bract scale, derived from a highly modified branchlet. On the upper-side base of each seed scale are two ovules that develop into seeds after fertilization by pollen grains. The bract scales develop first, and are conspicuous at the time of pollination; the seed scales develop later to enclose and protect the seeds, with the bract scales often not growing further. The scales open temporarily to receive pollen, then close during fertilization and maturation, and then re-open again at maturity to allow the seed to escape. Maturation takes 6–8 months from pollination in most Pinaceae genera, but 12 months in cedars and 18–24 months (rarely more) in most pines. The cones open either by the seed scales flexing back when they dry out, or (in firs, cedars and golden larch) by the cones disintegrating with the seed scales falling off. The cones are conic, cylindrical or ovoid (egg-shaped), and small to very large, from 2–60 cm long and 1–20 cm broad.

After ripening, the opening of non-serotinous pine cones is associated with their moisture content—cones are open when dry and closed when wet. This assures that the small, windborne seeds will be dispersed during relatively dry weather, and thus, the distance traveled from the parent tree will be enhanced. A pine cone will go through many cycles of opening and closing during its life span, even after seed dispersal is complete. This process occurs with older cones while attached to branches and even after the older cones have fallen to the forest floor. The condition of fallen pine cones is a crude indication of the forest floor's moisture content, which is an important indication of wildfire risk. Closed cones indicate damp conditions while open cones indicate the forest floor is dry.

Answer:

A pine cone consists of scales which protect seeds. The scales can open and close depending on conditions. The scales will open temporarily to receive pollen, then close again until the seeds mature. Once mature, the scales will open and close depending on their moisture content. Once the seeds are mature, the scales can open again to allow seeds to escape. When dry, the cones open allowing the small windborne seeds to disperse as widely as possible. This cycle of opening and closing continues until the seeds are dispersed.

Answer:

Ensure that when you walk her to use a prong collar. Ensure the collar is not loose on her neck, but high up and tight (cannot move easily) under her ear. This will make sure she doesn't take sudden movements and allow her to ensure that you will direct her whether the oncoming distraction is a threat.

Using the text below extract the sponsor, bid amount and the time period (from year to to year) in the format: {sponsor} - {bid amount} - {time period) and show it as a bullet list

Context:

From 2008 to 2012, the title sponsor was DLF, India's largest real estate developer, who had secured the rights with a bid of ₹200 crore (US$25 million) for five seasons. After the conclusion of the 2012 season, PepsiCo bought the title sponsorship rights for ₹397 crore (US$50 million) for the subsequent five seasons. However, the company terminated the deal in October 2015, two years before the expiry of the contract, reportedly due to the two-season suspension of Chennai and Rajasthan franchises from the league. The BCCI then transferred the title sponsorship rights for the remaining two seasons of the contract to Chinese smartphone manufacturer Vivo for ₹200 crore (US$25 million). In June 2017, Vivo retained the rights for the next five seasons (2018–2022) with a winning bid of ₹2,199 crore (US$280 million), in a deal more expensive than Barclays' Premier League title sponsorship contract between 2013 and 2016. On 4 August 2020, Vivo got out of the title sponsorship rights due to the ongoing military stand-off between India and China at the Line of Actual Control in July 2020. It was also reported that the withdrawal was a result of Vivo's market losses due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation and that it intended to return as the title sponsors for the following three years. Dream11 bagged the title sponsorship for the 2020 IPL for an amount of ₹222 crore. Vivo returned as the title sponsor for the 2021 IPL, but pulled out again, and was replaced by the Tata Group for the next two seasons. InsideSport reported that the BCCI would actually receive ₹498 crore (US$62 million) for the 2022 and 2023 seasons from title sponsors. Vivo had previously agreed to pay a higher amount for the last two seasons of its sponsorship contract due to the expansion of the league from the 2022 season. According to InsideSport, the new deal had been structured such that Tata would pay ₹335 crore (US$42 million) per year while the deficit of ₹163 crore (US$20 million) per season would be paid by Vivo.

Answer:

Here is the name of the sponsor along with the requested details:
DLF - 200 crores - 2008 to 2012
PepsiCo - 297 crores - 2012 to 2015
Vivo - 200 crores - 2015 to 2017
Vivo - 2,199 crores - 2018 to 2019
Dream11 - 220 crores -  2020
Vivo -  2,199 crores - 2021

Which two kings did Sir Oliver Ingham serve under?

Context:

Sir Oliver Ingham (about 1287–1344) was an English knight and landowner who served as a soldier and administrator under King Edward II of England and his successor, King Edward III. He was responsible for the civil government and military defence of the Duchy of Aquitaine during the War of Saint-Sardos and the early part of the Hundred Years' War.

In 1310 he not only inherited his father's lands in Norfolk, Suffolk, Wiltshire and Hampshire but was himself summoned by King Edward II for military service against Scotland. Appointed a household knight of the king, he received many royal grants including the custody of Ellesmere Castle in Shropshire, keeper for the counties of Cheshire and Flintshire, and official positions in Shropshire and Wiltshire. As a knight banneret, he served in Scotland with the king in August 1322.

How many times did Gordie Howe retire?

Context:

Howe retired for the first time in 1971 and was immediately inducted into the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame that same year. He was then inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame the next year, but came back two years later to join his sons Mark and Marty on the Houston Aeros of the WHA. Although in his mid-40s, he scored over 100 points twice in six years, won two straight Avco World Trophies (1974 and 1975) and was named most valuable player in 1974. He made a brief return to the NHL in 1979–80, playing one season with the Hartford Whalers, then retired at age 52. His involvement with the WHA was central to their brief pre-NHL merger success, forcing the NHL to recruit European talent and expand to new markets.

Answer:

Based on the provided information, Howe retired two times.

Howe retired for the first time in 1971, but then later joined his sons Mark and Marty on the Houston Aeros of the WHA. Howe would then return to the NHL in 1979 where he played one season before retiring for a second time.

From the paragraph about Space Needle, tell me where is located, when it was built, how tall the monument is and one more tourist fact about it.

Context:

The Space Needle is an observation tower in Seattle, Washington, United States. Considered to be an icon of the city, it has been designated a Seattle landmark. Located in the Lower Queen Anne neighborhood, it was built in the Seattle Center for the 1962 World's Fair, which drew over 2.3 million visitors.

List all of the call signs mentioned in the paragraph

Context:

WABG-TV's first broadcast was on October 20, 1959, on VHF channel 6. Originally it was a CBS affiliate, with a secondary affiliation with ABC owing to WABG radio (960 AM)'s affiliation with ABC Radio. In 1966, the station built a 1,200-foot (366 m) tower near Inverness and increased its effective radiated power to 100,000 watts. Following its completion in October 1966, WABG dropped CBS to become a full-time ABC affiliate in November 1966. Until then, the only areas of the state to receive a sole ABC affiliate were the northwest (from Memphis' WHBQ-TV) and the Gulf Coast (from WVUE in New Orleans). Until future sister station WXVT signed on in 1980, WJTV in Jackson served as the default CBS affiliate for the southern counties in the Delta area, while WREG-TV in Memphis served the northern half of the market, Mississippi cities like Kosciusko received WABG-TV on their analog television set as their default ABC station from 1970 to 2009, as WAPT in Jackson did not have a strong signal on analog television in the Kosciusko area. On March 12, 1986, the studios of WABG were damaged by a fire triggered by an electrical short circuit after the station signed off the air for the night. With no injuries being reported, the station was forced to relocate its transmission signal.[citation needed]

Who created the scheme programming language?

Context:

Scheme is a dialect of the Lisp family of programming languages. Scheme was created during the 1970s at the MIT AI Lab and released by its developers, Guy L. Steele and Gerald Jay Sussman, via a series of memos now known as the Lambda Papers. It was the first dialect of Lisp to choose lexical scope and the first to require implementations to perform tail-call optimization, giving stronger support for functional programming and associated techniques such as recursive algorithms. It was also one of the first programming languages to support first-class continuations. It had a significant influence on the effort that led to the development of Common Lisp.

Answer:

The scheme programming language was developed by Guy L. Steele and Gerald Jay Sussman during the 1970s at the MIT AI Lab in a series of memos known as the Lambda Papers.

What is a bank?

Context:

Answer:

A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates a demand deposit while simultaneously making loans. Lending activities can be directly performed by the bank or indirectly through capital markets.

Because banks play an important role in financial stability and the economy of a country, most jurisdictions exercise a high degree of regulation over banks. Most countries have institutionalized a system known as fractional-reserve banking, under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, the Basel Accords.

<s> Instruction:

What is the least common birthday?

Context:

Answer:

The least common birthday in the modern Gregorian calendar is February 29. This is because of leap years, as February 29 occurs only a bit more than a quarter of the time in any given calendar year.

However excluding February 29, in most Western countries the least common birthday is December 25. For instance, in the United States between 1973 and 1999, September 16 is the most common birthday and December 25 the least common birthday. Some other uncommon birthdays in the West are January 1, December 24, and April 1.

The least common birthday is usually a holiday when most people take time off work. There are multiple reasons why these days have fewer births, but one reason is that doctors are less likely to schedule cesarean births on such days. April 1 is an exception, and is likely because parents who are able to choose not to give birth on that day, to prevent their children from being bullied for having their birthday on April Fool's Day.

This question is harder to answer in many non-Western countries as there is less easily accessible data. For example in a survey of students in India between 2007 and 2012, the statistics show much more births just before school opens, and on round days like the 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th. This indicates much of the data may be faked.

<s> Instruction:

Given a reference text about the electrolytic detector, when was it replaced and what replaced it?

Context:

The electrolytic detector, or liquid barretter, was a type of detector (demodulator) used in early radio receivers. First used by Canadian radio researcher Reginald Fessenden in 1903, it was used until about 1913, after which it was superseded by crystal detectors and vacuum tube detectors such as the Fleming valve and Audion (triode). It was considered very sensitive and reliable compared to other detectors available at the time such as the magnetic detector and the coherer. It was one of the first rectifying detectors, able to receive AM (sound) transmissions. On December 24, 1906, US Naval ships with radio receivers equipped with Fessenden's electrolytic detectors received the first AM radio broadcast from Fessenden's Brant Rock, Massachusetts transmitter, consisting of a program of Christmas music.

Answer:

The electrolytic detector was replaced around 1913 by crystal and vacuum tube detectors.

Who is William Alfred Bayly?

Context:

William Alfred Bayly (15 July 1906 – 20 July 1934) was a New Zealand farmer and convicted murderer. He was born in Auckland, New Zealand, on 15 July 1906.

In October 1928, Bayly's cousin, 17-year-old Elsie Walker found dead in some scrub in a scoria pit in Panmure, Auckland, with a bruise on her head. Bayly was suspected of killing her, but he was never charged.

Bill Bayly and his wife Phyllis had been dairy farming at Ruawaro, near Huntly, since November 1928. Their neighbours were Samuel and Christobel Lakey. Relations between Bill Bayly and the Lakeys were initially friendly, but soured when Mrs Lakey was said to have accused Bayly of having murdered his niece.

On 16 October 1933 neighbours were concerned as to why the Lakey's cows hadn't been milked that morning. Christobel was discovered lying face down in her pond next to the farmhouse. She had been struck a blow to the face then held down underwater until she drowned. Her husband was missing. Some speculated that her husband had killed her and fled, but it soon became evident that both Lakeys had been the victims of foul play. Two days later bloodstains were found on a wheeled frame near the boundary between the Lakey and Bayly farms, bloodstains were discovered on Bill's sledge, Lakey's guns were found buried in Bayly's swamp, and chemical tests revealed charred bone fragments on a shovel taken from his dairy.

In December Bayly, who had been under surveillance by the police, disappeared, leaving a suicide note. He soon surfaced in Auckland, and was arrested for the murder of Christobel Lakey. More evidence was found in Bayly's garden. Bayly had attempted to incinerate all traces of Lakey. On 10 January 1934 Bayly, was charged with Samuel Lakey's murder.

Bayly was hanged in Mount Eden Prison, Auckland, on 20 July 1934. He was survived by his wife and two young sons.

Police finally buried the remains of Samuel Lakey alongside those of Christobel in Huntly cemetery in 2015. His remains had been used for forensic training.

Answer:

William Alfred Bayly was a New Zealand farmer, who killed his neighbor, Christobel Lakey. He was also suspected of killing others, but was not convicted. He was arrested in Auckland, and was hanged.

From the passage provided, extract the union territories that encompass South India. Separate them with a comma.

Context:

South India, also known as Peninsular India, consists of the peninsular southern part of India. It encompasses the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana, as well as the union territories of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep and Puducherry, comprising 19.31% of India's area (635,780 km2 or 245,480 sq mi) and 20% of India's population. Covering the southern part of the peninsular Deccan Plateau, South India is bounded by the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Arabian Sea in the west and the Indian Ocean in the south. The geography of the region is diverse with two mountain ranges – the Western and Eastern Ghats – bordering the plateau heartland. The Godavari, Krishna, Kaveri, Tungabhadra, Periyar, Bharathappuzha, Pamba, Thamirabarani, Palar, and Vaigai rivers are important perennial rivers.

<s> Instruction:

From this paragraph, tell me how many people lived in Harappa.

Context:

The Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC), also known as the Indus Civilisation was a Bronze Age civilisation in the northwestern regions of South Asia, lasting from 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE, and in its mature form 2600 BCE to 1900 BCE. Together with ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of three early civilisations of the Near East and South Asia, and of the three, the most widespread. Its sites spanned an area from much of Pakistan, to northeast Afghanistan, and northwestern India. The civilisation flourished both in the alluvial plain of the Indus River, which flows through the length of Pakistan, and along a system of perennial monsoon-fed rivers that once coursed in the vicinity of the Ghaggar-Hakra, a seasonal river in northwest India and eastern Pakistan.

The term Harappan is sometimes applied to the Indus civilisation after its type site Harappa, the first to be excavated early in the 20th century in what was then the Punjab province of British India and is now Punjab, Pakistan. The discovery of Harappa and soon afterwards Mohenjo-daro was the culmination of work that had begun after the founding of the Archaeological Survey of India in the British Raj in 1861. There were earlier and later cultures called Early Harappan and Late Harappan in the same area. The early Harappan cultures were populated from Neolithic cultures, the earliest and best-known of which is Mehrgarh, in Balochistan, Pakistan. Harappan civilisation is sometimes called Mature Harappan to distinguish it from the earlier cultures.

The cities of the ancient Indus were noted for their urban planning, baked brick houses, elaborate drainage systems, water supply systems, clusters of large non-residential buildings, and techniques of handicraft and metallurgy. Mohenjo-daro and Harappa very likely grew to contain between 30,000 and 60,000 individuals, and the civilisation may have contained between one and five million individuals during its florescence. A gradual drying of the region during the 3rd millennium BCE may have been the initial stimulus for its urbanisation. Eventually it also reduced the water supply enough to cause the civilisation's demise and to disperse its population to the east.

Although over a thousand Mature Harappan sites have been reported and nearly a hundred excavated, there are five major urban centres: Mohenjo-daro in the lower Indus Valley (declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980 as "Archaeological Ruins at Moenjodaro"), Harappa in the western Punjab region, Ganeriwala in the Cholistan Desert, Dholavira in western Gujarat (declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2021 as "Dholavira: A Harappan City"), and Rakhigarhi in Haryana. The Harappan language is not directly attested, and its affiliation uncertain as the Indus script has remained undeciphered. A relationship with the Dravidian or Elamo-Dravidian language family is favoured by a section of scholars.

Answer:

Mohenjo-daro and Harappa together had a peak population of between 30,000 and 60,000 people

What was the first American college rowing club?

Context:

Modern rowing as a competitive sport can be traced to the early 17th century when professional watermen held races (regattas) on the River Thames in London, England. Often prizes were offered by the London Guilds and Livery Companies. Amateur competition began towards the end of the 18th century with the arrival of "boat clubs" at British public schools. Similarly, clubs were formed at colleges within Oxford and Cambridge in the early nineteenth century. Public rowing clubs were beginning at the same time in England, Germany, and the United States. The first American college rowing club was formed in 1843 at Yale College.

What is the difference between speed and velocity?

Context:

Answer:

Speed and velocity are different terms. Speed is a measurement of distance over time. Velocity is a measurement of distance over time in a direction. Speed is scalar and can only be positive. Velocity is a vector and can either be positive or negative. For example, an object moving at a speed of 50 km/h tells us only how quickly it is moving but not its direction. An object with a velocity of +50 km/h tells us its speed and that it is moving forwards. Conversely, an object with a velocity of -50 km/h tells us its speed and that it is moving backward.

Why some believe that continuous optimisation problems might be easier to solve than discrete optimisation problems?

Context:

Answer:

Some believe that continuous optimisation problems might be easier to solve than their discrete counterparts, owing to the smoothness of the objective functions, which allows the use of calculus techniques. In general, calculus techniques mean to use objective and constraint information at a particular point x, to deduce information about the behaviour of the objective function at all surrounding points close to x. The deduced information is then used to guide the search direction. In contrast, combinatorial optimisation problems are to some extent harder to solve than continuous ones. This is because the behaviour of the objective and constraints may change significantly as we move from one feasible point to another, even if the two points are close according to some measure. Thus it is usually not possible to deduce information about the neighbouring points from the current one.

From the passage provided, extract which companies are local to Seattle which led to its development. Separate them with a comma.

Context:

Logging was Seattle's first major industry, but by the late 19th century, the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush. Growth after World War II was partially due to the local Boeing company, which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing. The Seattle area developed into a technology center from the 1980s onwards with companies like Microsoft becoming established in the region; Microsoft founder Bill Gates is a Seattleite by birth. Internet retailer Amazon was founded in Seattle in 1994, and major airline Alaska Airlines is based in SeaTac, Washington, serving Seattle's international airport, Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. The stream of new software, biotechnology, and Internet companies led to an economic revival, which increased the city's population by almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000

Answer:

Boeing, Microsoft, Amazon, Alaska Airlines

What caused the unprecedented five-game winning streak?

Context:

Richmond enjoys an unprecedented five-game winning streak with Zava on the team, culminating in a win away at Old Trafford against Manchester United. Sam takes the team to celebrate at his yet-to-open Nigerian restaurant, Ola's. Ted is disturbed to learn that his ex-wife Michelle is dating their former couple's therapist, Dr. Jacob; both Sharon and Sassy validate his concern that it is an ethical violation. Jamie feels overshadowed by Zava's stardom; Roy offers to train him. Rebecca visits her mother's psychic Tish, who tells her she will one day be a mother; Rebecca angrily rebuffs Tish as a fraud, but is later stunned when Sam hands her one of the green matchbooks he is giving out to the team, in line with one of Tish's premonitions. Colin introduces his boyfriend Michael to the team as just a friend, but Trent spots them kissing in private while leaving the restaurant.

Answer:

While we don't know exactly what caused the winning streak, it seems clear that a key part of the winning streak was related to Zava being on the team. We know that Jamie is overshadowed by Zava's stardom which tells us that Zava is a star, and we see that Zava was mentioned in relation to the winning streak. Therefore, we can guess that Zava joining the team helped the team to go on a five-game winning streak.

Please give me a bulleted list of the fundamentals of baseball

Context:

Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding. The game occurs over the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).

The principal objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely; this generally occurs either when the batter hits the ball and reaches first base before an opponent retrieves the ball and touches the base, or when the pitcher persists in throwing the ball out of the batter's reach. Players on the batting team who reach first base without being called "out" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners "out", which forces them out of the field of play. The pitcher can get the batter out by throwing three pitches which result in strikes, while fielders can get the batter out by catching a batted ball before it touches the ground, and can get a runner out by tagging them with the ball while the runner is not touching a base.

The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. Most games end after the ninth inning, but if scores are tied at that point, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, though some competitions feature pace-of-play regulations such as the pitch clock to shorten game time.

Answer:

- Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding.
- The object of the game in to score more runs than the opposing team.
- Runs are score only by the batting team during their at bats. While batting you are allowed 3 outs before you will have to switch with the fielding team. 
- A typical baseball game last 9 innings, but there can be extra innings added if there is a tie.

Wthat is the difference between Speed and Velocity ?

Context:

Answer:

Speed denotes only how fast an object is moving, whereas velocity describes both how fast and in which direction the object is moving. If a car is said to travel at 60 miles per hour, its speed has been specified. However, if the car is said to move at 60 miles per hour to the north, its velocity has now been specified.

The big difference can be discerned when considering movement around a circle. When something moves in a circular path and returns to its starting point, its average velocity is zero, but its average speed is found by dividing the circumference of the circle by the time taken to move around the circle. This is because the average velocity is calculated by considering only the displacement between the starting and end points, whereas the average speed considers only the total distance travelled.

How do you change a bicycle tire?

Context:

Answer:

Start by taking off the wheel. For this, open the quick release for the brakes or detach the brake cable. Then, unscrew the axle to take off the wheel. Following, you have to deflate the tire and be able to pull out the tube from underneath the tire. Pry the tire off the rim with tire levers. Once the tire comes off, you can replace the tube and work it back underneath the tire. Remember only to inflate the tube completely once both tube and tire are fitted on the rim. To mount the wheel again, follow the above-described steps in reverse order.

How is Robert Lugn's leadership characterized?

Context:

Lugn was promoted to lieutenant in 1950 and attended the Royal Swedish Army Staff College in from 1955 to 1957 and conducted military studies in Germany, Belgium and The Netherlands in 1956. He became captain of the General Staff Corps in 1960 and was appointed section chief in the Organisation Department of the Army Staff. Lugn conducted military studies in Norway in 1961.

In 1965, Lugn served in the Swedish Battalion in Cyprus, part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) and in 1966 he was promoted to major of the General Staff Corps. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the General Staff Corps in 1968 and served in Göta Life Guards (P 1) in 1970. In 1972, Lugn was promoted to colonel of the General Staff Corps and appointed section chief in the Army Staff. From 1975 to 1977, he served as acting regimental commander of Hälsinge Regiment (I 14) and Gävleborg Defence District (Gävleborgs försvarsområde, Fo 49) when he was promoted to senior colonel and was appointed Chief of Staff of the Western Military District. Lugn was promoted to major general and appointed Chief of the Army Staff and Chief of the General Staff Corps in 1979.

As Chief of the Army Staff, he led the difficult balancing work between quality and quantity in the conscript army within the given financial framework. His written instructions to the staff were marked by a good pen. They expressed his enduring interest in quality in the army's war organization. Lugn's interaction with the staff members was characterized by consideration pairing with great humor. His laid-back leadership style created a good atmosphere that eased employees' sometimes heavy workload. Lugn then served as Chief of Home Guard from 1 October 1983.

As Chief of Home Guard, Lugn made radical changes to the Home Guard. He got the servicemen to accept that they belonged to an army unit and introduced military training to all servicemen. It was revolutionary for the Home Guard, which until then admittedly received weapons training but very little unit training. Now the servicemen were trained in groups and also in working platoons and the training included all the elements that a soldier needs to be able to have. He also made sure that the platoons got heavier weapons such as machine guns and recoilless rifles. Lugn also took hold of the higher education of the commander and introduced a higher education of circuit Home Guard commanders, which led to competence as battalion commander. Lugn served as Chief of Home Guard until his retirement on 1 March 1988.

Answer:

Major General Per Erick Robert Lugn leadership carried a laid back leadership style that ultimately created a good atmosphere, specially easing the workload of the staff members.

Give me some strategies to prevent procrastination

Context:

Answer:

Procrastination is a huge problem for individuals in today's society. Though there are many strategies to beat procrastination, the effectiveness of these strategies is largely dependent on the individual and his/her/their circumstances. Here are some popular strategies to beat procrastination:

1. Set realistic, specific, and time-bound goals. The best goals should have some built-in time delays, but not too much, as to maintain some urgency. Large goals should also be broken into achievable chunks. 

2. Limit your access to distracting media. Making use of your device's focus modes, or locking away your device all together when working can prevent you from being distracted while executing tasks

3. Make the rewards of accomplishing goals tangible and more immediate. A popular strategy for this is temptation bundling, where you bundle a behavior that is good for you in the long-run with a behavior that feels good in the short-run. For example, you may only allow yourself to watch YouTube videos while you are folding laundry.

4. Use support systems. Often, using peers, family, or other individuals in your support system to help hold you accountable is an effective way to encourage task accomplishment. This method also promotes social interaction and continuous discussion of goals with others. As a caveat, you should not become reliant on this method, as it can create burdens on the other individuals in your support system

Conisbrough Castle is a medieval fortification in Conisbrough, South Yorkshire, England. The castle was initially built in the 11th century by William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey, after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Hamelin Plantagenet, the illegitimate, parvenu brother of Henry II, acquired the property by marriage in the late 12th century. Hamelin and his son William rebuilt the castle in stone, including its prominent 28-metre (92 ft)-high keep. The castle remained in the family line into the 14th century, despite being seized several times by the Crown. The fortification was then given to Edmund of Langley, passing back into royal ownership in 1461.

Summarize the lay out of the Jardins du Château Val Joanis

Context:

The Jardins du Château Val Joanis are gardens which belong to the Château Val Joanis winery, located west of the town of Pertuis in the Vaucluse Department of France. The gardens are inspired by the 17th century bastide, or Provençal manor, which stands on the site. They are private but open to the public, and are classified by the French Ministry of Culture among the Remarkable Gardens of France.

History
The Chateau is built on the site of an ancient Roman villa, some of whose stones today decorate the garden. The building is decorated with the coat of arms of Jean de Joanis, the secretary of the King Louis III of Naples. The estate was occupied by the Arnaud family, who kept it until the 17th century. In 1754, the estate was given the status of a fief. The house and estate fell into ruins during the 19th century. It was purchased in 1977 by Jean-Louis Chancel. Between 1979 and 1999, he planted 186 hectares of vines. He also commissioned the architect Jean-Jacques Pichoux to build a modern winery building, inspired by the architectural style of the Dominican Order.

In 1978, Cécile Chancel decided to build a garden in the style of a 17th-century kitchen garden. She had terraces dug on the hillside next to the vineyards, researched different garden styles, and, with the assistance of landscape gardener Tobie Loup de Vian, began building. The garden reached its present form by 1990. It was classified as a Remarkable Garden of France in 2005.
Description
The gardens are laid out on three terraces:

The upper terrace is a kitchen garden and flower garden, featuring lavender cut into spheres, squash, salad plants, fennel, and aromatic plants and herbs. Different varieties of tomatoes are grown on bamboo frames, and there are pyramids of ivy and hops (Humulus lupulus).

The middle terrace features flowers, particularly roses. The paths are bordered with Iris × germanica and with yew trees trimmed into cones.

The lower terrace features fruit trees, particularly old varieties of apples and pears. The garden also has a garden of herbs, a collection of asters, and boxwood hedges trimmed in ornamental forms.

An arbor or pergola covered with climbing roses and trumpet creeper (Campsis) climbs the hill and joins the three terraces.

Tables and seats are placed at scenic spots with views of the garden and the vineyards beyond. The best times to visit the garden are June and July for the flowers, or September for the change of colors of the vineyards and trees.

Answer:

The Jardins du Château Val Joanis are separated into the following three terraces:
- The upper terrace, with a kitchen and flower garden
- The middle terrace, featuring flowers
- The lower terrace, featuring fruit trees

Biography
Early life and legal career
The son of Bráulio Tarquínio de Sousa Amaranto and Joana Oliveira de Sousa, Tarquínio was born in Rio de Janeiro on 7 September 1889. He finished his secondary studies and joined the Faculty of Legal and Social Sciences of Rio de Janeiro, where he graduated with a law degree in 1907, beginning his career in the Postal Office administration and later joining the Postal Service of Rio de Janeiro from 1914 to 1918.

<s> Instruction:

Given this paragraph about grunge guitarists, what types of amplifiers would typically be preferred?

Context:

Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a thick middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet.Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most "lugubrious sound"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive "buildup of sonic fog" or even dismissed as "noise" by one critic.As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.

Answer:

Some grunge guitarists use loud Marshall or Mesa-Boogie amplifiers.

What to do if you drop your iPhone into toilet?

Context:

Answer:

I'm a bit embarrassed to admit this, but I once dropped my new iPhone into the toilet by accident. It's a humbling experience that can happen to anyone. Fortunately, the water was clean and I was able to quickly retrieve the phone. However, the screen was dark, so I used a towel to remove the water and a dryer to dry it out. I then placed the phone in a container of rice and left it overnight. The next day, when I tried turning it on, it worked! I was relieved that I didn't have to buy a new one. The lesson I learned is to be more careful and not put my iPhone near the toilet.

How do you jump start a car?

Context:

Answer:

1. Make sure both batteries have the same voltage (they probably do unless one car is old). Don’t jump start a frozen battery (it may explode), or a battery with cracks in the casing
Keep metal objects away from the battery. If they cause a spark it could be dangerous.

2. Park the two cars facing each other, close but with enough space to walk in between.

3. Remove the keys from the ignitions, turn off lights/blinkers.

4. Disconnect all accessories (voltage spikes can damage them).

5. Clamp one of the red (positive) clamp to the positive terminal of the dead battery. If there is corrosion on the terminal, clean off or scrape the residue, and/or twist the jaws of the clamp until it cuts through the corrosion and into the metal. Make sure the black clamp of the same end isn’t touching any metal.

6. Connect the other red clamp to the positive terminal of the good battery.

7. Connect the black (negative) clamp to the negative terminal of the good battery.

8. Attach the other black clamp to an unpainted metal surface (e.g. bolt, bracket) on the engine of the car with the dead battery, at least a few inches away from the battery. If a labeled remote negative terminal is available, use it.

9. Confirm that the jumper cables are not near any moving engine parts.

10. Start the booster car, and let it idle for 5 minutes to build up a charge in the dead battery. This will take longer if the dead battery is really empty.

11. Start the car with the dead battery and let the two vehicles idle for a few minutes. If the car doesn’t start, wait a few more minutes and try again. In some instances, slightly revving the engine of the running car while charging the dead battery may help. If it still doesn’t start, it probably won’t.

12. Disconnect the jumper cables reversing the connection order, making sure no disconnected clamps touch any metal or each other

13. Drive the jump-started car for at least 20-30 minutes so it can recharge the battery
Try to keep the jumper cables with you; you may need to jump again the next time you start the car.

Why is the band Phish so popular?

Context:

Answer:

Phish have taken influences from many genres of music including rock, metal, blues, jazz, country, latin, barbershop quartet, and americana and blended it into their own take on improvisational jam band rock.  Their music often contains sections that are composed interspersed with long improvisational passages.  Each time you hear one of their songs, in part, it has never been heard before.  The setlists of their live shows are never been repeated, each one is different.  Each of the musicians is virtuosic in their instrument - Trey Anastasio on guitar, Page McConnell on Keyboard, Mike Gordon on bass, and Jon Fishman on drums.  Their live shows are high energy and the music takes fans on a journey.  Their lighting director, Chris Kuroda, is known as the fifth member of the band as the lighting meshes seamlessly with the music.  Phish has been together since 1983 and over the course of the past 40 years they have hundreds of original songs as well as incorporating their own take on many cover songs.  The lyrics range from whimsical to melancholic but are more often geared towards the whimsical side.  Phish is regarded as being one of the most influential bands, along with the Grateful Dead, in the jam band music scene.  Like the Grateful Dead, their fans tend to be incredibly devoted, often traveling to see many shows in a single tour.

Why is JDAM so cost effective?

Context:

The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a guidance kit that converts unguided bombs, or "dumb bombs", into all-weather precision-guided munitions. JDAM-equipped bombs are guided by an integrated inertial guidance system coupled to a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, giving them a published range of up to 15 nautical miles (28 km). JDAM-equipped bombs range from 500 to 2,000 pounds (230 to 910 kg). The JDAM's guidance system was jointly developed by the United States Air Force and United States Navy, hence the "joint" in JDAM. When installed on a bomb, the JDAM kit is given a GBU (Guided Bomb Unit) identifier, superseding the Mark 80 or BLU (Bomb, Live Unit) nomenclature of the bomb to which it is attached.

The JDAM is not a stand-alone weapon; rather it is a "bolt-on" guidance package that converts unguided gravity bombs into precision-guided munitions (PGMs). The key components of the system consist of a tail section with aerodynamic control surfaces, a (body) strake kit, and a combined inertial guidance system and GPS guidance control unit.

The JDAM was meant to improve upon laser-guided bomb and imaging infrared technology, which can be hindered by bad ground and weather conditions. Laser seekers are now being fitted to some JDAMs.

Answer:

The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a guidance kit that converts unguided bombs to precision-guided munitions. There are several reasons why JDAM is one of the most cost effective weapons ever invented.

By using GPS navigation, the JDAM guidance kit can be extremely cheap, as low as $25k/kit.  It is likely cheaper than any other precision-guided weapons.

GPS navigation provides good targeting precision, typically within meters. Combined with blast radius of 500-2000 lbs unguided bombs, JDAM can effectively destroy any targets on the ground.

Because JDAM has navigation capability, pilots no longer need to precisely aim the bombers  against the targets. It allows a bomber to quickly and precisely hit multiple targets along the route.

Some JDAM guidance kits include targeting sensors, such as laser targeting. They can be used against mobile targets, which further increases the use cases for JDAM.

In summary, by combining dumb bombs with a guidance kit, JDAM becomes a very cost effective weapon system, and is widely adopted by the US and other military forces.

In computer science, where did the term big-endian originate?

Context:

Danny Cohen introduced the terms big-endian and little-endian into computer science for data ordering in an Internet Experiment Note published in 1980.

The adjective endian has its origin in the writings of 18th century Anglo-Irish writer Jonathan Swift. In the 1726 novel Gulliver's Travels, he portrays the conflict between sects of Lilliputians divided into those breaking the shell of a boiled egg from the big end or from the little end. Because the emperor's son had cut his finger while opening an egg from the big end, doing so was prohibited by an imperial edict; those who rebelled and did so were called "Big-Endians" (Swift did not use the term Little-Endians in the work). Cohen makes the connection to Gulliver's Travels explicit in the appendix to his 1980 note.

Answer:

Danny Cohen introduced the terms big-endian in an Internet Experiment Note published in 1980. In the appendix to the 1980 note he connected the idea to Gulliver's Travels.

Instruction:

What is the plot of Persuasion by Jane Austen?

Context:

Answer:

Persuasion, published in 1817, is romantic novel with themes of mature love, second chances, and family loyalty.

Persuasion centers around Anne Elliot, who is one of three daughters of Sir Walter Elliot.  Sir Walter is a widower who is conceited and selfish, and spends lavishly and beyond his means, which has forced the family to retrench by renting out their landed estate and relocating to lower-cost Bath.  

Anne is wise and kind but, at 26, is past her prime.  At 19, Anne fell in love with, and accepted a marriage proposal from, Frederick Wentworth, a promising naval commander who is of a lower social status than Anne.  Anne is persuaded by her family (father and older sister) and close friend (Lady Russell) to break off the proposal.  

The novel starts with the family planning for their relocation to Bath, and the Elliots have coincidentally rented their home to the sister and brother-in-law of Frederick Wentworth, now a naval captain.  This provides Captain Wentworth with the opportunity to re-enter Anne’s life and her social circle.  Captain Wentworth has achieved much success and wealth from his naval career.  While Anne immediately notices and admires Captain Wentworth, he initially remains cold to her and commented that she has aged significantly since he last saw her.  The plot takes various twists and turns, with other potential romantic interests for Captain Wentworth and Anne. As Captain Wentworth sees more of Anne, he learns to appreciate and respect her, and ultimately they fall in love again and agree to renew their engagement.

Are you ever too old for anything?

Context:

Answer:

The one thing i will always fiercely & unabashedly resent is the stance that someone is “too old for something” past a certain age. Telling someone they’re “too old” to enjoy a show or practice a hobby or have a personality or do anything that’s not considered “mature” is one of the ugliest standards society has managed to ingrain into people’s brains. Please pursue what makes you happy without shame. if it doesn’t hurt you or anyone else, then it’s no one’s business but yours. You owe no one an explanation. but you do owe yourself authenticity & happiness. And no one can decide how that looks like but you

Which are some famous cuisines from Rajasthan, India?

Context:

Answer:

Rajasthan, whose name is derived from the phrase "Land of Kings," is renowned for its vibrant hues, rich culture, and the Thar Desert. Among other things, Rajasthani food is well renowned throughout the world. Both the availability of ingredients in a desert location and the residents' warlike lives had an impact.  It was preferred to eat food that could be stored for a few days and didn't require heating. Water shortages and a lack of fresh, green vegetables have all had an impact on cooking.

Among the well-known Rajasthani recipes are

Red meat, also known as laal maas or ratto maans, is prepared with yogurt sauce and a unique variety of chiles called red Mathania chillies. Typically, this dish is extremely spicy and loaded with garlic. The royals and rajputs love this meal very much.

Dal Bati with Churma: This is Rajasthan's most well-known dish. Lentils are known as dal, baked wheat balls are known as bati, and sweetened cereal is known as churma. Popular churma is typically served with baatis and dal. It is made of crushed, coarsely powdered wheat that has been fried in ghee and sugar. Traditionally, it is produced by blending leftover rotis or baatis made of wheat flour with ghee and jaggery.

The five plant products ker, sangri, babul fali (kumatiya), gunda, and aamchur make up ker sangri. Since it contains a special combination of five components, it is also known as panchkuta. Ker is a berry that resembles a caper and grows on thorny shrubs in the desert. It has a tart flavor, which also makes it the ideal pickle ingredient. Sangri, on the other hand, are the khejri tree's bean-like pods. The acacia or babul tree's flat seeds are known as babul fali.

What is the plot of the movie John Wick?

Context:

Answer:

John Wick is grieving the death of his wife, Helen, from an illness. To help him cope, she arranged for him to receive a beagle puppy. A few days later, John is accosted at a gas station outside of New York City by a group of Russian gangsters, led by Iosef, who fail to intimidate John into selling them his 1969 Boss 429 Mustang. That night, the men break into John's home and kill the puppy before stealing the car. Iosef takes the Mustang to a chop shop to remove its identifying details, but the shop owner, Aurelio, recognizes the vehicle and refuses service. John learns from Aurelio that Iosef is the son of Viggo Tarasov, the boss of the city's Russian mafia.

Learning of his son's actions, Viggo beats and berates Iosef for incurring John's wrath. Viggo reveals that John was formerly a hitman in his employ, renowned and feared in the criminal underworld as the "Baba Yaga," a ruthless and relentless "man of focus, commitment, and sheer will." After John fell in love with Helen, a civilian, Viggo gave him a seemingly "impossible task" to earn his freedom.

John recovers his concealed stash from his former career, including weapons and gold coins used as underworld currency for special services. He refuses Viggo's attempt to make amends for his son's actions and kills the hit squad subsequently sent to his home. As a result, Viggo puts a $2 million bounty on John's head, and his former mentor Marcus is enlisted to take him out. John lodges in the city at the Continental, a luxurious hotel that serves as neutral ground for the underworld and where conducting criminal "business" is strictly forbidden. The hotel's owner and John's old friend, Winston, secretly informs John that Iosef is at the Red Circle nightclub. John infiltrates the club and confronts Iosef, but he is attacked by Kirill, Viggo's henchman, and forced to retreat to the Continental for medical attention.

As John rests, he is targeted by a hitwoman named Ms. Perkins, who sneaks into his room. Marcus sees Perkins from an adjacent building and fires a warning shot to alert John. He wakes up and subdues Perkins, who reveals that Viggo doubled the bounty for her to kill him in the hotel. She also discloses that Viggo has a high-value stash concealed in a church. John has another hitman, Harry, secure Perkins, but she escapes and kills Harry.

At the church, John destroys Viggo's cache of cash and extensive blackmail material. When Viggo arrives to assess the damage, John assaults him and his men but is captured after being hit by Kirill's car. John tells Viggo that he will not stop until Iosef is dead because the puppy gave him hope and a chance to not be alone in his grief for Helen. Marcus intervenes again to save John, allowing him to kill Kirill and threaten Viggo into revealing his son's location. John assaults the safehouse and kills Iosef. Afterward, Marcus encourages John to return to the everyday life he has built, but their meeting is witnessed by Perkins, who reveals Marcus's duplicity to Viggo. He has Marcus tortured and killed before calling John to taunt him with the details, drawing him back to the city.

Perkins is executed at Winston's behest for breaking the Continental's rules, and Winston informs John that Viggo is preparing to leave the city by helicopter. John races to the New York Harbor, where he fights and mortally wounds Viggo. Resigned to dying from his own injuries, John watches a video on his phone of Helen telling him they need to go home. He breaks into a nearby animal clinic, treats his wounds, and adopts a pitbull puppy scheduled to be euthanized before beginning the walk home.

What are the basic rules of baseball?

Context:

Answer:

Baseball is a complex sport that can be confusing to newcomers. Baseball is a game played by two teams of 9 players on a large field with 4 bases. The team on defense has 9 players out in the field at once, which includes the pitcher and the catcher. The hitting team only has one player "at-bat." The pitcher throws the ball to the catcher, and the hitter attempts to hit the ball into the field and run to a base if they hit the ball into fair territory. If the player misses 3 times, they are out. If the pitcher throws a bad pitch 4 times, the hitter gets to go to first base automatically. The player can also get out if a fielder catches the ball in the air or tags first base before the runner gets there. The game itself is 9 innings of 3 outs for each team. Whoever has the most runs (when a player runs to all 4 bases) at the end of the game wins!

Name China's greatest events happened when Jiang was in charge

Context:

Jiang Zemin (17 August 1926 – 30 November 2022) was a Chinese politician who served as general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from 1989 to 2002, as chairman of the Central Military Commission from 1989 to 2004, and as president of China from 1993 to 2003. Jiang was paramount leader of China from 1989 to 2002. He was the core leader of the third generation of Chinese leadership, one of four core leaders alongside Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and Xi Jinping.

Born in Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Jiang joined the CCP while he was in college. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, he received training at the Stalin Automobile Works in Moscow in the 1950s, later returning to Shanghai in 1962 to serve in various institutes, later being sent between 1970-1972 to Romania as part of an expert team to establish machinery manufacturing plants in the country. After 1979, he was appointed as the vice chair of two commissions by vice premier Gu Mu to oversee the newly-established special economic zones (SEZs). He became the vice minister of the newly-established Ministry of Electronics Industry and a member of the CCP Central Committee in 1982.

Jiang was appointed as the mayor of Shanghai in 1985, later being promoted to its Communist Party secretary, as well as a member of the CCP Politburo, in 1987. Jiang came to power unexpectedly as a compromise candidate following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, when he replaced Zhao Ziyang as CCP general secretary after Zhao was ousted for his support for the student movement. As the involvement of the "Eight Elders" in Chinese politics steadily declined, Jiang consolidated his hold on power to become the "paramount leader" in the country during the 1990s. Urged by Deng Xiaoping's southern tour in 1992, Jiang officially introduced the term "socialist market economy" in his speech during the 14th CCP National Congress held later that year, which accelerated "opening up and reform".

Under Jiang's leadership, China experienced substantial economic growth with the continuation of market reforms. The returning of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997 and of Macau from Portugal in 1999, and entry into the World Trade Organisation in 2001, were landmark moments of his era. China also witnessed improved relations with the outside world, while the Communist Party maintained its tight control over the state. Jiang faced criticism over human rights abuses, including the crackdown on the Falun Gong movement. His contributions to party doctrine, known as the "Three Represents", were written into the CCP constitution in 2002. Jiang gradually vacated his official leadership titles from 2002 to 2005, being succeeded in these roles by Hu Jintao, although he and his political faction continued to influence affairs until much later. On 30 November 2022, Jiang died from leukemia and multiple organ failure in Shanghai.

What makes a Squishmallow resellable?

Context:

Due to the demand for the toy, Squishmallows are often sold by resellers for an increased price. The average resell price for a Squishmallow depends on the size, condition, and rarity of the specific item. Some limited edition or high-demand Squishmallows are sold by resellers and collectors for hundreds or thousands of dollars. Jack the Black Cat, known for its closed white eyes and white whiskers, is one of the rarest Squishmallows sold to date. KellyToys introduced the limited edition stuffed animal on their website in 2020, where it sold out within two hours. Third party websites like eBay host listings for Jack the Black Cat valued at nearly $2,000. Among the many Squishmallows that are sold, some of the most popular include Connor the Cow, Malcolm the Mushroom, Archie the Axolotl, and Philippe the Frog. There are reports that resellers are harassed and doxxed by the community.

Answer:

Squishmallows are a highly demanded toy and also often are sold as limited edition items. As a result, Squishmallows that are more unique and rare can often be sold or higher value later. One example is Jack the Black Cat which has been listed on eBay for nearly $2,000.

What was significant about the 1972 United States presidential election in Missouri

Context:

The 1972 United States presidential election in Missouri took place on November 7, 1972. All fifty states and the District of Columbia were part of the 1972 United States presidential election. Voters chose 12 electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.

Missouri was won by the Republican nominees, incumbent President Richard Nixon of California and his running mate Vice President Spiro Agnew of Maryland. Nixon and Agnew defeated the Democratic nominees, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota and his running mate U.S. Ambassador Sargent Shriver of Maryland.

In a state substantially part of the conservative South, McGovern was viewed by many voters as a left-wing extremist because of his support for busing and civil rights, plus his opposition to the Vietnam War, support for granting amnesty to draft dodgers and support for a thousand-dollar giveaway to each American as a solution to poverty. Many, especially Republican campaigners, also believed McGovern would legalise abortion and illicit drugs if he were elected – despite the fact that his running mate Sargent Shriver was firmly opposed to abortion. These fears of McGovern's social radicalism were especially pronounced amongst poorer whites, who were abundant in the southern part of Missouri.

Nixon carried Missouri with 62.29% of the vote to McGovern's 37.71%, a victory margin of 24.58%. Nixon won all but two jurisdictions: Monroe County and St. Louis City, and was the first Republican to ever carry southern secessionist Mississippi County and Maries County, the first since Abraham Lincoln in 1864 to carry “Little Dixie” Howard and Randolph Counties, and the first since Ulysses S. Grant in 1868 to carry Lewis, Lincoln, Ralls and Ray Counties. As of the 2020 presidential election, this is the last election in which Jackson County, which contains most of Kansas City, as well as Independence, the hometown of former Democratic president Harry S. Truman (who died seven weeks after the election), voted for a Republican presidential candidate.

Answer:

Republican candidate Richard Nixon won the presidential election in Missouri by a significant margin, nearly 25 percent, including wins in many counties that had never voted for a Republican presidential candidate before, or had rarely done so.

<s> Instruction:

I have a question regarding git. I first have a master branch, based on which i created a working branch called feature; we normally send pull request to merge the changes in feature branch to master branch. But then the team has renamed master branch to main, how should i deal with my feature branch, in order to sync with the new main branch and later pull request to merge the changes in feature to main branch instead of master branch.

Context:

Answer:

Here is some suggestions to do this:
1. First create a local “feature” branch from the remote “feature” branch
		git branch -u origin/feature feature
2. Merge the local “main” branch to the local feature branch
		git checkout feature
		git merge main
3. Resolve any conflicts, sync feature with main
4. Commit and push to remote feature
5. Create a pull request to merge from remote feature branch to remote main branch

Write a review of Carlos Ruiz Zafon's book The Shadow of the Wind

Context:

Answer:

What a beautiful book; it reminds me of Murakami - magical yet still very grounded. The Shadow of the Wind has everything going for it: mystical Barcelona, heartwarming characters, poetic language, intriguing plot.

The language and setting of the book was amazing. Zafon is extremely talented, his words are elegant and poetic, and he paints Barcelona in a myriad of different ways: dark and gothic at night, or blissfully cheerful, or dreary gloom, all depending on the characters.

I loved the cast of Shadow of the Wind. Each character was well developed and given an appropriate backstory. They bumped into each other in mysterious turns, and their interactions, like Daniel and Clara, or Daniel and Nuria, were heart wrenching.

But most of all, Zafon tells a wonderful story. I loved the parallels between Julian Carax and Daniel, and how Daniel's life becomes entangled with Julian's. It makes it feel much more like magical realism, and makes for an entertaining read.

What is Acyl-CoA?

Context:

Answer:

Acyl-CoA is a group of coenzymes that metabolize fatty acids. Acyl-CoA's are susceptible to beta oxidation, forming, ultimately, acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle, eventually forming several equivalents of ATP. In this way, fats are converted to ATP, the universal biochemical energy carrier.

Why do Filipinos like eating rice so much?

Context:

Answer:

Well, that has to do with the fact that the Filipino soil is ideal for rice cultivation. Also, given that rice is produced in abundance in the Phillipines, it becomes cheaper than other food staples. Therefore, rice easily became the most common dish in an ordinary Filipino household.
One can also say, that the neutral nature of rice flavour parries well with the Filipino traditional dishes like Adobo, Sinigang and Kare-Kare which are rich in flavour and welcome more neutral side dishes

Given the following summary of the book "Human Compatible" by Stuart Russell, what is the author's proposal to overcome the limitations of the standard approach for developing AI?

Context:

Russell begins by asserting that the standard model of AI research, in which the primary definition of success is getting better and better at achieving rigid human-specified goals, is dangerously misguided. Such goals may not actually reflect what human designers intend, such as by failing to take into account any human values not included in the goals. If an AI developed according to the standard model were to become superintelligent, it would likely not fully reflect human values and could be catastrophic to humanity. Russell asserts that precisely because the timeline for developing human-level or superintelligent AI is highly uncertain, safety research should be begun as soon as possible, as it is also highly uncertain how long it would take to complete such research.

Russell argues that continuing progress in AI capability is inevitable because of economic pressures. Such pressures can already be seen in the development of existing AI technologies such as self-driving cars and personal assistant software. Moreover, human-level AI could be worth many trillions of dollars. Russell then examines the current debate surrounding AI risk. He offers refutations to a number of common arguments dismissing AI risk and attributes much of their persistence to tribalism—AI researchers may see AI risk concerns as an "attack" on their field. Russell reiterates that there are legitimate reasons to take AI risk concerns seriously and that economic pressures make continued innovation in AI inevitable.

Russell then proposes an approach to developing provably beneficial machines that focuses on deference to humans. Unlike in the standard model of AI, where the objective is rigid and certain, this approach would have the AI's true objective remain uncertain, with the AI only approaching certainty about it as it gains more information about humans and the world. This uncertainty would, ideally, prevent catastrophic misunderstandings of human preferences and encourage cooperation and communication with humans. Russell concludes by calling for tighter governance of AI research and development as well as cultural introspection about the appropriate amount of autonomy to retain in an AI-dominated world.

Answer:

Russell suggests that the AIs should be trained in a way that makes them gradually gain knowledge of what is truly beneficial to humans. AIs developed in this fashion would cooperate with humans while leaving them with a high enough level of autonomy.

Summarise why lightweight rowing event was at risk in Olympics

Context:

The first lightweight events were added to the World Championships in 1974 for men and 1985 for women. Lightweight rowing was added to the Olympics in 1996 but this came under threat in 2002 when the Programme Commission of the IOC recommended that, outside combat sports and weightlifting, there should not be weight category events. The executive board overturned this recommendation and lightweight rowing continues at the Olympics, though only in the men's and women's double sculls.

Answer:

The Programme Commission was of the opinion that only combat sports and weightlifting should have weight categories. No other sport with weight categorisations should be allowed.

Without directly quoting from the text, give me a summary of the second home controversy in Gwynedd, Wales.

Context:

Controversy erupted in mid-winter 2001 when Seimon Glyn, Gwynedd Council's housing committee chairman and Plaid Cymru member, voiced frustration over "English immigrants" moving into traditionally Welsh speaking communities. Glyn was commenting on a report underscoring the dilemma of rocketing house prices outstripping what locals could pay, with the report warning that "...traditional Welsh communities could die out..." as a consequence.

In 2001 nearly a third of all purchases of properties in Gwynedd were by buyers from out of the county, with some communities reporting as many as a third of local homes used as holiday homes. Holiday home owners typically spend less than six months of the year in the local community.

The issue of locals being priced out of the local housing market is common to many rural communities throughout Britain, but in Wales the added dimension of language further complicates the issue, as many new residents do not learn the Welsh language.

Concerned for the Welsh language under these pressures, Glyn said "Once you have more than 50% of anybody living in a community that speaks a foreign language, then you lose your indigenous tongue almost immediately". His comments attracted strong criticism of Plaid Cymru from other national parties.

By spring 2002 both the Snowdonia National Park (Welsh: Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri) and Pembrokeshire Coast National Park (Welsh: Parc Cenedlaethol Arfordir Penfro) authorities began limiting second home ownership within the parks, following the example set by Exmoor. According to planners in Snowdonia and Pembroke applicants for new homes must demonstrate a proven local need or the applicant must have strong links with the area.

Answer:

By the end of 2001, as much as a third of the homes in the Gwynedd county was owned by owners not using these houses as a primary home. The local community was concerned that the use of the Welsh language was at risk because a growing amount of owners did only speak English, not Welsh. To combat this phenomenon, two national parks in the county started limiting second home ownership in the area, requiring proof of local need or strong ties in the area.

is daylight saving necessary at all?

Context:

Answer:

Absolutely no! Daylight Savings originated around WWI in an effort to conserve fuel and electricity. US enacted the act to preserve Daylight saving time in 1918 and established standard time zone across the States. However, with modern power grids and diverse night life, Daylight Savings is seemingly not relevant today. A lot of people complain about the inconvenience in turning the clock back and forth twice a year. The rate of being late for schedules or air flights on the day of daylight saving starts or ends every year is much higher than any other day in a year. In fact, even in the US, Arizona and Hawaii do not recognize daylight saving time. So do a lot of other countries like China and Japan. For European countries, the daylight saving switch date differs from one to another. All the chaos of daylight saving cause more trouble in schedule across-region appointments and meetings than any benefits of it if we can think of any.

What is sourdough bread?

Context:

Answer:

Sourdough bread does not use yeast to rise. Instead it uses a starter, which is fermented dough, as its rising agent. Hence it is classified as a naturally leavened bread. It normally takes longer for a sourdough bread to rise. Sourdough bread is more flavourful than normal bread. 

The starter is created using flour, salt and water. It has to be "fed" and maintained with fresh flour for the starter to remain alive. Staters can be stored in a cooler environment in order to slow down the fermentation prices.

What is a whiteboard?

Context:

A whiteboard (also known by the terms marker board, dry-erase board, dry-wipe board, and pen-board) is a glossy, usually white surface for making non-permanent markings. Whiteboards are analogous to blackboards, but with a smoother surface allowing for rapid marking and erasing of markings on their surface. The popularity of whiteboards increased rapidly in the mid-1990s and they have become a fixture in many offices, meeting rooms, school classrooms, public events and other work environments.

The term whiteboard is also used metaphorically in reference to features of computer software applications that simulate whiteboards. Such "virtual tech whiteboards" allow one or more people to write or draw images on a simulated canvas. This is a common feature of many virtual meeting, collaboration, and instant messaging applications. The term whiteboard is also used to refer to interactive whiteboards.

<s> Instruction:

Given the below reference text about Luftwaffe, tell me for how many years was this military organisation active officially in Germany?

Context:

The Luftwaffe was the aerial-warfare branch of the German Wehrmacht before and during World War II. Germany's military air arms during World War I, the Luftstreitkräfte of the Imperial Army and the Marine-Fliegerabteilung of the Imperial Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 in accordance with the terms of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles which banned Germany from having any air force.

During the interwar period, German pilots were trained secretly in violation of the treaty at Lipetsk Air Base in the Soviet Union. With the rise of the Nazi Party and the repudiation of the Versailles Treaty, the Luftwaffe's existence was publicly acknowledged on 26 February 1935, just over two weeks before open defiance of the Versailles Treaty through German rearmament and conscription would be announced on 16 March. The Condor Legion, a Luftwaffe detachment sent to aid Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War, provided the force with a valuable testing ground for new tactics and aircraft. Partially as a result of this combat experience, the Luftwaffe had become one of the most sophisticated, technologically advanced, and battle-experienced air forces in the world when World War II broke out in September 1939. By the summer of 1939, the Luftwaffe had twenty-eight Geschwader (wings). The Luftwaffe also operated a paratrooper force known as the Fallschirmjäger.

The Luftwaffe proved instrumental in the German victories across Poland and Western Europe in 1939 and 1940. During the Battle of Britain, however, despite inflicting severe damage to the RAF's infrastructure and, during the subsequent Blitz, devastating many British cities, the German air force failed to batter the beleaguered British into submission. From 1942, Allied bombing campaigns gradually destroyed the Luftwaffe's fighter arm. From late 1942, the Luftwaffe used its surplus ground support and other personnel to raise Luftwaffe Field Divisions. In addition to its service in the West, the Luftwaffe operated over the Soviet Union, North Africa and Southern Europe. Despite its belated use of advanced turbojet and rocket-propelled aircraft for the destruction of Allied bombers, the Luftwaffe was overwhelmed by the Allies' superior numbers and improved tactics, and a lack of trained pilots and aviation fuel. In January 1945, during the closing stages of the Battle of the Bulge, the Luftwaffe made a last-ditch effort to win air superiority, and met with failure. With rapidly dwindling supplies of petroleum, oil, and lubricants after this campaign, and as part of the entire combined Wehrmacht military forces as a whole, the Luftwaffe ceased to be an effective fighting force.

After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Luftwaffe was disbanded in 1946. During World War II, German pilots claimed roughly 70,000 aerial victories, while over 75,000 Luftwaffe aircraft were destroyed or significantly damaged. Of these, nearly 40,000 were lost entirely. The Luftwaffe had only two commanders-in-chief throughout its history: Hermann Göring and later Generalfeldmarschall Robert Ritter von Greim for the last two weeks of the war.

Answer:

The Luftwaffe was officially active for about 11 years - 1935 to 1946.

Who is the greatest golfer of all time?

Context:

Answer:

The greatest golfer of all time is a highly contested topic, although a few names come to mind for any golfer in the modern era. Many folks will look at the players who have won the most Major events, of which there are only four each year. The winningest golfer based on number of Major wins is Jack Nicklaus, and the second winningest golfer is Tiger Woods. 

Many would say that means Jack Nicklaus is the greatest golfer of all time, however greatness can also be measured by one's impact on the game. Tiger Woods opened the door for an entire generation of young players coming from diverse backgrounds. This is a fundamental change to a sport that is historically a game of privilege and aristocracy. 

I would argue that the combination of having a winning record in Major events and having a significant cultural impact on the game makes Tiger Woods the greatest and most influential golfer of all time.

Who are the top Presidents of USA

Context:

Answer:

Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and George Washington are most often listed as the three highest-rated presidents among historians. 
More recent presidents such as Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton are often rated among the greatest in public opinion polls, but generally do not rank as highly among presidential scholars and historians. 
Because William Henry Harrison and James A. Garfield both died within their first year in office, they are often omitted from presidential rankings. Zachary Taylor died after serving as president for only 16 months, but he is usually included. In the case of these three presidents, it is not clear whether they received low rankings due to their actions as president or because each was in office for such a limited time that they did not accomplish much.

Given this text, what are the oldest and newest major territories of the United States?

Context:

American Samoa: territory since 1900; after the end of the Second Samoan Civil War, the Samoan Islands were divided into two regions. The U.S. took control of the eastern half of the islands. In 1900, the Treaty of Cession of Tutuila took effect. The Manuʻa islands became part of American Samoa in 1904, and Swains Island became part of American Samoa in 1925. Congress ratified American Samoa's treaties in 1929. For 51 years, the U.S. Navy controlled the territory. American Samoa is locally self-governing under a constitution last revised in 1967.[note 14] The first elected governor of American Samoa was in 1977, and the first non-voting member of Congress was in 1981. People born in American Samoa are U.S. nationals, but not U.S. citizens. American Samoa is technically unorganized, and its main island is Tutuila.

Guam: territory since 1899, acquired at the end of the Spanish–American War. Guam is the home of Naval Base Guam and Andersen Air Force Base. It was organized under the Guam Organic Act of 1950, which granted U.S. citizenship to Guamanians and gave Guam a local government. In 1968, the act was amended to permit the election of a governor.

Northern Mariana Islands: A commonwealth since 1986, the Northern Mariana Islands together with Guam were part of the Spanish Empire until 1899 when the Northern Marianas were sold to the German Empire after the Spanish–American War. Beginning in 1919, they were administered by Japan as a League of Nations mandate until the islands were captured by the United States in the Battle of Saipan and Battle of Tinian (June–August 1944) and the surrender of Aguigan (September 1945) during World War II. They became part of the United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) in 1947, administered by the United States as U.N. trustee. The other constituents of the TTPI were Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. Following failed efforts in the 1950s and 1960s to reunify Guam and the Northern Marianas, a covenant to establish the Northern Mariana Islands as a commonwealth in political union with the United States was negotiated by representatives of both political bodies; it was approved by Northern Mariana Islands voters in 1975, and came into force on March 24, 1976. In accordance with the covenant, the Northern Mariana Islands constitution partially took effect on January 9, 1978, and became fully effective on November 4, 1986. In 1986, the Northern Mariana Islands formally left U.N. trusteeship. The abbreviations "CNMI" and "NMI" are both used in the commonwealth. Most residents in the Northern Mariana Islands live on Saipan, the main island.

Puerto Rico: unincorporated territory since 1899; Puerto Rico was acquired at the end of the Spanish–American War, and has been a U.S. commonwealth since 1952. Since 1917, Puerto Ricans have been granted U.S. citizenship. Puerto Rico was organized under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950 (Public Law 600). In November 2008, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that a series of Congressional actions have had the cumulative effect of changing Puerto Rico's status from unincorporated to incorporated. The issue is proceeding through the courts, however, and the U.S. government still refers to Puerto Rico as unincorporated. A Puerto Rican attorney has called the island "semi-sovereign". Puerto Rico has a statehood movement, whose goal is to make the territory the 51st state. See also Political status of Puerto Rico.

U.S. Virgin Islands: purchased by the U.S. from Denmark in 1917 and organized under the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands in 1954. U.S. citizenship was granted in 1927. The main islands are Saint Thomas, Saint John and Saint Croix.

Answer:

The United States has five major territories. Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands. Of those, the two oldest are Guam, and Puerto Rico; both being acquired in 1899 at the end of the Spanish - American War. The Northern Mariana Islands is the newest of the five major territories, joining the United States in 1986.

What is High-functioning autism?

Context:

High-functioning autism (HFA) is an autism classification where a person exhibits no intellectual disability but may show deficits in communication, emotion recognition and expression, and social interaction.HFA is not included in the American Psychological Association's DSM-5 or the World Health Organization's ICD-10, subdividing autism based on intellectual capabilities. High-functioning autism is characterised by features similar to those of Asperger syndrome. The defining characteristic psychologists recognise there is a significant delay in developing early speech and language skills before three years. The diagnostic criteria of Asperger syndrome exclude a general language delay.

Other differences in features of people with high-functioning autism from those with Asperger syndrome include the following:

Lower verbal reasoning ability
Better visual/spatial skills (Being uniquely artistically talented)
Less deviating locomotion (e.g. clumsiness)
Problems functioning independently
Curiosity and interest in many different things
Not as good at empathising with other people
Male to female ratio (4:1) is much smaller

As of 2013, Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism are no longer terms the American Psychological Association uses and have been merged into autism spectrum disorder (ASD). As of 2021, the World Health Organization also retired the terms and merged them into autism spectrum disorder.

Please tell me the main global sources of energy production

Context:

Energy production is 80% fossil, half of which is produced by China, the United States and the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. The Gulf States and Russia export most of their production, largely to the European Union and China, where not enough energy is produced to satisfy demand. Energy production is increasing 1 to 2% per year, except for solar and wind energy which averaged 20% per year in the 2010s.

Answer:

The main sources of energy production are fossil, accounting for around 80% of the total energy generation. Around half of the energy generation by fossil sources is produced by China, the United States and the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. Energy production from renewable sources such as solar and wind has increased at an average of 20% yearly which is much higher than the growth of the rest of the sources at an average of 1% to 2% yearly.

Who won the 2000 World Series?

Context:

The 2000 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2000 season. The 96th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between crosstown opponents, the two-time defending World Series champions and American League (AL) champion New York Yankees and the National League (NL) champion New York Mets.

The series was often referred to as the "Subway Series", referring to the longstanding matchup between New York baseball teams; it was the first World Series contested between two New York teams since the 1956 World Series and the first since the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers moved west to California (as the current San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers, respectively) in 1958 and the subsequent formation of the Mets in 1962. This World Series that featured teams from the same city or state, was the first of its kind since 1989 between the Oakland Athletics and the San Francisco Giants. Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter was named the World Series Most Valuable Player.

Answer:

New York Yankees defeated the NY Mets 4 games to 1

What is Dogecoin?

Context:

Answer:

Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to create a payment system as a "joke", making fun of the wild speculation in cryptocurrencies at the time. It is considered both the first "meme coin", and more specifically the first "dog coin". Despite its satirical nature, some consider it a legitimate investment prospect. Dogecoin features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the "doge" meme as its logo and namesake.

is Aadhaar a proof of residence or of citizenship?

Context:

Aadhaar is a 12-digit unique identity number that can be obtained voluntarily by the citizens of India and resident foreign nationals who have spent over 182 days in twelve months immediately preceding the date of application for enrolment, based on their biometric and demographic data. The data is collected by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), a statutory authority established in January 2009 by the Government of India, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, following the provisions of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, benefits and services) Act, 2016.
Aadhaar is the world's largest biometric ID system. World Bank Chief Economist Paul Romer described Aadhaar as "the most sophisticated ID programme in the world". Considered a proof of residence and not a proof of citizenship, Aadhaar does not itself grant any rights to domicile in India. In June 2017, the Home Ministry clarified that Aadhaar is not a valid identification document for Indians travelling to Nepal and Bhutan.
Prior to the enactment of the Act, the UIDAI had functioned, since 28 January 2009, as an attached office of the Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog). On 3 March 2016, a money bill was introduced in the Parliament to give legislative backing to Aadhaar. On 11 March 2016, the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, benefits and services) Act, 2016, was passed in the Lok Sabha.

Answer:

Considered a proof of residence and not a proof of citizenship, Aadhaar does not itself grant any rights to domicile in India.

Why did the Prix Lupin not take place from 1915 to 1918?

Context:

The event was established in 1855, and it was originally called the Prix de l'Empereur. It was initially held at the Champ de Mars, and was transferred to Longchamp in 1857. It was cancelled due to the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, and was renamed the Grande Poule des Produits in 1872.

The race was one of several trials for the Prix du Jockey Club collectively known as the Poules des Produits. The others (listed by their modern titles) were the Prix Daru, the Prix Hocquart, the Prix Noailles and the Prix Greffulhe. Unlike those races, the Grande Poule des Produits had no restrictions based on the nationality of a horse's sire or dam.

The event was renamed in memory of Auguste Lupin (1807–1895), a successful owner-breeder, in 1896.

The Prix Lupin was abandoned throughout World War I, with no running from 1915 to 1918. It was cancelled once during World War II, in 1940. It was run at Le Tremblay over 2,150 metres in 1943, and at Maisons-Laffitte in 1944.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and the Prix Lupin was classed at Group 1 level.

The race was last run in 2004. It was discontinued after France Galop restructured its Group 1 programme for three-year-olds in 2005.

Answer:

Due to the first World War

What was the 97th Rifle Division

Context:

The 97th Rifle Division was thrice formed as an infantry division of the Red Army, first as part of the prewar buildup of forces. The first formation was based on the pre-September 1939 shtat (table of organization and equipment) and the division was initially intended to serve in the fortifications along the border with Poland in western Ukraine. Beginning on September 17, 1939 it took part in the invasion of eastern Poland and then was moved north to join the 7th Army and later the 13th Army on the Karelian Isthmus during the Winter War against Finland where it saw action in the latter part of the struggle. Following this it returned to western Ukraine where it was on the border at the time of the German invasion in June 1941. At considerable cost it was able to retreat back to the Dniepr River south of Kiev during July and was still there as part of 26th Army when the Soviet forces in eastern Ukraine were largely surrounded and wiped out in September. The division was finally disbanded in late December.

Will robots ever feel and think like humans? Will these robots solve all of our problems, or will they spell the end of the human race?

Context:

Answer:

Imagine a world where hundreds of robots are working with humans. Some of them deliver food, and some might be working at a cafe or a restaurant. They are all around us, helping people to do many things. Sometimes, they can do what humans can’t do, and they can also sometimes perform better than humans. Nowadays, many scientists and engineers are arguing if artificial intelligence could dramatically make our lives better, or would it spell the end of the human race?
    Robots and Artificial Intelligence(A.I. for short) are developing systematically but dramatically, so someday, they might feel and think like humans. For example, some robots can “feel” pain by detecting how strong the force is to technically “feel” the pain. Furthermore, robots can think like humans by programming them to think how humans do. However, robots have less flexible thinking, since they are only doing what others programmed them to do, especially robots like Industrial robots that are less complex.
    However, because A.I. is developing at a great speed, it might eventually become a threat to the human race. Many people such as Steven Hawkings warned that as A.I. develops further, they might be unstoppable, and might become one of the most dangerous enemies. Furthermore, according to the UN, A.I. might have stereotypical thoughts about certain races because of people’s discriminative behavior, and it can further have an impact on judgment between many kinds of people. Primarily, robots and A.I. can be a threat to the human race, so we need to take care of its program and rule it better so that it can be a good tool that can improve our lives.
    On the other hand, I think that although now, A.I. still has some difficulties in doing certain things, A.I. can solve some of our problems, and make our lives better, and easier. A.I. can solve many problems, and they can even do some work better than humans. For example, robots can go to dangerous places like space, deep sea, and poisonous areas. Furthermore, robots can do dangerous jobs like welding which is dangerous work that needs to be done precisely. Robots are used in places like this because Industrial robots can do work precisely, and they can even save the worker’s life. For another example, a remote robot called Canadarm2 that works in the International Space Station can help astronauts by doing work in space to help the other astronauts that make their life easier.
    In conclusion, A.I. is starting to become part of our lives since it’s starting to think and feel like humans with a great speed, and although it might become a threat to human races, I still think A.I. can solve many problems by doing what we have trouble doing. Once, Nick Boston claimed that “Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to invent” which means that humans only need to make A.I. because it can do things that other materials can, and it can also create and build itself. Since robots and A.I. can do many things that can help people, A.I. starting to become our reliable assistants as long as we take care of them.

Where did the random walk hypothesis come from?

Context:

The random walk hypothesis is a financial theory stating that stock market prices evolve according to a random walk (so price changes are random) and thus cannot be predicted.
The concept can be traced to French broker Jules Regnault who published a book in 1863, and then to French mathematician Louis Bachelier whose Ph.D. dissertation titled "The Theory of Speculation" (1900) included some remarkable insights and commentary. The same ideas were later developed by MIT Sloan School of Management professor Paul Cootner in his 1964 book The Random Character of Stock Market Prices. The term was popularized by the 1973 book A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton Malkiel, a professor of economics at Princeton University, and was used earlier in Eugene Fama's 1965 article "Random Walks In Stock Market Prices", which was a less technical version of his Ph.D. thesis. The theory that stock prices move randomly was earlier proposed by Maurice Kendall in his 1953 paper, The Analysis of Economic Time Series, Part 1: Prices.

Answer:

It is said that the random walk hypothesis originated back in the mid 1800s from a French financier named Jules Regnault.  The random walk hypothesis notes that stock price movements are fully random and cannot be easily forecast.

Answer:

Breckenridge, Colorado is largely known for its ski resort of the same name. Breckenridge is one of the highest-altitude tourist destinations in the United States, at an elevation of approximately 9600 feet (or 2926 meters). It has a small year-round resident population (a few thousand people), but has millions of visitors every year. Breckenridge Ski Resort operates across five peaks, and includes a chairlift that operates at 12,840 feet (the highest in North America). Although Breckenridge gets more than 300 inches of snow on average each year, it also has abundant sunshine with about 300 days being sunny. Breckenridge has cold winters and moderate summers.

Why does it rain?

Context:

Answer:

Rain is droplet of water falling from the sky. In the water life cycle, water from water bodies on earth evaporates and become clouds. The water droplets in the cloud coalesce and get bigger. When clouds become saturated, or get bigger and bigger, that the air can no longer hold it, they fall down as rain.

What are financial instruments?

Context:

Answer:

Financial instruments are monetary contracts between parties. They can be created, traded, modified and settled. They can be cash (currency), evidence of an ownership interest in an entity or a contractual right to receive or deliver in the form of currency (forex); debt (bonds, loans); equity (shares); or derivatives (options, futures, forwards).

International Accounting Standards IAS 32 and 39 define a financial instrument as "any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity".

Financial instruments may be categorized by "asset class" depending on whether they are equity-based (reflecting ownership of the issuing entity) or debt-based (reflecting a loan the investor has made to the issuing entity). If the instrument is debt it can be further categorized into short-term (less than one year) or long-term. Foreign exchange instruments and transactions are neither debt- nor equity-based and belong in their own category.

Why is Chicago known as the Windy City

Context:

Answer:

Many believe that Chicago is known as the Windy City because it has harsh winters and strong cold winds off the shores of Lake Michigan. Even in the summer, the winds swirling off the lake can change the outcome of a baseball game at Wrigley Field.  While the weather pattern does in fact exist, Chicago is not the windiest city, nor is this the reason for the nickname. Many believe the term is a derogatory reference to  Chicago's vitriolic politics and self-important politicians who are  full of  hot air.  References to Chicago as the Windy City have been found all the way back to the late 1800s.

Why are the Green Bay Packers called the Packers?

Context:

Needing to outfit his new squad, team founder Curly Lambeau solicited funds from his employer, the Indian Packing Company. He was given $500 for uniforms and equipment in return for the team being named for its sponsor. An early newspaper article referred to the fledglings as "the Indians", but by the time they played their first game "Packers" had taken hold.

Indian Packing was purchased in 1920 by the Acme Packing Company. Acme continued to support the team, which played its first NFL season with "ACME PACKERS" emblazoned on its jerseys.

Answer:

The Green Bay Packers are called the Packers because in 1920, the team founder, Curly Lambeau asked his employer, the Indian Packing Company for money to help buy uniforms and equipement.  In return for the funding, the team was named after the sponser.

Why do we have a threefold repetition rule in chess?

Context:

In chess, the threefold repetition rule states that a player may claim a draw if the same position occurs three times during the game. The rule is also known as repetition of position and, in the USCF rules, as triple occurrence of position. Two positions are by definition "the same" if the same types of pieces occupy the same squares, the same player has the move, the remaining castling rights are the same and the possibility to capture en passant is the same. The repeated positions need not occur in succession. The reasoning behind the rule is that if the position occurs three times, no real progress is being made and the game could hypothetically continue indefinitely.

The game is not automatically drawn if a position occurs for the third time – one of the players, on their turn, must claim the draw with the arbiter. The claim must be made either before making the move which will produce the third repetition, or after the opponent has made a move producing a third repetition. By contrast, the fivefold repetition rule requires the arbiter to intervene and declare the game drawn if the same position occurs five times, needing no claim by the players.

Answer:

This rule is to ensure the game ends and does not continue indefinitely.

What is SMTP?

Context:

Answer:

The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is an Internet standard communication protocol for electronic mail transmission. Mail servers and other message transfer agents use SMTP to send and receive mail messages. User-level email clients typically use SMTP only for sending messages to a mail server for relaying, and typically submit outgoing email to the mail server on port 587 or 465 per RFC 8314. For retrieving messages, IMAP (which replaced the older POP3) is standard, but proprietary servers also often implement proprietary protocols.

According to the passage, mention some of Taylor’s early albums.

Context:

Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her genre-spanning discography, songwriting abilities and artistic reinventions have received critical praise and wide media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country artist to write a U.S. platinum-certified album.
Swift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" were the first country songs to top the U.S. pop and all-genre airplay charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", and eschewed her country image in her synth-pop album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do".
Exiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She ventured into indie folk and alternative rock in her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, whose singles "Cardigan" and "Willow" topped the Hot 100. Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over their masters, re-releasing two in 2021—Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version). The latter's "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Her 2022 album Midnights and single "Anti-Hero" broke all-time streaming records. Swift has directed music videos and films, such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and played supporting roles in others.
Having sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians in history. She is the most streamed woman on Spotify and the only act to have five albums open with over one million copies sold in the US. Among her accolades are 12 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; an Emmy Award; 40 American Music Awards; 29 Billboard Music Awards; three IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards; and 92 Guinness World Records. Swift has been featured in rankings such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100. Honored with titles such as Artist of the Decade and Woman of the Decade, Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and women's empowerment. Her music is credited with influencing a generation of singers and songwriters.

Career
Born in Whitehall, Dublin, Dunphy first became famous in his home country as lead singer with The Hoedowners, a showband led by trumpeter Earl Gill. Between 1966 and 1973, fourteen singles by Sean Dunphy and The Hoedowners entered the Irish Charts including, in 1969, two number ones: "Lonely Woods of Upton" and "When The Fields Were White With Daisies". In the late 1970s, Dunphy went on to have two further hits as a solo artist.

What are the names of the general purpose registers in the x86-64 architecture?

Context:

In addition to increasing the size of the general-purpose registers, the number of named general-purpose registers is increased from eight (i.e. eax, ecx, edx, ebx, esp, ebp, esi, edi) in x86 to 16 (i.e. rax, rcx, rdx, rbx, rsp, rbp, rsi, rdi, r8, r9, r10, r11, r12, r13, r14, r15). It is therefore possible to keep more local variables in registers rather than on the stack, and to let registers hold frequently accessed constants; arguments for small and fast subroutines may also be passed in registers to a greater extent.

Answer:

The x86-64 architecture has 16 general purpose registers. They are named rax, rcx, rdx, rbx, rsp, rbp, rsi, rdi, r8, r9, r10, r11, r12, r13, r14, and r15.

Who is the greatest hockey player of all time?

Context:

Answer:

Although some may make arguments that Sydney Crosby, Conor McDavid, Bobby Orr or Gordie Howe are the greatest hockey player of all time, the obvious answer is Wayne Gretzky.  Gretzky won the NHL's scoring title by more than 70 points, six times, and one eight consecutive NHL MVP awards (the Con Smythe).  If Gretzky never scored a single goal in his career, he still would have recorded 11 straight 100-point seasons and won four league-scoring titles.  Also, in addition to winning eight Stanley Cups, Wayne's teams never missed the playoffs throughout his 20-year career.  Wayne Gretzky is the most dominant athlete in the history of major professional team sports and that is the reason why he has earned the nickname, 'The Great One.'

From the passage identify the founders of Confinity. Display the results in comma separated format.

Context:

PayPal was originally established by Max Levchin, Peter Thiel, and Luke Nosek in December 1998 as Confinity, a company that developed security software for hand-held devices. Having had no success with that business model, however, it switched its focus to a digital wallet. The first version of the PayPal electronic payments system was launched in 1999.
In March 2000, Confinity merged with x.com, an online financial services company founded in March 1999 by Elon Musk, Harris Fricker, Christopher Payne, and Ed Ho. Musk was optimistic about the future success of the money transfer business Confinity was developing. Musk and Bill Harris, then-president and CEO of X.com, disagreed about the potential future success of the money transfer business and Harris left the company in May 2000. In October of that year, Musk decided that X.com would terminate its other internet banking operations and focus on payments. That same month, Elon Musk was replaced by Peter Thiel as CEO of X.com, which was renamed PayPal in June 2001 and went public in 2002. PayPal's IPO listed under the ticker PYPL at $13 per share and generated over $61 million.

Max Levchin, Peter Thiel, Luke Nosek

Please give me the keypoints about Mehmed II's reign

Context:

Mehmed II (Ottoman Turkish: محمد ثانى, romanized: Meḥmed-i s̱ānī; Turkish: II. Mehmed, pronounced [icinˈdʒi ˈmehmed]; 30 March 1432 – 3 May 1481), commonly known as Mehmed the Conqueror (Ottoman Turkish: ابو الفتح, romanized: Ebū'l-fetḥ, lit. 'the Father of Conquest'; Turkish: Fâtih Sultan Mehmed), was an Ottoman sultan who ruled from August 1444 to September 1446, and then later from February 1451 to May 1481.

In Mehmed II's first reign, he defeated the crusade led by John Hunyadi after the Hungarian incursions into his country broke the conditions of the truce Peace of Szeged. When Mehmed II ascended the throne again in 1451, he strengthened the Ottoman navy and made preparations to attack Constantinople. At the age of 21, he conquered Constantinople and brought an end to the Byzantine Empire. After the conquest, Mehmed claimed the title Caesar of the Roman Empire (Ottoman Turkish: قیصر‎ روم, romanized: Qayser-i Rûm), based on the fact that Constantinople had been the seat and capital of the surviving Eastern Roman Empire since its consecration in 330 AD by Emperor Constantine I. The claim was only recognized by the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Nonetheless, Mehmed II viewed the Ottoman state as a continuation of the Roman Empire for the remainder of his life, seeing himself as "continuing" the Empire rather than "replacing" it.

Mehmed continued his conquests in Anatolia with its reunification and in Southeast Europe as far west as Bosnia. At home he made many political and social reforms, encouraged the arts and sciences, and by the end of his reign, his rebuilding program had changed Constantinople into a thriving imperial capital. He is considered a hero in modern-day Turkey and parts of the wider Muslim world. Among other things, Istanbul's Fatih district, Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge and Fatih Mosque are named after him.

Answer:

Mehmed II also known as Mehmed the Conqueror was an Ottoman Sultan who reigned from 1432 to 1481. He is known for conquering Constantinople, ending the Byzantine Empire and greatly expanded the Ottoman empire.

Does having a real cork, artificial cork, or a screw-top have any impact on the quality of a bottle of wine?

Context:

Answer:

Generally, no. There is little evidence to suggest any one closure is more superior than another for most wines. It is more important to have an airtight seal on a bottle of wine so as to prevent introduction of air into the bottle which would cause oxidation of the wine inside.

What makes bread rise?

Context:

Answer:

There are various techniques and ingredients used in the bread making process to make it rise. Yeast can be used in the dough which will activate and the dough will rise over a number of hours (or even days) depending on the type of bread you are making. Another method is natural fermentation ie sourdough. Sourdough bread rises by using a "pre-ferment" or sourdough starter when mixing the dough. Typically sourdough requires a longer rise time for the development of the air bubbles and the sour taste by which the name comes from.

Give me a brief summary of the spanish civil war

Context:

The Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936: on 17 and 18 July, part of the military carried out a coup d'état that triumphed in only part of the country. The situation led to a civil war, in which the territory was divided into two zones: one under the authority of the Republican government, that counted on outside support from the Soviet Union and Mexico (and from International Brigades), and the other controlled by the putschists (the Nationalist or rebel faction), most critically supported by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. The Republic was not supported by the Western powers due to the British-led policy of non-intervention. General Francisco Franco was sworn in as the supreme leader of the rebels on 1 October 1936. An uneasy relationship between the Republican government and the grassroots anarchists who had initiated a partial Social revolution also ensued.


Republican volunteers at Teruel, 1936
The civil war was viciously fought and there were many atrocities committed by all sides. The war claimed the lives of over 500,000 people and caused the flight of up to a half-million citizens from the country. On 1 April 1939, five months before the beginning of World War II, the rebel side led by Franco emerged victorious, imposing a dictatorship over the whole country. Thousands of men and women were imprisoned after the civil war in Francoist concentration camps, with approximately 367,000 to 500,000 prisoners being held in 50 camps or prisons.

Answer:

The Spanish Civil War started on the 17th and 18th of July 1936 due to a coup d'etat by the military that divided the country into two zones, one side led by the republican government, the other controlled by the putschists (nationalists). The war claimed 500,000 lives and caused a mass exodus of up to 500,000 more. It ended on the 1st of April 1939 with the nationalists taking control of the country, imposing a dictatorship led by General Franco.

Where did xiaolongbao originate from and what are some key types

Context:

"Xiaolongbao" originated in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, by Wan Hua Tea House in the years of Daoguang Emperor (1820 to 1850). Xiaolongbao evolved from the guantangbao (soup-filled dumplings/buns) from Kaifeng, Henan province, the capital city of Northern Song Dynasty (AD 960–1127).

There are numerous styles of xiaolongbao in Jiangsu cuisine. Shanghai-style xiaolongbao originated in Nanxiang, which was a neighboring village of Shanghai in Jiangsu that eventually ended up becoming an outer suburb of Shanghai's Jiading District. The inventor of xiaolongbao sold them in his first store in Nanxiang next to the town's notable park, Guyi Garden. From there the xiaolongbao expanded into downtown Shanghai and outward. The Suzhou and Wuxi styles are larger (sometimes twice as large as a Nanxiang-style soup dumpling) and have sweeter fillings. The Nanjing style is smaller with an almost translucent skin and less meat.

Answer:

Xiaolongbao were first seen in Chengzhou which is located in Jiangsu province.
Since it's humble beginnings it has spread far and wide and there exist many variants.
A few common types are the:
- Shanghai Style
- Suzhou Style
- Wuxi Style
- Nanjing Style

Polly, a 51-year-old female, visits your fitness facility. She is dissatisfied with her body and is responding to a series of ads your facility uses to attract people interested in weight loss. What new behaviors and habits could she adopt to optimize weight control?

Context:

Answer:

She can focus on three new behaviors: attitude rewiring, prioritizing consistency, and emotional control. First, she can adopt a new attitude towards health and fitness; instead of thinking of working out as a necessarily hard and unenjoyable task, she can start perceiving her workouts in a positive light. Instead of seeking to accomplish unrealistic goals, she can start small and focus on consistency, finding tasks that are both easy and enjoyable for her (such as walking a dog). Finally, because people tend to sabotage their good diets or workout plans due to distressing events, she needs to adopt emotional discipline, recognizing stressful situations and ensuring she is not acting purely out of stress.

Describe the sensation of taking a cold shower and explain the rationale for why someone might take one.

Context:

Answer:

When you take a shower with very cold water, you throw your body into a temporary state of shock. You feel your skin raise. Your toes may curl a bit. Your eyes may widen. If it is early morning and you're still waking up, you may find that you suddenly feel very alert. 

By leaving a room with a warm and comfortable temperature and entering a space with water produced at a chilly and uncomfortable temperature you actually trick your body. The sudden shift produces alertness that can be beneficial for people who are trying to wake up without caffeine and other stimulants or are otherwise trying to train their bodies to tolerate harsh conditions.

Why will the Golden State Warriors win the 2023 NBA Finals?

Context:

Answer:

The Warriors have been a dynasty for over 10 years now and with Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green still playing they will always be a contender for the foreseeable future. Steph Curry is still playing like he is in his prime even at age 35 and he has solidified himself as the greatest player of all time. With the playoffs about to start, the warriors will most likely play the Sacramento Kings in which it looks as if it is an easy sweep for them to build momentum and confidence to carry themselves to another title this year.

Summarize the battle of Pävankhind.

Context:

Battle of Pävankhind was a rearguard last stand that took place on 13 July 1660, at a mountain pass in the vicinity of fort Vishalgad, near the city of Kolhapur with the Maratha warrior Baji Prabhu Deshpande and Sambhu Singh Jadhav against Siddi Masud of the Bijapur Sultanate. The engagement ended with the destruction of the Maratha forces, and a tactical victory for the Bijapur Sultanate that failed to achieve a strategic victory.

Answer:

In 1660, Shivaji Maharaj was trapped in the fort of Panhala, under siege and vastly outnumbered by an Adilshah army led by an Abyssinian General called Siddi Masud. Shivaji Maharaj planned to escape to the Maratha fort of Vishalgad. Two Maratha sardars under the Adilshahi General Siddi Jouhar, namely Suryarao Surve and Jaswantrao Dalvi had also encircled the fort of Vishalgad simultaneously. Shivaji Maharaj waited for months, planning and depleting the Adilshah's food source.

Shivaji Maharaj, Baji Prabhu, and around 600 of their best troops, would dash through the Adilshahi force at night. A man named Shiva Kashid, who resembled Shivaji Maharaj in appearance, had volunteered to dress like the king and get captured. This bought some additional time due to the confusion over identity, before Siddi Masud realised the error and gave chase.


Baji Prabhu Deshpande Statue in Panhala Fort
Shivaji Maharaj made his escape on the dark night of 13 July, with his troops and the Adilshah army was in pursuit with an army of 10,000. It was clear that there was no way to shake off the enemy, and that the Marathas would not simultaneously prevail over both the Moghul garrison at Vishalgad and the chasing Adilshahi army.

The only option was for a section of the Marathas to stay back and fight the larger Adilshahi forces in a rearguard action, while the rest of the Marathas would carry on to their destination. Shivaji Maharaj decided to split his forces. Baji Prabhu agreed to face the troops of Bijapur with 300 soldiers. Shivaji Maharaj told Baji Prabhu that he would hear cannons being fired 5 times from Vishalgad, signaling Shivaji Maharaj’s safety. The strategic position of Ghod Khind (Horse Pass) was chosen for the defence, as it was very narrow and only a few soldiers could pass at any one time.

What is a proof that there are two irrational numbers where raising one to the power of the other produces a rational number?

Context:

Answer:

Here is a proof by cases that there exist two irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational. First, consider a = b = sqrt(2). Recall that sqrt(2) is irrational, so If a^b = sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) is rational, we are done because we have found irrational a and b with a^b being a rational number. Otherwise, sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) is irrational. Let a = sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) and b = sqrt(2). Then a ^ b = (sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2)) ^ sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) ^ (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) = sqrt(2) ^ 2 = 2, which is rational. So either way, we can find irrational a and b with a^b being rational.

What makes a good password?

Context:

Answer:

Good passwords consist of a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.  Good passwords should be long, easy for the user to remember, but hard to guess.  Most attempts to steal passwords use brute force, so the length of the password is more important in terms of the compute needed to discover it using brute force methods than would be special characters.  Special characters used in short passwords also prove ineffective because there are many well know leet dictionaries that provide common special character insertions.

What is Cricket in sports?

Context:

Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.

Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (each "over" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasting three hours, to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.

What is the origin of shortbread cookies?

Context:

A cookie (American English), or a biscuit (British English), is a baked or cooked snack or dessert that is typically small, flat and sweet. It usually contains flour, sugar, egg, and some type of oil, fat, or butter. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, nuts, etc.

Most English-speaking countries call crunchy cookies "biscuits", except for the United States and Canada, where "biscuit" refers to a type of quick bread. Chewier biscuits are sometimes called "cookies" even in the United Kingdom. Some cookies may also be named by their shape, such as date squares or bars.

Biscuit or cookie variants include sandwich biscuits, such as custard creams, Jammie Dodgers, Bourbons and Oreos, with marshmallow or jam filling and sometimes dipped in chocolate or another sweet coating. Cookies are often served with beverages such as milk, coffee or tea and sometimes dunked, an approach which releases more flavour from confections by dissolving the sugars, while also softening their texture. Factory-made cookies are sold in grocery stores, convenience stores and vending machines. Fresh-baked cookies are sold at bakeries and coffeehouses.

Why was Advani concerned about Modi’s appointment as a chief minister of Gujarat?

Context:

In 2001, Keshubhai Patel's health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel's standing had been damaged by his administration's handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001. The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel's administration, was chosen as a replacement. Although Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi's lack of experience in government, Modi declined an offer to be Patel's deputy chief minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee that he was "going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all". On 3 October 2001 he replaced Patel as chief minister of Gujarat, with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the December 2002 elections. On 7 October, he was sworn in, and entered the Gujarat state legislature on 24 February 2002 by winning a by-election to the Rajkot – II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC.

Answer:

For Modi being a candidate  for the chief minister of Gujarat, Advani was concerned about Modi’s lack of political experience.

<s> Instruction:

Are the racial depictions of Eugène Delacroix artworks facts?

Context:

Racial categories have historically been used as a way to enable an oppressive figure or group to discriminate against other groups or individuals which were seen as different from that of the oppressor. In nineteenth and early twentieth century Europe, artwork was a common form of racialization which targeted countries in the Middle East and Asia. The artwork, predominantly paintings, were portrayed in order to instill prejudice in the Western populations through sexualizing and manipulating images. One of the most prominent examples of Orientalist work in art is a piece by Eugène Delacroix titled Women of Algiers in their Apartment. Dating back to 1834, it portrays three women resting in a harem in exotic clothing while an African woman is dressed in plain clothing, depicting her role as a servant. Fine textiles, hookahs, and other paraphernalia adorn the room, which represents a European fantasy of an exotic scene. Attempts to portray these cultures as strange, foreign and exotic through Orientalism led to intolerance towards the Arab and Asian communities in Europe and the United States. Others argue that Delacroix, who travelled in North Africa sketching extensively, was depicting a realistic scene of the era based on his first-hand knowledge and experience. In such an interpretation the clothing, for example, is consistent with the times, as Arab North Africans dressed differently from Europeans, and kept black slaves who would not have been treated as equals.

Answer:

There are arguments that some of the depictions of the artworks are factual represents of Delacroix's first-hand experience while traveling in North Africa.

<s> Instruction:

Is black hole truly black?

Context:

A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light or other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape its event horizon. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.

Answer:

According to general relativity, a black hole emits no lights at all. Thus it is 100% black by definition. However, when quantum effects are included, a black hole has finite temperature,  emitting lights called Hawking radiation. In this sense, a black hole is not truly black.

Is it possible to build a society that runs completely on socialism without any capitalism elements?

Context:

Answer:

It is theoretically possible to build a society that runs completely on socialism without any capitalism elements, but based on the human history so far, there are challenges that are difficult to overcome. As a socialist society relies on a centralized organization for distribution of resources rather than relying on free market, the challenges include inefficient decision making, corruption of power, etc.

How do you make soap?

Context:

Answer:

Soap is made with a mixture of natural or organic oils, sodium hydroxide and distilled water.  When making soap you need to mix a combination of light and heavy oils like olive and coconut oil and then mix it with sodium hydroxide and distilled water.  After this mixture has been mixed well you poor it into soap molds and let it hard over the course of many weeks.  This process called saponification is the time it takes for the sodium hydroxide to evaporate from the mixture which causes the soap to harden in he soap molds.  Other options you have when making soap are to add essential oils, like lavender and grapefruit to give a nice scent to the soap.  This has to be added prior to saponification.

The Apollo program, also known as Project Apollo, was the third United States human spaceflight program carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which succeeded in preparing and landing the first humans on the Moon from 1968 to 1972. It was first conceived in 1960 during President Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration as a three-person spacecraft to follow the one-person Project Mercury, which put the first Americans in space. Apollo was later dedicated to President John F. Kennedy's national goal for the 1960s of "landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth" in an address to Congress on May 25, 1961. It was the third US human spaceflight program to fly, preceded by the two-person Project Gemini conceived in 1961 to extend spaceflight capability in support of Apollo.

What is a dispersive prism?

Context:

In optics, a dispersive prism is an optical prism that is used to disperse light, that is, to separate light into its spectral components (the colors of the rainbow). Different wavelengths (colors) of light will be deflected by the prism at different angles. This is a result of the prism material's index of refraction varying with wavelength (dispersion). Generally, longer wavelengths (red) undergo a smaller deviation than shorter wavelengths (blue). The dispersion of white light into colors by a prism led Sir Isaac Newton to conclude that white light consisted of a mixture of different colors.

Answer:

A dispersive prism is an optical prism that disperses the light's different wavelengths at different angles. When white light is shined through a dispersive prism it will separate into the different colors of the rainbow.

What is structural biology?

Context:

Answer:

Structural biology is a field that is many centuries old which, as defined by the Journal of Structural Biology, deals with structural analysis of living material (formed, composed of, and/or maintained and refined by living cells) at every level of organization. Early structural biologists throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries were primarily only able to study structures to the limit of the naked eye's visual acuity and through magnifying glasses and light microscopes.

In the 20th century, a variety of experimental techniques were developed to examine the 3D structures of biological molecules. The most prominent techniques are X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron microscopy. Through the discovery of X-rays and its applications to protein crystals, structural biology was revolutionized, as now scientists could obtain the three-dimensional structures of biological molecules in atomic detail. Likewise, NMR spectroscopy allowed information about protein structure and dynamics to be obtained. Finally, in the 21st century, electron microscopy also saw a drastic revolution with the development of more coherent electron sources, aberration correction for electron microscopes, and reconstruction software that enabled the successful implementation of high resolution cryo-electron microscopy, thereby permitting the study of individual proteins and molecular complexes in three-dimensions at angstrom resolution.

With the development of these three techniques, the field of structural biology expanded and also became a branch of molecular biology, biochemistry, and biophysics concerned with the molecular structure of biological macromolecules (especially proteins, made up of amino acids, RNA or DNA, made up of nucleotides, and membranes, made up of lipids), how they acquire the structures they have, and how alterations in their structures affect their function. This subject is of great interest to biologists because macromolecules carry out most of the functions of cells, and it is only by coiling into specific three-dimensional shapes that they are able to perform these functions. This architecture, the "tertiary structure" of molecules, depends in a complicated way on each molecule's basic composition, or "primary structure." At lower resolutions, tools such as FIB-SEM tomography have allowed for greater understanding of cells and their organelles in 3-dimensions, and how each hierarchical level of various extracellular matrices contributes to function (for example in bone). In the past few years it has also become possible to predict highly accurate physical molecular models to complement the experimental study of biological structures. Computational techniques such as Molecular Dynamics simulations can be used in conjunction with empirical structure determination strategies to extend and study protein structure, conformation and function.

Given a reference text about Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries of Denmark, when was the position created and was was it named?

Context:

Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries of Denmark (Danish: Minister for Fødevarer, Landbrug og Fiskeri) is the politically appointed head of the Danish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, and a member of the Cabinet. Since 19 November 2020, Rasmus Prehn, from the social democratic party Socialdemokratiet, has served as Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries in the Mette Frederiksen I cabinet.

The ministry and the minister post was created in 1896; the ministry was originally named the Ministry of Agriculture. In 1929 the Directorate of Fishing was spun off into the separate Ministry of Shipping and Fishing, but that ministry was reabsorbed in 1935, and the name changed to Ministry of Agriculture and Fishing. In 1947 the Ministry of Fishing was created again, and the name changed to the Ministry of Agriculture, and this time it lasted until 1994 where it was again folded into the Ministry of Agriculture and Fishing. On 30 December 1996 the name of the ministry was changed to the current Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, often just called the Ministry of Food.

Answer:

The Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries of Denmark position was created in 1896 and was originally named the Ministry of Agriculture.

Tell me about the football career of Adao

Context:

Carlos Manuel Pereira Pinto (born 3 April 1960), commonly known as Adão, is a Portuguese former footballer who played as a central midfielder.

Club career
Born in Chaves, Vila Real District, Adão started his career with hometown club G.D. Chaves, moving to the Primeira Liga in 1980 with Varzim SC. He appeared in only eight games in his first season, which ended in relegation, but helped with 27 and three goals to an immediate promotion.

In summer 1985, Adão joined Vitória de Guimarães. In his second year he played 30 matches as starter and scored twice – including once in 1–0 away win over S.C. Braga in the Minho derby – as his team finished in third position.

Adão signed with C.F. Os Belenenses for 1988–89. On 12 October 1988, in that campaign's UEFA Cup, he scored the game's only goal at home against Bayer 04 Leverkusen, as the Lisbon side ousted the title holders 2–0 on aggregate. Later in the season he also appeared in the final of the Portuguese Cup, won after beating S.L. Benfica.

Aged 30, Adão moved to F.C. Penafiel, spending his last three years (of five overall) in the second division. Over the course of 11 seasons, he amassed top-tier totals of 279 games and 16 goals.

Answer:

(1) You can insulate your house better.  This can often be done cheaply, such as by covering your windows with plastic during the winter.  You can also invest in permanent insulation such as double-paned windows and new attic insulation.
(2) You can wear warmer clothing and turn down the heat.  It's not too bad to bundle up during the winter!
(3) You can invest in a heat pump.  Heat pumps are more energy-efficient than traditional heaters.

Context:

Answer:

Spain is a large country where you can find all of those things. This would be my top 5, but there are many other places that are worth it. Since you are not specifying the time you will spend in Spain, I will exclude the islands (Balearic Islands and Canary Islands) from the list:

- Madrid: the capital city of Spain has some of the top museums in Europe, like the Prado or the Reina Sofia Museums. It is a city with a great atmosphere, and has some of the best restaurants in the country.
- Barcelona: a mediterranean global city with a lot to offer - from Antonio Gaudi's architectural masterpieces to beaches and awesome views of the Mediterranean sea.
- Galicia: a region located in northwestern Spain. Not very touristic, but with amazing places like Santiago de Compostela, and amazing restaurants and gastronomy.
- Sevilla: the largest city in Southern Spain, full of history, museums and amazing places to eat.
- Costa del Sol: one of the best places in Spain to visit the beach and get some sunlight. As its name states (Sun Coast), you will get sunny weather all year round.

Who invented the computer?

Context:

Answer:

Charles Babbage is widely credited with having conceived the idea for the first computer, and indeed he has been referred to as the "father of computing." His designs led to the creation of the world's first digital device - "the Difference Engine". Babbage's ideas were picked up by Ada Lovelace, who described an algorithm to compute Bernoulli numbers using one of his proposed devices. In documenting this algorithm, Lovelace has been recognised as the world's first computer programmer, and in the notes that accompanied it she is also credited with making the first distinction between hardware and software. 

Alan Turing is often recognised as being the father of modern computer science, and for developing the first modern computers. During the Second World War, Turing's devices broke the Enigma Code, which was used by the Germans to encode all of their military communications. In so doing, Turing is credited with saving millions of lives. After the war, Turing published a detailed design for an "Automatic Computing Engine" (ACE), which very much a precursor of the modern computer, even storing its programs in memory. 

In 1950, Turing published a paper describing what become known as the "Turing Test" - a method to compare human and machine outputs. This paper is widely seen as being a seminal moment in the development of Artificial Intelligence.

What is sweep rowing?

Context:

Rowing, sometimes called crew in the United States, is the sport of racing boats using oars. It differs from paddling sports in that rowing oars are attached to the boat using oarlocks, while paddles are not connected to the boat. Rowing is divided into two disciplines: sculling and sweep rowing. In sculling, each rower holds two oars—one in each hand, while in sweep rowing each rower holds one oar with both hands. There are several boat classes in which athletes may compete, ranging from single sculls, occupied by one person, to shells with eight rowers and a coxswain, called eights. There are a wide variety of course types and formats of racing, but most elite and championship level racing is conducted on calm water courses 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) long with several lanes marked using buoys.

Answer:

Sweep rowing is a rowing discipline in which rowers hold one oar with both hands.

These personal expenditures fall under one of the following categories: durable goods, nondurable goods, and services. Examples include food, rent, jewelry, gasoline, and medical expenses, but not the purchase of new housing.
I (investment) includes, for instance, business investment in equipment, but does not include exchanges of existing assets. Examples include construction of a new mine, purchase of software, or purchase of machinery and equipment for a factory. Spending by households (not government) on new houses is also included in investment. In contrast to its colloquial meaning, "investment" in GDP does not mean purchases of financial products. Buying financial products is classed as 'saving', as opposed to investment. This avoids double-counting: if one buys shares in a company, and the company uses the money received to buy plant, equipment, etc., the amount will be counted toward GDP when the company spends the money on those things; to also count it when one gives it to the company would be to count two times an amount that only corresponds to one group of products. Buying bonds or companies' equity shares is a swapping of deeds, a transfer of claims on future production, not directly an expenditure on products; buying an existing building will involve a positive investment by the buyer and a negative investment by the seller, netting to zero overall investment.
G (government spending) is the sum of government expenditures on final goods and services. It includes salaries of public servants, purchases of weapons for the military and any investment expenditure by a government. It does not include any transfer payments, such as social security or unemployment benefits. Analyses outside the USA will often treat government investment as part of investment rather than government spending.
X (exports) represents gross exports. GDP captures the amount a country produces, including goods and services produced for other nations' consumption, therefore exports are added.
M (imports) represents gross imports. Imports are subtracted since imported goods will be included in the terms G, I, or C, and must be deducted to avoid counting foreign supply as domestic.
Note that C, I, and G are expenditures on final goods and services; expenditures on intermediate goods and services do not count. (Intermediate goods and services are those used by businesses to produce other goods and services within the accounting year.) So for example if a car manufacturer buys auto parts, assembles the car and sells it, only the final car sold is counted towards the GDP. Meanwhile, if a person buys replacement auto parts to install them on their car, those are counted towards the GDP.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, which is responsible for calculating the national accounts in the United States, "In general, the source data for the expenditures components are considered more reliable than those for the income components [see income method, above]."

Encyclopedia Britannica records an alternate way of measuring exports minus imports: notating it as the single variable NX.[23

Answer:

The following are the five components of GDP by expenditure:
- Consumption: Private expenditures in the economy
- Investment: Includes business investments, but not exchanges of assets
- Government Spending: Sum of government spend on goods and services
- Exports: Gross exports
- Imports: Gross imports

What is beta oxidation?

Context:

Answer:

In biochemistry and metabolism, beta oxidation (also β-oxidation) is the catabolic process by which fatty acid molecules are broken down in the cytosol in prokaryotes and in the mitochondria in eukaryotes to generate acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle, and NADH and FADH2, which are co-enzymes used in the electron transport chain. It is named as such because the beta carbon of the fatty acid undergoes oxidation to a carbonyl group. Beta-oxidation is primarily facilitated by the mitochondrial trifunctional protein, an enzyme complex associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane, although very long chain fatty acids are oxidized in peroxisomes.

Context:

Answer:

Of the given list, the Alto Saxophone, Clarinet, and Oboe are woodwind instruments because they all generate sound with a reed. Contrarily, the Trumpet, Trombone, and Horn are brass instruments. This family's instruments are made of brass, and the players vibrate their lips to produce a sound. The drum is neither a woodwind nor a brass instrument but part of the percussion instrument family.

Extract the list of countries that have part of the Amazon rainforest. Place them in a bullet list

Context:

The Amazon rainforest, also called Amazon jungle or Amazonia, is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000 km2 (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000 km2 (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations and 3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous territories.

The majority of the forest, 60%, is in Brazil, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. Four nations have "Amazonas" as the name of one of their first-level administrative regions, and France uses the name "Guiana Amazonian Park" for French Guiana's protected rainforest area. The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees in about 16,000 species.

More than 30 million people of 350 different ethnic groups live in the Amazon, which are subdivided into 9 different national political systems and 3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous territories. Indigenous peoples make up 9% of the total population, and 60 of the groups remain largely isolated.

Can you give me some reasons why Hockey is not as popular in the United States as many other sports?

Context:

Answer:

Yes,

1. Hockey requires a field of ice which can only naturally occur in colder climates which limits the geographic appeal of the sport. Also, ice rinks are not as readily available around the country as, say, a soccer field or basketball court.

2. Hockey is an expensive sport to play. One needs to purchase pads, sticks, helmets, and other gear, as well as rent out an ice rink for practices and games.

3. In addition to cost, the barrier for entry related to skill is quite high compared to most other sports. One must first be able to ice skate before playing hockey which is a skill many people don't have.

Based on the following passage which dried fruit is sold the most?

Context:

Dried fruit is fruit from which the majority of the original water content has been removed either naturally, through sun drying, or through the use of specialized dryers or dehydrators. Dried fruit has a long tradition of use dating back to the fourth millennium BC in Mesopotamia, and is prized because of its sweet taste, nutritive value and long shelf life.
Today, dried fruit consumption is widespread. Nearly half of the dried fruits sold are raisins, followed by dates, prunes, figs, apricots, peaches, apples, and pears. These are referred to as "conventional" or "traditional" dried fruits: fruits that have been dried in the sun or in heated wind tunnel dryers. Many fruits such as cranberries, blueberries, cherries, strawberries, and mango are infused with a sweetener (e.g. sucrose syrup) prior to drying. Some products sold as dried fruit, like papaya, kiwifruit and pineapple, are most often candied fruit.
Dried fruits retain most of the nutritional value of fresh fruits. The specific nutrient content of the different dried fruits reflects their fresh counterpart and the processing method.

Answer:

Today, dried fruit consumption is widespread and nearly half of the dried fruits sold are raisins.

I'm going to give you a passage from Marty Essen's book "Cool Creatures, Hot Planet: Exploring the Seven Continents" and want you to answer the following question: Where are western Hermann's tortoises found?

After spending the night at a large chain hotel, Deb and I traveled southeast with tortoises on our mind. Our plan for the day was to infiltrate the Massif des Maures area and search for one of France's most endangered reptiles-- the western Hermann's tortoise.  The first stop of our quest was Le Village de Tortues (the Tortoise Village), a tortoise rehabilitation center near the town of Gonfaron. Our mission was to befriend a staff member, learn as much as we could, and get detailed information on tracking down the wily Hermann's tortoise in the wild. When we couldn't find an English-speaking staff member, our mission was nearly thwarted. Only through quick thinking and improvisation were we able to acquire the vital background information we needed. Okay - we utilized the signs provided for British visitors. For many people, the word tortoise invokes thoughts of giant four-foot-long Galapagos tortoises. Western Hermann's tortoises, on the other hand, are small, reaching a maximum length of eight inches. While both reptiles make the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the Galapagos tortoise is listed as "vulnerable" and the western Hermann's is listed as "endangered." In France, habitat destruction, egg pilfering, and fire are the primary factors for the tortoises decline.

Western Hermann's tortoises are found in France, in a turtle rehabilitation village, Le Village de Tortues, near Gonfaron.

What did ancient cultures around the Mediterranean know about electricity?

Context:

Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the "Thunderer of the Nile", and described them as the "protectors" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.
Ancient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.
Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.
Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus ("of amber" or "like amber",, elektron, the Greek word for "amber") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words "electric" and "electricity", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.
Further work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges
In 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian Ørsted and André-Marie Ampère in 1819–1820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his "On Physical Lines of Force" in 1861 and 1862. 
While the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.
In 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for "his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.
The first solid-state device was the "cat's-whisker detector" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.
Solid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.

Write a story about a budding romance between two people. Talk about their going on an adventure together where they sneak into a fancy garden in Washington DC and get into just the right amount of trouble.

Context:

Answer:

Natalie and I woke up the morning after a fun night out.  I was in DC that week for a work trip, and had extended my stay the weekend before and after, so we could spend time together. We'd only met a month prior, and after more than four weeks of long-distance text message exchanges,  it was exciting to finally be together in person. Our first date had been the weekend before, when we'd gone to a Jimmy Buffett concert. It was a magical night.
It was now 10am on the Saturday after the work week, and we were ready for another adventure.  Natalie, being from DC, wanted to show me the Dumbarton Oaks Gardens, so off we went.  Unfortunately, when we got there, the front gates were closed.  Still feeling adventurous, we decided to walk around the property, convinced we'd find an unlocked gate, door, or other way to get in.  Towards the back end of the property, while we didn't find an open gate, we did find one that was scale-able.  And that's exactly what we did.  We climbed over that fence, and welcomed ourselves to the beautiful gardens.  It was early august, and so much was still in bloom.  The gardens were empty,  and we thought we had the whole place to ourselves.  But, we soon found that that wasn't the case.  While exploring a small cottage that also seemed to double as an art gallery, we noticed a small pool right next to it.  We also noticed someone swimming in that pool. Presumably that person noticed us too, because a few minutes later a security guard came walking up to us while we were inspecting some fine smelling roses nearby.  It was too late to run away, so instead we walked up to the security guard, and thanked him for finding us.  As they escorted us out, we complimented them on the great state of the garden, though that didn't seem to calm him down much.  He was far too frustrated with the situation.  As they were about to lead us out through the front gate, we offered to pay for our admission.  They rather sternly refused, and insisted we leave immediately, which we did.  
And that's how Natalie and I got our free tour of the gardens, and took one step closer to falling in love.  Three years later, we were married.

What was the US civil war about?

Context:

Answer:

The US civil war had a complex start but the main aim was the preservation of slavery for the confederacy and the elimination of slavery for the union. Slavery was the principal political issue between the parties. 
There was also an aspect of the confederacy wanting to secede from the Union to preserve slavery. The union did not want the slave stares to secede. After war broke out, it is interesting to note, no foreign government recognized the confederate government. 
By the mid 1800s, the US had two distinct regions: free states with fast growing economies based on family farming, manufacturing, mining, business and transporting goods. The slave states were based on a plantation system and the only fast growth was in texas. These states were largely rural with few large cities and little industry except in close proximity to free states.

What is the history of Tax Day in the United States?

Context:

Answer:

Tax Day exists as a deadline for many United States residents to report earnings in order to pay income taxes.

The United States introduced the income tax in 1861 in order to fund the American Civil War. This was later deemed unconstitutional and repealed in 1872. This was later reenacted in 1894 as part of the Revenue Act with its constitutionality settled in the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1913. Tax day was initially set for March in 1913 and was eventually moved to April 15th in 1955.

When does tropical cyclone season occur in the Southern Hemisphere?

Context:

Summer is traditionally associated with hot or warm weather. In Mediterranean climates, it is also associated with dry weather, while in other places (particularly in Eastern Asia because of the monsoon) it is associated with rainy weather. The wet season is the main period of vegetation growth within the savanna climate regime. Where the wet season is associated with a seasonal shift in the prevailing winds, it is known as a monsoon.
In the northern Atlantic Ocean, a distinct tropical cyclone season occurs from 1 June to 30 November. The statistical peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is 10 September. The Northeast Pacific Ocean has a broader period of activity, but in a similar timeframe to the Atlantic. The Northwest Pacific sees tropical cyclones year-round, with a minimum in February and March and a peak in early September. In the North Indian basin, storms are most common from April to December, with peaks in May and November. In the Southern Hemisphere, the tropical cyclone season runs from the start of November until the end of April with peaks in mid-February to early March.
Thunderstorm season in the United States and Canada runs in the spring through summer but sometimes can run as late as October or even November in the fall. These storms can produce hail, strong winds and tornadoes, usually during the afternoon and evening.

Answer:

In the Southern Hemisphere, the tropical cyclone season runs from the start of November until the end of April with peaks in mid-February to early March.

<PAD><s> Instruction:

Suggest an allocation to implement a three portfolio strategy as described in the text below

Context:

A three-fund portfolio is based on the fundamental asset classes, stocks and bonds. It is assumed that cash is not counted within the investment portfolio, so it is not included. On the other hand, it is assumed that every investor should hold both domestic and international stocks. The task, then, is to take these three basic non-cash assets — domestic stocks, international stocks, and bonds — decide how much of each to hold (your asset allocation); choose where to hold each of these asset classes, and finally choose a mutual fund to use for each asset class.

Answer:

From Vanguard's list of "core funds," the funds that are best for a three-fund portfolio are:

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX)
Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VTIAX)
Vanguard Total Bond Market Fund (VBTLX)
So, a "three-fund portfolio" might consist of 42% Total Stock Market Index, 18% Total International Stock Index, and 40% Total Bond Market fund.

What is the best way to clean a cast iron pan that is heavily soiled?

Context:

Answer:

Use a scrub brush or scrub sponge, but not one with any kind of metal in it. Contrary to popular opinion, you should be able to use soap if your pan is properly seasoned, because proper seasoning results from polymerization of oils across and to the pan itself, rather than just oil sitting on the surface of the pan. If necessary, you can re-season the pan, but this is usually excessive.

<PAD><s> Instruction:

Given this paragraph, what are the potential advantages or disadvantages of using XGBoost versus a single decision tree?

Context:

While the XGBoost model often achieves higher accuracy than a single decision tree, it sacrifices the intrinsic interpretability of decision trees.  For example, following the path that a decision tree takes to make its decision is trivial and self-explained, but following the paths of hundreds or thousands of trees is much harder. To achieve both performance and interpretability, some model compression techniques allow transforming an XGBoost into a single "born-again" decision tree that approximates the same decision function

Answer:

One advantage of using XGBoost over a single decision tree is that it frequently achieves higher accuracy. One disadvantage is that it sacrifices interpretability because it is much more difficult to follow the path of hundreds or thousands of trees.

What are the seven main islands of Canary Island as per the passage? Display the results in a comma separated format.

Context:

The Canary Islands (/kəˈnɛəri/; Spanish: Canarias, pronounced [kaˈnaɾjas]), also known informally as the Canaries, are a Spanish autonomous community and archipelago in Macaronesia in the Atlantic Ocean. At their closest point to the African mainland, they are 100 kilometres (62 miles) west of Morocco. They are the southernmost of the autonomous communities of Spain. The islands have a population of 2.2 million people and are the most populous special territory of the European Union.

The seven main islands are (from largest to smallest in area) Tenerife, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, La Palma, La Gomera, and El Hierro. The archipelago includes many smaller islands and islets, including La Graciosa, Alegranza, Isla de Lobos, Montaña Clara, Roque del Oeste, and Roque del Este. It also includes a number of rocks, including Garachico and Anaga. In ancient times, the island chain was often referred to as "the Fortunate Isles". The Canary Islands are the southernmost region of Spain, and the largest and most populous archipelago of Macaronesia. Because of their location, the Canary Islands have historically been considered a link between the four continents of Africa, North America, South America, and Europe.

In 2019, the Canary Islands had a population of 2,153,389, with a density of 287.39 inhabitants per km2, making it the eighth most populous autonomous community of Spain. The population is mostly concentrated in the two capital islands: around 43% on the island of Tenerife and 40% on the island of Gran Canaria.

The Canary Islands, especially Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura, and Lanzarote, are a major tourist destination, with over 12 million visitors per year. This is due to their beaches, subtropical climate, and important natural attractions, especially Maspalomas in Gran Canaria and Mount Teide (a World Heritage Site) in Tenerife. Mount Teide is the highest peak in Spain and the third tallest volcano in the world, measured from its base on the ocean floor. The islands have warm summers and winters warm enough for the climate to be technically tropical at sea level. The amount of precipitation and the level of maritime moderation vary depending on location and elevation. The archipelago includes green areas as well as desert. The islands' high mountains are ideal for astronomical observation, because they lie above the temperature inversion layer. As a result, the archipelago boasts two professional observatories: the Teide Observatory on Tenerife, and Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma.

Answer:

Tenerife, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, La Palma, La Gomera, El Hierro

Which programming languages did Netscape try to add to their browser in order to make it more dynamic?

Context:

The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web. The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.

During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.

Answer:

The programming languages Netscape tried to add to their browser to make it more dynamic were Java and Scheme.

In 1995, Netscape pursued two routes to add dynamic behavior to their browser, Netscape Navigator:
1. Collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language
2. Hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language

From the passage provided, list the partners with whom Martina Hingis won the doubles Grand Slam in 1998

Context:

In 1998, Hingis won all four of the Grand Slam women's doubles titles, only the fourth in women's tennis history to do so, (the Australian Open with Mirjana Lučić and the other three events with Novotná), and she became only the third woman to hold the No. 1 ranking in both singles and doubles simultaneously. She also retained her Australian Open singles title by beating Conchita Martínez in straight sets in the final. Hingis, however, lost in the final of the US Open to Lindsay Davenport. Davenport ended an 80-week stretch Hingis had enjoyed as the No. 1 singles player in October 1998, but Hingis finished the year by beating Davenport in the final of the WTA Tour Championships.

Given this paragraph about skydiving, give me the average time skydiver spends in freefall.

Context:

Skydiving includes free falling (usually from an airplane) through the air prior to opening a parachute. Typically skydives are carried out from around 4,000m (or 12,500ft) offering 40 to 50 seconds of freefall time. Longer free fall times can be achieved by exiting an aircraft at altitudes much higher than 4,000m, but very high jumps require pressurized air within the aircraft, and bottled oxygen for the diver.

Answer:

Typically skydives are carried out from around 4,000m (or 12,500ft) offering 40 to 50 seconds of freefall time.

In what ways can having children improve your quality of life?

Context:

Answer:

This is my own opinion, and completely anecdotal, but having children can help improve your quality of life in several ways. Children can provide parents a sense of purpose. Parents are responsible for the well-being of their children, and this obligation in-turn forces parents to become less self-centered, and focus on something other than themselves. The relationships parents develop with their children is also unique to any other bond. They represent a piece of you, and are completely dependent on your for everything. That dependence, when coupled with the love they have for you, can give your life new meaning and joy.

Without quoting directly from the text, give me a summary of the Voyager 1 space mission

Context:

Voyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA on September 5, 1977, as part of the Voyager program to study the outer Solar System and interstellar space beyond the Sun's heliosphere. Launched 16 days after its twin Voyager 2, Voyager 1 has been operating for 45 years, 7 months and 1 day as of April 6, 2023 UTC . It communicates through NASA's Deep Space Network to receive routine commands and to transmit data to Earth. Real-time distance and velocity data is provided by NASA and JPL. At a distance of 159.20 AU (23.816 billion km; 14.799 billion mi) from Earth as of March 27, 2023, it is the most distant human-made object from Earth.

The probe made flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn's largest moon, Titan. NASA had a choice of either doing a Pluto or Titan flyby; exploration of the moon took priority because it was known to have a substantial atmosphere. Voyager 1 studied the weather, magnetic fields, and rings of the two gas giants and was the first probe to provide detailed images of their moons.

As part of the Voyager program and like its sister craft Voyager 2, the spacecraft's extended mission is to locate and study the regions and boundaries of the outer heliosphere and to begin exploring the interstellar medium. Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause and entered interstellar space on August 25, 2012, making it the first spacecraft to do so. Two years later, Voyager 1 began experiencing a third "tsunami wave" of coronal mass ejections from the Sun that continued to at least December 15, 2014, further confirming that the probe is indeed in interstellar space.

In a further testament to the robustness of Voyager 1, the Voyager team tested the spacecraft's trajectory correction maneuver (TCM) thrusters in late 2017 (the first time these thrusters had been fired since 1980), a project enabling the mission to be extended by two to three years. Voyager 1's extended mission is expected to continue until about 2025, when its radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) will no longer supply enough electric power to operate its scientific instruments.

Answer:

The Voyager 1 space mission began on September 5, 1977 when the probe was launched with mission parameters to explore out solar system, planets, and outer solar system beyond the sun.  The mission is currently in it's 45th year and has provided significant learning about the atmosphere of planets like Jupiter and Saturn, while continuing to scientific data on regions of space never before encountered.

Given this text give me short summary about Beavers

Context:

Beavers (genus Castor) are large, semiaquatic rodents of the Northern Hemisphere. There are two existing species: the North American beaver (Castor canadensis) and the Eurasian beaver (C. fiber). Beavers are the second-largest living rodents, after capybaras, weighing up to 30 kilograms (66 lb). Beavers have stout bodies with large heads, long chisel-like incisors, brown or gray fur, hand-like front feet, webbed back feet, and tails that are flat and scaly. The two species differ in skull and tail shape and fur color. Beavers can be found in a number of freshwater habitats, such as rivers, streams, lakes and ponds. They are herbivorous, consuming tree bark, aquatic plants, grasses and sedges.

Answer:

Here is a short summary about Beavers:
There are two existing species - North American and Eurasian.
They are the second-largest living rodents. 
Physically species of Beaver can vary in terms of fur colour but they all have webbed back feet, hand-like front feet and flat scaly tails. Long chisel-like incisors are a key feature. 
Beavers can be found in freshwater habits. 
They are herbivores.

What are the places McCaw travelled to capture movements of the Sun?
List them in a comma separated format.

Context:

McCaw was born in Daly City, California, in 1971. He has a BFA from the Academy of Art College in San Francisco.

McCaw is known for his large-format homemade cameras in which he uses expired gelatin silver photo paper and long exposures to make solarized paper negatives which often include the burned path of the sun within the frame, in a series named Sunburn. McCaw travels to remote places to capture different apparent movements of the sun, including the Arctic Circle in Alaska, the Galápagos Islands and the Mojave Desert. McCaw's earlier work used a 7×17 inch view camera to create large-format negatives from which he made platinum prints. Projects following Sunburn include work with a modified Cirkut camera, resulting in exposures that can take more than 24 hours. A series titled Poli-optic employs a homemade camera with a grid of lenses. Finally, the series Heliograph includes work in which there are multiple exposures of the sun on the same paper negative.

Answer:

Arctic Circle in Alaska, the Galápagos Islands, the Mojave Desert.

What were gulags and who lived in them?

Context:

The Gulag was the government agency in charge of the Soviet network of forced labour camps which were set up by order of Vladimir Lenin, reaching its peak during Joseph Stalin's rule from the 1930s to the early 1950s. English-language speakers also use the word gulag in reference to each of the forced-labor camps that existed in the Soviet Union, including the camps that existed in the post-Lenin era. The full official name of the agency changed several times.

The Gulag is recognized as a major instrument of political repression in the Soviet Union. The camps housed a wide range of convicts, from petty criminals to political prisoners, a large number of whom were convicted by simplified procedures, such as NKVD troikas or other instruments of extrajudicial punishment. In 1918–1922, the agency was administered by the Cheka, followed by the GPU (1922–1923), the OGPU (1923–1934), later known as the NKVD (1934–1946), and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) in the final years. The Solovki prison camp, the first correctional labour camp which was constructed after the revolution, was opened in 1918 and legalized by a decree, "On the creation of the forced-labor camps", on April 15, 1919.

Answer:

Gulags were forced labour camps created during the Soviet Union that were used as an instrument of political repression and punishment. Gulags housed a wide range of individuals, from political prisoners to petty criminals.

<PAD><s> Instruction:

Why is job training such as upskilling and reskilling so important?

Context:

Answer:

The degree of importance of job training differs based on the government as job training is much more important in a capitalist economy versus a communist economy.  Assuming a capitalist economy, job training is important because of market dynamics, supply and demand.  In this case, demand are the available jobs and supply are the skilled workers who provide work in those jobs.  As technology advances, new innovations are made and cyclical market segments ebb and flow, the demand for highly skilled workers changes.  Upskilling is important as it helps workers to maintain valuable skills in their given field and the goal is to keep up with the technology advances in their respective field.  Reskilling is most often more closely linked to cyclical market forces where the demand for jobs in one field go down and another go up; reskilling is acquiring skills in the field with growing demand for jobs when a worker possesses skills in a field with declining demand for jobs or their skills.

Given these paragraphs about Large language models, what are relevant dimensions influencing the skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable?

Context:

A large language model (LLM) is a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabelled text using self-supervised learning. LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.

Properties
Though the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.

Though trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to "memorize" a great quantity of facts during training.

Hallucinations
Main article: Hallucination (artificial intelligence)
In artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular, a "hallucination" is a confident response that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data.

Emergent abilities

On a number of natural language benchmarks involving tasks such as question answering, models perform no better than random chance until they reach a certain scale (in this case, measured by training computation), at which point their performance sharply increases. These are examples of emergent abilities.
Unpredictable abilities that have been observed in large language models but that were not present in simpler models (and that were not explicitly designed into the model) are usually called "emergent abilities". Researchers note that such abilities "cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models". These abilities are discovered rather than programmed-in or designed, in some cases only after the LLM has been publicly deployed. Hundreds of emergent abilities have been described. Examples include multi-step arithmetic, taking college-level exams, identifying the intended meaning of a word, chain-of-thought prompting, decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet, unscrambling a word’s letters, identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.

Architecture and training
Large language models have most commonly used the transformer architecture, which, since 2018, has become the standard deep learning technique for sequential data (previously, recurrent architectures such as the LSTM were most common). LLMs are trained in an unsupervised manner on unannotated text. A left-to-right transformer is trained to maximize the probability assigned to the next word in the training data, given the previous context. Alternatively, an LLM may use a bidirectional transformer (as in the example of BERT), which assigns a probability distribution over words given access to both preceding and following context. In addition to the task of predicting the next word or "filling in the blanks", LLMs may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear side-by-side in the training corpus.

The earliest LLMs were trained on corpora having on the order of billions of words. The first model in OpenAI's GPT series was trained in 2018 on BookCorpus, consisting of 985 million words. In the same year, BERT was trained on a combination of BookCorpus and English Wikipedia, totalling 3.3 billion words. In the years since then, training corpora for LLMs have increased by orders of magnitude, reaching up to hundreds of billions or trillions of tokens.

LLMs are computationally expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated the cost of training a 1.5 billion parameter model (1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the state of the art at the time) at $1.6 million.

A 2020 analysis found that neural language models' capability (as measured by training loss) increased smoothly in a power law relationship with number of parameters, quantity of training data, and computation used for training. These relationships were tested over a wide range of values (up to seven orders of magnitude) and no attenuation of the relationship was observed at the highest end of the range (including for network sizes up to trillions of parameters).

Application to downstream tasks
Between 2018 and 2020, the standard method for harnessing an LLM for a specific natural language processing (NLP) task was to fine tune the model with additional task-specific training. It has subsequently been found that more powerful LLMs such as GPT-3 can solve tasks without additional training via "prompting" techniques, in which the problem to be solved is presented to the model as a text prompt, possibly with some textual examples of similar problems and their solutions.

Fine-tuning
Main article: Fine-tuning (machine learning)
Fine-tuning is the practice of modifying an existing pretrained language model by training it (in a supervised fashion) on a specific task (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging). It is a form of transfer learning. It generally involves the introduction of a new set of weights connecting the final layer of the language model to the output of the downstream task. The original weights of the language model may be "frozen", such that only the new layer of weights connecting them to the output are learned during training. Alternatively, the original weights may receive small updates (possibly with earlier layers frozen).

Prompting
See also: Prompt engineering and Few-shot learning (natural language processing)
In the prompting paradigm, popularized by GPT-3, the problem to be solved is formulated via a text prompt, which the model must solve by providing a completion (via inference). In "few-shot prompting", the prompt includes a small number of examples of similar (problem, solution) pairs. For example, a sentiment analysis task of labelling the sentiment of a movie review could be prompted as follows:

Review: This movie stinks.
Sentiment: negative

Review: This movie is fantastic!
Sentiment:

If the model outputs "positive", then it has correctly solved the task. In zero-shot prompting, no solve examples are provided. An example of a zero-shot prompt for the same sentiment analysis task would be "The sentiment associated with the movie review 'This movie is fantastic!' is".

Few-shot performance of LLMs has been shown to achieve competitive results on NLP tasks, sometimes surpassing prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Examples of such NLP tasks are translation, question answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, and using a novel word in a sentence. The creation and optimisation of such prompts is called prompt engineering.

Instruction tuning
Instruction tuning is a form of fine-tuning designed to facilitate more natural and accurate zero-shot prompting interactions. Given a text input, a pretrained language model will generate a completion which matches the distribution of text on which it was trained. A naive language model given the prompt "Write an essay about the main themes of Hamlet." might provide a completion such as "A late penalty of 10% per day will be applied to submissions received after March 17." In instruction tuning, the language model is trained on many examples of tasks formulated as natural language instructions, along with appropriate responses. Various techniques for instruction tuning have been applied in practice. OpenAI's InstructGPT protocol involves supervised fine-tuning on a dataset of human-generated (prompt, response) pairs, followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in which a reward function was learned based on a dataset of human preferences. Another technique, "self-instruct", fine-tunes the language model on a training set of examples which are themselves generated by an LLM (bootstrapped from a small initial set of human-generated examples).

Given a reference text that provides the geographical description of continent Asia, how many Asian countries have a part of their land in Europe as well?

Context:

Asia is the largest continent on Earth. It covers 9% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the longest coastline, at 62,800 kilometres (39,022 mi). Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of Eurasia. It is located to the east of the Suez Canal and the Ural Mountains, and south of the Caucasus Mountains (or the Kuma–Manych Depression) and the Caspian and Black Seas. It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. Asia is subdivided into 49 countries, five of them (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey) are transcontinental countries lying partly in Europe. Geographically, Russia is partly in Asia, but is considered a European nation, both culturally and politically.

Instruction:

What is Cincinnati style chili?

Context:

Cincinnati chili (or Cincinnati-style chili) is a Mediterranean-spiced meat sauce used as a topping for spaghetti or hot dogs ("coneys"); both dishes were developed by immigrant restaurateurs in the 1920s. In 2013, Smithsonian named one local chili parlor one of the "20 Most Iconic Food Destinations in America". Its name evokes comparison to chili con carne, but the two are dissimilar in consistency, flavor, and serving method; Cincinnati chili more closely resembles Greek pasta sauces and spiced-meat hot dog topping sauces seen in other parts of the United States.

Ingredients include ground beef, water or stock, tomato paste, spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, clove, cumin, chili powder, bay leaf, and in some home recipes unsweetened dark chocolate in a soupy consistency. Customary toppings include cheddar cheese, onions, and beans; specific combinations of toppings are known as "ways". The most popular order is a "three-way", which adds shredded cheese to the chili-topped spaghetti (a "two-way"), while a "four-way" or "five-way" adds onions and/or beans before topping with the cheese. Ways are often served with oyster crackers and a mild hot sauce. Cincinnati chili is almost never served or eaten by the bowl.

While served in many local restaurants, it is most often associated with the over 250 independent and chain "chili parlors" (restaurants specializing in Cincinnati chili) found throughout greater Cincinnati with franchise locations throughout Ohio and in Kentucky, Indiana, Florida, and the Middle East. The dish is the Cincinnati area's best-known regional food.

Answer:

Cincinnati chili is a cinnamon and nutmeg flavored meat sauce with a soupy consistency, that is served over plain spaghetti noodles with optional toppings of shredded cheddar, diced white onion, and/or kidney beans, and a side of oyster crackers.   It is also served on top of mini hotdogs known as "coneys."  The way to order like a native is to describe your order as a "three-way," "four-way," or "five-way" the number reflecting the additional toppings desired.  For example, "four-way bean" is a platter of spaghetti with meat sauce, cheese and kidney beans, whereas a "three-way" is spaghetti, meat sauce and cheese only.  A 'five way" is everything - spaghetti, meat sauce, cheese, beans, and diced onion.

What kind of merchant ships would be useful in a modern naval conflict?

Context:

Answer:

Two broad categories of merchant ships would likely be most useful in a modern naval conflict: large roll-on/roll-off ships with double hulls and small, fast ferries. If an adversary can find a ship on the open ocean and target it with a modern anti-ship missile, this opponent can certainly destroy the complex machinery needed to operate a container port or an oil terminal. Consequently, any cargo you want to unload in a war zone is going to need to drive off a ship on the back of a truck....quickly. An oil tanker will be useless, but a RO/RO ship loaded with tanker trucks can unload lots of fuel under austere/wartime conditions. Similarly, a container ship will be of little use without the large, land-based cranes used at most container shipping ports. A ferry loaded with trucks hauling shipping containers can quickly load and unload without the need for specialized equipment. Data from the Iran-Iraq war suggest that a large, 50,000+ ton RO/RO with a double hull is likely big enough to survive a hit from a modern anti-ship missile. A fast ferry that can move at ~40 knots is probably going to be too small to detect from space or shore using backscatter radar. Conversely, a 100,000-ton PanMax oil tanker or a 5,000 TEU container ship will be easy to detect, and slow enough to target.

Why are cats so picky about what they eat?

Context:

Cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans (470 or so versus more than 9,000 on the human tongue). Domestic and wild cats share a taste receptor gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness. Their taste buds instead respond to acids, amino acids like protein, and bitter tastes. Cats also have a distinct temperature preference for their food, preferring food with a temperature around 38 °C (100 °F) which is similar to that of a fresh kill and routinely rejecting food presented cold or refrigerated (which would signal to the cat that the "prey" item is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or decomposing).

Answer:

Cats' taste buds respond to acids, protein, and bitter tastes. The taste buds do not respond to sweetness. Additionally, cats prefer food with a temperature near 100 °F (38 °C). For wild cats, this temperature is associated with fresh food as opposed to food that may be decomposing.

What foods are good sources of protein?

Context:

Answer:

Protein is essential for body function and is great for repairing and building muscles in your body. Eggs, chicken breast, and lean beef all have a lot of protein. So do dairy items like greek yogurt, cottage cheese, and milk. Vegetarians can find high protein in legumes like lentils, black beans, and chickpeas.

If you find you aren't getting enough protein in your daily diet, consider getting a protein supplement and adding it to smoothies.

Instruction:

Discuss at least two risks associated with scraping data from websites. Describe steps an analyst could take to mitigate those risks.

Context:

Answer:

No clear Terms-of-service for scrapping the B2B partnership data 

The companies like Hubspot (https://legal.hubspot.com/website-terms-of-use) and Salesforce do not have a clear Terms of Service (TOS) when using partnership data. The TOS is subject to interpretation. 

Automation is highly fragile 

Web-scrapping the B2B partnership data with an automated scrapping tool or a programming language like Python- BeautifulSoup is a highly fragile process. The website layout, which can be dynamically changing, can break the automated scraping. Even with automatic scrapping, there will be many manual activities to normalize the data. 

An analyst could list the top companies for B2B partnerships and request the companies for the B2B data. The analyst can start approaching the smaller companies and build the business model to illustrate the value of sharing B2B data, creating a flywheel where more companies will be willing to share the data.

Should I take extra fuel when traveling to Alaska?

Context:

Answer:

There are limited roads in Alaska, as well as northern Canada. While there are some gas stops along the way, options are limited and you might run out of gas in the wilderness. As Alaska is an extremely large state, being stranded in the middle of nowhere is potentially very harmful. It’s a very good idea to take extra fuel when taking a road trip to or through Alaska. Make sure you buy a proper gas can that will not dissolve when in contact with gasoline or diesel.

How did Kdramas become so popular?

Context:

Answer:

Korean dramas or Kdramas have been popular for over 2 decades now. However, the rise in popularity shot up during the pandemic. Kdramas were initially watched by people in Southeast Asian countries and in some places in South Asia. When the pandemic hit, a lot of Kdramas were available on Netflix making it easier for people to watch them. With word of mouth, this soon spread and more and more users were watching Kdramas. Netflix took advantage of this viewership and started making dramas of their own or buying rights for dramas to be streaming exclusively on Netflix. This soon led to Disney and other platforms making dramas of their own. Kpop has also helped in attracting viewers. Whether it's the captivating story plot, the acting, actors or action, the Hallyu wave has spread throughout the world.

Based on the reference text, what does the champion of the Masters Tournament receive?

Context:

The Masters Tournament
The tournament has a number of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless they need to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Lee Elder, and Tom Watson. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.

Answer:

The champion of the Masters Tournament receives a green jacket. However, it must be returned to the clubhouse the following year to be stored in a designated cloakroom.

<s> Instruction:

What are the unethical behaviors in the corporate world? Illustrate with an example.

Context:

Answer:

Boeing 737 Max 

 
Boeing is an American multinational company that manufactures aircraft, military equipment, rockets, missiles, and telecommunication equipment. The Boeing 737 series aircraft is the most popular commercial jet in the world. In March 2019 and December 2020, the Boeing 737 Max commercial jets belonging to Ethiopian and LION Air crashed, grounding the 737 Max jets. These incidents triggered the crisis at Boeing. 

The Boeing 737 Max crisis is a classic example of chained unethical behaviors exhibited by an organization and how one unethical behavior quickly led to another in an attempt to cover up the previous one. 

Motivated blindness 

Motivated blindness was the initial cause for the people involved in the 737 Max jet design. It started with Boeing’s chief technical test pilot, David Forkner, who repeatedly spotted erratic behavior on the jets MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System). Despite egregious MCAS, David later urged FAA (Federal Aviation Authority) to remove the MCAS mentioned from the 737 Max instruction manual. Boeing management failed to overlook David ForKner’s and other faults and chose to remain ignorant. 

Indirect blindness 

Similarly, a lot is afoul with FAA. Months before the crash of 2 jets, Boeing had known about the issues and delayed the flight data submission to FAA. Despite the warnings from FAA, Boeing got away with it quickly. The indirect blindness of the FAA added insult to injury to the crisis. 

Slippery slope 

Boeing was on a slippery slope, and the downward spiral continued with David Forkner requesting FAA to remove the mentions of MCAS from the jet’s instruction manual. Another test pilot, Gustavsson, claimed that David Forkner kept him out of the loop. 
 
Overvaluing outcomes 

On the whole, Boeing was unaware of the looming crisis and, at every stage, was overvaluing the outcomes of getting the jet out of the production lines and getting it FAA-approved. 

Recommendations 

 The managers at Boeing must implement processes that root out conflicts of interest. For example, when David Forkner captured the erratic behavior of MCAS, the stringent process to capture test data and the data must be published to a governance board to resolve any conflict of interest. 

Similarly, for FAA-related transactions and interactions, the governance board must oversee whether the transactions might invite unethical behavior and take ownership of the implications. 

Boeing’s governance board must continuously monitor for trivial ethical infractions and address them immediately. It has to examine both “good” and “bad” decisions for their ethical implications.

Best way to buy a new or used car?

Context:

Answer:

Before you visit a dealership, get financing from your bank so that you have leverage at the dealership and can compare interest rates. Do research online to identify cars you would like to see in person. The more you look online, the more you will understand pricing, incentives, and upgrades available. Line up a few options that you would like to see in person. Always test drive any car you are considering. Know before you go to the dealership how much you want to offer for the car you like. If the dealership does not accept the offer, be willing to walk out and onto the next car. Do not let the dealership force you into optional packages or services you do not want. They can not force you to buy the extras. You will get the best deal if you are patient and do your research to know when you find a good deal.

How can I be more productive?

Context:

Answer:

The best way to be productive is to starting "doing" rather than "thinking"
* Set small goals
* Reward yourself for completing those small goals, small rewards like taking a break, eating your favourite snack, spending time with your kid.
* Do not multi-task because we really can not.
* Create a list of things to do and strike it off one by one. Do not get overwhelmed by the list. 
* If you can delegate something do that, but make sure to follow up.
* Actually there is a course by David Allen on LinkedIn Learning or you can also read his book "Getting Things Done" it tells you about a 5 step process. Capture , Clarify, Organize, Review, Engage. 
* And anything that can be done in 2 minutes, just finish it off. 

Starting with one small thing, will make you productive. It is like a dominos, you change one keystone habit and it changes all the others eventually.

How to introduce a new cat to the household if you already have cats?

Context:

Answer:

Confine the new cat to a single room. Make sure the confined cat have access to everything he or she needs, including water, food, bedding, litterbox and toys. Feed your new and existing cats across the closed door, so that the cats can smell each other and associate each other's presence with food and happiness. Use synthetic feline facial pheromone in both the new cat’s room and in the area where the resident cat spends the most time will help to create feelings of familiarity and security within the physical environment. After a while, exchange pieces of bedding between the resident cats and the new cat so that the cats start to recognize each others scents. Slowly allow cats to interact with each other under supervision to ensure the cats build early positive experiences together.

What is the difference between coffee and espresso?

Context:

Answer:

Espresso is a type of coffee. More specifically, it's a method of brewing coffee that uses high water pressure and finely ground beans to make a small, concentrated shot. Espresso has a top layer of foam known as the crema, which is a by-product of the high-pressure extraction process.

When ordering a "coffee" in America, you will most likely get a drip coffee which is also a type of coffee. When you order un caffè (a coffee) in Italy, you will most likely receive an espresso.

<s> Instruction:

Given this paragraph about bicycle manufacturer Colnago, what Italian automobile company did Colnago work with to develop new carbon fiber technology?

Context:

Since the 1980s, while Colnago continued to produce high-end steel bikes, they began to produce cycle frames using material other than steel, including titanium, aluminum, carbon fiber and mixed materials. One unique frame from this period, the Bititan, has a dual titanium down tube. Crimped and oversize tubes were used on the Tecnos–one of the lightest production steel bikes produced. Similarly crimped oversized aluminum tubes were used on the Dream frame. In 1981 Colnago prototyped the CX Pista–a full monocoque carbon fiber cycle with disc wheels, which was shown at the Milan bike show. Subsequently, Colnago worked with Ferrari to develop new carbon fiber technology, and Ernesto also credits their engineers for challenging him regarding fork design, which led to Colnago's innovative Precisa straight-bladed steel fork (1987). Colnago also experimented with multi-material frames, including the CT-1 and CT-2 constructed with titanium main tubes, carbon fiber forks and rear stays, and a similarly constructed (although short-lived) Master frame constructed with steel main tubes, carbon forks and stays.

Answer:

Colnago worked with Ferrari to develop new carbon fiber technology.

Are there any eco-friendly alternatives to cremation?

Context:

Answer:

Water cremation, also know as Aquamation or alkaline hydrolysis,  is an eco-friendly alternative to cremation.  It involves a gentle process where the body of the deceased is reduced to ashes using water.  Aquamation preserves over 90% of energy as opposed to flame-based cremation.  Most people find this new technique to be more comforting as water is often associated with grown and new life.  Many pet owners are choosing this method for their beloved companions as another benefit of Aquamation is that owners are able to retain more of their pets ashes due to the omission of flames as way to reduce bone into ash.

<s> Instruction:

Will, a 45-yr-old former collegiate swimmer turned lifelong triathlete, requests assistance with run training. His only significant medical history is a series of overuse injuries to his shoulders and Achilles tendon. In recent weeks, he notes his workouts are unusually difficult and reports feeling constriction in his chest with exertion – something he attributes to deficiencies in core strength. Upon further questioning, he explains that the chest constriction is improved with rest and that he often feels dizzy during recovery. What do you think is the underlying problem that could be causing Will’s symptoms during/after exercise?

Context:

Answer:

Will probably has some form of  cardiovascular disease (CVD). As he was a collegiate athlete and now triathlete, he has undergone many years of intense exercise training, which could induce pathological cardiac remodeling, ultimately leading to myocardial fibrosis. This form of CVD can be common among trained athletes, particularly endurance athletes such as Will (swimming, triathlon).

According to the passage, mention some of Taylor’s hit songs after signing for Republic records.

Context:

Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her genre-spanning discography, songwriting abilities and artistic reinventions have received critical praise and wide media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country artist to write a U.S. platinum-certified album.
Swift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" were the first country songs to top the U.S. pop and all-genre airplay charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", and eschewed her country image in her synth-pop album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do".
Exiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She ventured into indie folk and alternative rock in her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, whose singles "Cardigan" and "Willow" topped the Hot 100. Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over their masters, re-releasing two in 2021—Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version). The latter's "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Her 2022 album Midnights and single "Anti-Hero" broke all-time streaming records. Swift has directed music videos and films, such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and played supporting roles in others.
Having sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians in history. She is the most streamed woman on Spotify and the only act to have five albums open with over one million copies sold in the US. Among her accolades are 12 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; an Emmy Award; 40 American Music Awards; 29 Billboard Music Awards; three IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards; and 92 Guinness World Records. Swift has been featured in rankings such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100. Honored with titles such as Artist of the Decade and Woman of the Decade, Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and women's empowerment. Her music is credited with influencing a generation of singers and songwriters.

<s> Instruction:

Create a dialogue between two characters discussing the impact of social media on their lives. Your dialogue should explore both the positive and negative effects of social media on society.

Context:

Answer:

Person 1 (P1): I feel so anxious nowadays. Especially, when I open these social media apps.
Person 2 (P2): Oh no, I am sorry to hear. I actually really enjoy these apps. They help me destress.
P1: That is nice. I am glad it is working for you. I wonder if I am unable to cancel all this noise and the endless pressure does not help. I find myself comparing with other people on the platform; how they are vacationing while I am grinding at work or how they are able to run marathons and do pull ups while I am struggling to even climb 10 stairs
P2: That is so true. I remember having this conversation with a friend of mine a few months ago. Then I figured, if I can follow pages that makes me feel good and if I interact with those pages more.. my feed will improve. It has worked well for me. You can actually use these platforms to keep yourself motivated.
P1: That sounds motivating. I fear I might waste a lot of time on these.
P2: That is a valid concern. I set up app timers to ensure I am not on it more than 20 minutes. May be try that?
P2: I will try that!

Instruction:

Extract the names of the ramen. separate them with comma.

Context:

Shio (塩, 'salt') ramen is the oldest of the four types. It has a pale, clear, yellowish broth made with plenty of salt and any combination of chicken, vegetables, fish, and seaweed. Occasionally pork bones are also used, but they are not boiled as long as they are for tonkotsu ramen, so the soup remains light and clear. Chāshū is sometimes swapped for lean chicken meatballs, and pickled plums and kamaboko (a slice of processed fish roll sometimes served as a frilly white circle with a pink or red spiral called narutomaki) are popular toppings as well. Noodle texture and thickness varies among shio ramen, but they are usually straight rather than curly. Hakodate ramen is a well-known version of shio ramen in Japan.
Shōyu (醤油, 'soy sauce') ramen has a clear brown broth, based on a chicken and vegetable (or sometimes fish or beef) stock with plenty of soy sauce added resulting in a soup that is tangy, salty, and savory yet still fairly light on the palate. Shōyu ramen usually has curly noodles rather than straight ones, although this is not always the case. It is often adorned with marinated bamboo shoots or menma, scallions, ninjin ('carrot'), kamaboko ('fish cakes'), nori ('seaweed'), boiled eggs, bean sprouts or black pepper; occasionally the soup will also contain chili oil or Chinese spices, and some shops serve sliced beef instead of the usual chāshū.
Miso (味噌) ramen reached national prominence around 1965. This uniquely Japanese ramen, which was developed in Sapporo Hokkaido, features a broth that combines copious miso and is blended with oily chicken or fish broth – and sometimes with tonkotsu or lard – to create a thick, nutty, slightly sweet and very hearty soup. Miso ramen broth tends to have a robust, tangy flavor, so it stands up to a variety of flavorful toppings: spicy bean paste or tōbanjan (豆瓣醤), butter and corn, leeks, onions, bean sprouts, ground pork, cabbage, sesame seeds, white pepper, chilli and chopped garlic are common. The noodles are typically thick, curly, and slightly chewy.
Karē (カレー, 'curry') ramen is a relative newcomer, cooked with curry soup. In Japan, several cities claim to be its place of origin. The city of Muroran claims it originated there in 1965 (see also Muroran curry ramen), while the city of Sanjō claims to have had karē ramen for over 80 years, and the city of Katori also claims to have been the site of its origin. Curry soup is mainly made with pork bones and vegetables and is seasoned with curry. The noodles are thick and curly. Toppings include chāshū, wakame, and bean sprouts.

Shio, Shoyu, Miso, Kare

Why is Dunkin' Donuts so popular?

Context:

Answer:

Dunkin Donuts is a coffee and donut franchise with particularly high concentration in the Northeast United States, which is colloquially referred to as New England. Although the quality of the coffee is mediocre and the donuts tend to taste like plastic, Dunkin' Donuts (now re-branded as Dunkin') carries a special place in the heart of many New Englanders. 

Perhaps it's the the fact that you are rarely more than 10 miles away from a Dunkin' franchise at any given time, or perhaps it is their blatant obsession with New England professional sports teams. Either way, Dunkin' has established itself as a household name and weekday staple for many coffee drinkers in the frigid Northeast.

What are the key elements of a sauna?

Context:

Answer:

Saunas are a room with a heat source that will hold room temperature between 150 and 220 degrees Fahrenheit. The heat source is electric or wood fire. Typically saunas have an 8’ ceiling, and the size of the room is optimized for the number of people that are expected to use it concurrently. Saunas also need benches. The optimal bench depth is 24” to allow users to lay down comfortably. Bench and wall paneling is typically western red cedar, although other wood types that can withstand high swings in temperature are suitable as well. Proper wall, ceiling, and even floor insulation is critical, and given there will be water vapor in the room, there needs to be a vapor barrier between the wall panels and insulation. A floor drain is also highly encouraged.

He is Director of the Neurosurgical Spine Program at Johns Hopkins and Co-Director of the Carnegie Center for Surgical Innovation at Johns Hopkins.

Dr. Theodore graduated from Cornell University, where he was the recipient of a Cornell Tradition Academic Fellowship. He attended medical school at Georgetown University, where he graduated with honors. After completing his internship at Bethesda Naval Hospital, Dr. Theodore served as a Senior General Medical Officer with the United States Marine Corps in Okinawa, Japan.

Dr. Theodore completed his neurosurgical residency and a fellowship in spinal surgery at the Barrow Neurological Institute. After completing his residency in 2001, he served as Chief of the Division of Neurosurgery at Naval Medical Center San Diego, overseeing the largest neurosurgery complement in the Navy.

In 2003, Dr. Theodore joined the faculty at the Barrow Neurological Institute, and assumed the position of Director of Neurotrauma. In 2004 he was appointed Associate Director of the Neurosurgery Residency Program at Barrow. The Neurosurgery Residency Program at Barrow is the largest in the United States, training four residents per academic year, for a total of 28 residents.

Can you give me a brief history of Data Storage?

Context:

Answer:

In 1725, Basile Bouchon invented punch cards, which communicate information in a machine language. The punched holes communicated a sequence of instructions and acted as on/off switches for devices such as self-playing pianos or looms. About a century later, Charles Babbage invented the first mechanical calculator, the Difference Engine using punch card instructions. Herman Hollerith continued developing this idea and made the Analytical Engine a reality by using punch holes to be a sequence of instructions and also store the instruction data on the device. In 1890, he developed a punch card data processing system for the US Census and went on to form the Tabulating Machine Company in 1896, later renamed International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). By the 1950s punch cards were being used regularly by the US government and industry.  Even today, punch cards are still used in standardized tests and voting ballots. Initially invented by Fritz Pfleumer in 1928, magnetic storage gradually replaced punch cards in the 1960s.  By 1965, Mohawk Data Sciences Corporation sold a key-to-tape magnetic tape device that was specifically marketed to replace the punch card. Cassette tapes started to become commonly used for most computers in the 70s and 80s. Fast forward to the 90s, affordable personal computers and magnetic disk storage replaced almost all punch card devices.

How are weather forecasts created?

Context:

Answer:

Weather forecasts are created by combining data from many sources, such as satellites, weather balloons, and ground stations.  Those data points are then fed to large computer systems with sophisticated models to predict how the weather will change over time.  

Weather sites and even local weather forecasters use this information to provide a regional and short-term forecasts.

<PAD><s> Instruction:

Explain me the concept of "Karma" in Buddhism.

Context:

Answer:

Karma is one of the most misunderstood aspects of Buddhism. In simple terms, Karma is the law of action and reactions. Our actions, both physical and thoughts, are the acts that are put in the world. Reactions can be referred to as their manifestations in the actor's life, i.e. our own life. For example, suppose your mind is filled with greed, evil thoughts like harming another person, and jealousy. In that case, it reflects restlessness as we will never be satisfied, punishments for harming another person, and stress to become like someone else, respectively. For a positive example, a life lived with generosity, righteousness, kindness, and genuinely putting good out there will lead to respect in society and a fulfilled life. Furthermore, Buddhism believes in reincarnation. So the good acts and deeds that one puts in this life, one also reaps the benefits in the next life. Therefore, the equation of Karma is relatively straightforward. Do good and work for the betterment of society and oneself.

History of the Arches National Park creation.

Context:

Humans have occupied the region since the last ice age 10,000 years ago. Fremont people and Ancestral Puebloans lived in the area until about 700 years ago. Spanish missionaries encountered Ute and Paiute tribes in the area when they first came through in 1775, but the first European-Americans to attempt settlement in the area were the Mormon Elk Mountain Mission in 1855, who soon abandoned the area. Ranchers, farmers, and prospectors later settled Moab in the neighboring Riverine Valley in the late 1870s. Word of the beauty of the surrounding rock formations spread beyond the settlement as a possible tourist destination.

The Arches area was first brought to the attention of the National Park Service by Frank A. Wadleigh, passenger traffic manager of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad. Wadleigh, accompanied by railroad photographer George L. Beam, visited the area in September 1923 at the invitation of Alexander Ringhoffer, a Hungarian-born prospector living in Salt Valley. Ringhoffer had written to the railroad to interest them in the tourist potential of a scenic area he had discovered the previous year with his two sons and a son-in-law, which he called the Devils Garden (known today as the Klondike Bluffs). Wadleigh was impressed by what Ringhoffer showed him, and suggested to Park Service director Stephen T. Mather that the area be made a national monument.

The following year, additional support for the monument idea came from Laurence Gould, a University of Michigan graduate student (and future polar explorer) studying the geology of the nearby La Sal Mountains, who was shown the scenic area by local physician Dr. J. W. "Doc" Williams.

A succession of government investigators examined the area, in part due to confusion as to the precise location. In the process, the name Devils Garden was transposed to an area on the opposite side of Salt Valley that includes Landscape Arch, the longest arch in the park. Ringhoffer's original discovery was omitted, while another area nearby, known locally as the Windows, was included. Designation of the area as a national monument was supported by the Park Service in 1926 but was resisted by President Calvin Coolidge's Interior Secretary, Hubert Work. Finally, in April 1929, shortly after his inauguration, President Herbert Hoover signed a presidential proclamation creating the Arches National Monument, consisting of two comparatively small, disconnected sections. The purpose of the reservation under the 1906 Antiquities Act was to protect the arches, spires, balanced rocks, and other sandstone formations for their scientific and educational value. The name Arches was suggested by Frank Pinkely, superintendent of the Park Service's southwestern national monuments, following a visit to the Windows section in 1925.

In late 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a proclamation that enlarged the Arches to protect additional scenic features and permit the development of facilities to promote tourism. A small adjustment was made by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1960 to accommodate a new road alignment.

In early 1969, just before leaving office, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed a proclamation substantially enlarging the Arches. Two years later, President Richard Nixon signed legislation enacted by Congress, which significantly reduced the total area enclosed, but changed its status. Arches National Park was formally dedicated in May 1972.

In 1980, vandals attempted to use an abrasive kitchen cleanser to deface ancient petroglyphs in the park, prompting park officials to recruit physicist John F. Asmus, who specialized in using lasers to restore works of art, to use his technology to repair the damage. Asmus "zapped the panel with intense light pulses and succeeded in removing most of the cleanser". In 2016, there was another vandalism event on Frame Arch in the park, where a section if the rock was carved out. Due to advances in technology, in 2018 the arch was repaired through color match and modern infilling methods.

Answer:

First Humans appeared in this region during the last ice age 10000 years ago. The first settlers began in 1775 but were abandoned before 1855 when ranchers, farmers, and prospectors settled in Moab(the closest city to the Arches). The first attention to these beautiful rock formations was broad in 1923 by Frank A. Wadleigh. Devils Garden(known as Klondike Bluffs today) got its name from a prospector from Salt Valley Alexander Ringhoffer, Devils Garden was transposed to an area on the opposite side of Salt Valley. Landscape Arch is the longest arch in the park and the fifth longest in the world! 
In 1929, President Herbert Hoover signed a presidential proclamation creating the Arches National Monument to protect the arches, spires, balanced rocks, and other sandstone formations for their scientific and educational value. The name Arches was suggested by Frank Pinkely, in 1925. From 1938 multiple presidents of the United States of America signed multiple proclamations to protest scenic features and permits for road constructions in order to attract tourists into the area but only in 1972 Arches National Park was officially created. 
In 1980, vandals tried to destroy ancient petroglyphs in the park, which physicist John F. Asmus restored using laser technology for restoration. In 2016, another vandalism event happened on Frame Arch a section of rocks was carved, but thanks to technology, it was restored.

From the passage provided, extract the date when Lincoln was assasinated

Context:

During the American Civil War (1861–1865), Washington, D.C., the capital city of the United States, was the center of the Union war effort, which rapidly turned it from a small city into a major capital with full civic infrastructure and strong defenses.

The shock of the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861, with demoralized troops wandering the streets of the capital, caused President Abraham Lincoln to order extensive fortifications and a large garrison. That required an influx of troops, military suppliers and building contractors, which would set up a new demand for accommodation, including military hospitals. The abolition of slavery in Washington in 1862 also attracted many freedmen to the city. Except for one attempted invasion by Confederate cavalry leader Jubal Early in 1864, the capital remained impregnable.

When Lincoln was assassinated in Ford's Theater in April 1865, thousands flocked into Washington to view the coffin, further raising the profile of the city. The new president, Andrew Johnson, wanted to dispel the funereal atmosphere and organized a program of victory parades, which revived public hopes for the future.

Answer:

Lincoln was assassinated in Ford's Theater in April 1865

Who was Raghib Pasha?

Context:

Isma'il ibn Ahmad ibn Hassan bani Yani (Arabic: إسماعيل بن أحمد بن حسن بني يني), known simply as Isma'il Ragheb Pasha (Arabic: إسماعيل راغب باشا) (1819–1884), was a Greek Ottoman politician who served as a Prime Minister of Egypt and held several other high-ranking government positions.

Isma'il Ragheb was of Greek ancestry and was born in Greece on 18 August 1819 on either the island of Chios following the great massacre of Candia, Crete. After being kidnapped to Anatolia he was brought to Egypt as a slave by Ibrahim Pasha in 1830 and was converted to Islam. Immediately following his arrival, he studied at al-Maktab al-Amiri and obtained his advanced degree in 1834. He was fluent in Greek and was elevated to the rank of First Lieutenant by Egypt's viceroy Muhammad Ali Pasha. In 1836, he became head of the Accounting and Revenue Agencies. He was promoted to the rank of bikbashi (Lieutenant Colonel) in 1840, then kaymakam (Colonel) in 1844, and finally amiralay (Brigadier General) in 1846.[citation needed]

He held the positions of Minister of Finance (1858–1860), then Minister of War (1860–1861).[citation needed] He became Inspector for the Maritime Provinces in 1862, and later Assistant (Arabic: باشمعاون) to viceroy Isma'il Pasha (1863–1865). He was granted the title of beylerbey and then appointed President of the Privy council in 1868. He was appointed President of the Chamber of Deputies (1866–1867), then Minister of Interior in 1867, then Minister of Agriculture and Trade in 1875.[citation needed] He again held the Finance portfolio in Muhammad Sharif Pasha's first government (1879). After the fall of Mahmoud Sami el-Baroudi's government, Isma'il Ragheb became Prime Minister of Egypt in 1882.[citation needed] Although his government was short-lived (it lasted from 17 June to 21 August only), it was the only one to present concrete programs. His achievements include the modernisation of the budget through the inventory of revenues and expenses, the Law on Salaries, and the La'eha Sa'ideyya as well as several agricultural laws.[citation needed]

Isma'il Ragheb died in 1884.[citation needed]

Answer:

Raghib Pasha was a Greek Ottoman politician who served in various roles in Egypt during the mid to late 1800s, including Prime Minister of Egypt for a brief period.

<s> Instruction:

Astronomers are finding new planets every day. There could be potentially billions of planetary systems in the universe. Compare the these discovered planetary systems with our own Solar system.

Context:

Answer:

One major difference between our Solar System and distant planet systems appears to be the eccentricities of those planet’s orbits. Planets in our Solar System have more or less circular orbits (with eccentricities < 10% from a perfect circular orbit), while exoplanets have up to 50% eccentricities. Exoplanets with high eccentricties may not be stable over the long-term. Another difference is that the most common size of exoplanets is super earth (that is 2-3x size of earth) while our solar system does not have any super earths.

Why do gas prices go high in winter

Context:

Answer:

Prices in a market economy are driven by Supply and demand. Gas prices typically increase in a market economy in a winter because of increase in demand. Demand increases because people use gas to warm homes and cold weather further increases demand for gas. All this increase in demand means gas prices increase. It is not required that gas prices always increase.

how important is workflow integration in obtaining value from AI?

Context:

Answer:

While data and AI are the key to delivering a modern online customer experience, grand insights and precise predictions mean nothing if the business cannot act upon them. As we see more and more organizations, especially those engaged in online commerce, fold data-driven capabilities into their operational workflows, moving from insight to action often entails the deployment of real-time capabilities, capable of sensing and responding to opportunities in the moment.

Is it a good idea to have a protein shake after a gym workout? How do I make one?

Context:

Answer:

Most health professionals agree that consuming extra protein with strength training is helpful. Some experts recommend one gram of protein per pound of body weight over the entire day, though there are a variety of studies on the subject with differing recommendations. The recent consensus view is a post-workout recovery meal is a good idea, typically within 30 minutes to two hours of completing strength training. A mix of carbohydrates and protein is recommended. 

To make one for yourself:
1. Get a good protein source, typically a protein powder. Casein and Whey proteins are popular choices. 
2. Add the protein powder to a shaker. Some are small and handheld; other models use electricity. 
3. Following the instructions on the protein powder, add water or milk. Typically, 4 to 8 oz of liquid for one scoop (30g) of powder. 
4. Optionally add your favorite fruits, such as bananas or strawberries.
5. Shake things together for around a minute. 

Enjoy, but be sure to vary your protein sources as a part of a healthy and balanced diet!

From the passage note down the name and population of largest and smallest US state categorized by population. List the results in format ‘name of state: Population count‘.

Context:

The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C., the capital city of the United States), five major territories, and various minor islands. Both the states and the United States as a whole are each sovereign jurisdictions. The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution allows states to exercise all powers of government not delegated to the federal government. Each state has its own constitution and government, and all states and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is represented by two senators, while representatives are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census. Additionally, each state is entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elects the president of the United States, equal to the total of representatives and senators in Congress from that state. The federal district does not have representatives in the Senate, but has a non-voting delegate in the House, and it is also entitled to electors in the Electoral College. Congress can admit more states, but it cannot create a new state from territory of an existing state or merge of two or more states into one without the consent of all states involved, and each new state is admitted on an equal footing with the existing states.

The United States has control over fourteen territories. Five of them (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) have a permanent, nonmilitary population, while nine of them (the United States Minor Outlying Islands) do not. With the exception of Navassa Island, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which are located in the Caribbean, all territories are located in the Pacific Ocean. One territory, Palmyra Atoll, is considered to be incorporated, meaning the full body of the Constitution has been applied to it; the other territories are unincorporated, meaning the Constitution does not fully apply to them. Ten territories (the Minor Outlying Islands and American Samoa) are considered to be unorganized, meaning they have not had an organic act enacted by Congress; the four other territories are organized, meaning an organic act has been enacted by Congress. The five inhabited territories each have limited autonomy in addition to having territorial legislatures and governors, but residents cannot vote in federal elections, although all are represented by non-voting delegates in the House.

The largest state by population is California, with a population of 39,538,223 people, while the smallest is Wyoming, with a population of 576,851 people; the federal district has a larger population (689,545) than both Wyoming and Vermont. The largest state by area is Alaska, encompassing 665,384 square miles (1,723,337 square kilometers), while the smallest is Rhode Island, encompassing 1,545 square miles (4,001 square kilometers). The most recent states to be admitted, Alaska and Hawaii, were admitted in 1959. The largest territory by population is Puerto Rico, with a population of 3,285,874 people (larger than 21 states), while the smallest is the Northern Mariana Islands, with a population of 47,329 people. Puerto Rico is the largest territory by area, encompassing 5,325 square miles (13,791 square kilometers); the smallest territory, Kingman Reef, encompasses only 0.005 square miles (0.01 square kilometers).

Answer:

Largest state by population - California: 39,538,223
Smallest state by population - Wyoming: 576,851
