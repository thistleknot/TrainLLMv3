TITLE: TIFU by judging somebody by face value.
POST: Before you read, this is a pretty shitty and boring story.   

I had to hand back some take home assessments for my Security license today. When I went to the training center there was a group doing a first aid course. As I was approaching the front door, (the front door goes to a little foyer) a first aid class was using this foyer to do their CPR on the training dummies. So of course as soon as I was inside, I was smack bang in the middle of their session. Anyway, as I was saying, Im approaching the door and a man in a suit and tie sees me coming, smiles and puts his hands on his hips and waits for me to get in the door. I interpreted this as a welcoming. His body language said "Hey, how can I help". So I walk in and say "Hi, are you from the training group?" He says No and points to the guy who is. I saw a suit and tie in a room full of t shirts and shorts and instantly thought he was in charge. I judged a book by its cover.

Epicurus further adopted the view that minima cannot be free-standing but, like points in lines, necessarily exist only in aggregates. Consequently, Epicurus distinguished between the atom, which was physically unsplittable as a consequence of its material solidity, and the minimum or theoretically indivisible quantity (Letter to Herodotus 58-59). Because the minimum, however small, is finite, it can, unlike a point, serve as a unit of measure of magnitudes. Epicurus agreed with Democritus, as against Plato and Aristotle, that the universe extends infinitely, and consequently the number of atoms and of local worlds is held to be infinite (Letter to Herodotus 45). The number of kinds of atoms, however, is described as incomprehensible but not strictly infinite (there is, accordingly, an infinite number of

Where are debarked logs fed into during the TMP process?

Context:

There are two major mechanical pulps, the thermomechanical one (TMP) and groundwood pulp (GW). In the TMP process, wood is chipped and then fed into large steam heated refiners, where the chips are squeezed and converted to fibres between two steel discs. In the groundwood process, debarked logs are fed into grinders where they are pressed against rotating stones to be made into fibres. Mechanical pulping does not remove the lignin, so the yield is very high, >95%, however it causes the paper thus produced to turn yellow and become brittle over time. Mechanical pulps have rather short fibres, thus producing weak paper. Although large amounts of electrical energy are required to produce mechanical pulp, it costs less than the chemical kind.

POST: So me and my boyfriend (Mike) have been going out for about 2 years now. We've had a few troubles one of these being his former friend (Caitlin). She crossed the line a few times and the friendship was ended (I'd like to add that this was a year ago and was my boyfriends decision, she upset me a few times and yeah you get the picture). 

So we're currently at different Universitys and living in diferent towns but met up on Saturday to hang out with some of our friends from our hometown. Late in the evening one of my friend shows me messages sent from Caitlin and it's basically stuff that Mike has said about me. It's pretty personal stuff, but also hurtful. It talks about how I'm never there for him when he needs me, lack of sex since we've gone to different places and well stuff like that. I was upset but I'm not an unreasonable person and the stuff he had told her was all said while they were close friends. I've talked about similar things with a close friend of mine.

Now it's been a few days and we haven't seen each other since but have texted and phoned. I'm not mad at him because he's done nothing wrong but I'm feeling very paranoid now, I'm scared of what I say and do because I feel like it's what he complained about to Caitlin. I'm being incredibly stupid but it's just stuck in my head and constantly playing on repeat.

Aristotle’s examination of candidates for substance leads to the view that, in the case of perceptible things, primary substance is neither the material substratum nor anything that is universal with respect to the subjects of which it is logically predicable, but rather is a definable form or essence that requires matter for its existence. He agrees with the Platonists that a substance is a logical subject, but argues against their view that it is the genus, being the logical subject for the differentia, that is substance. Their synoptic general science of being takes the highest universals to be the most substantial. By way of sharp contrast, Aristotle himself thinks that the Platonist’s treatment of each item predicable in common of particulars as separate and “some this” leads to an infinite regress that he refers to as the “third man.” The reasoning behind it involves something like this: If the

There are four different types of cause or explanatory factor. The material cause is that out of which a thing is generated and which persists as a constituent (e.g., the bronze is the material cause of the statue).

Dried fruit has a long tradition of use dating back to the fourth millennium BC in Mesopotamia, and is prized because of its sweet taste, nutritive value and long shelf life.
Today, dried fruit consumption is widespread. Nearly half of the dried fruits sold are raisins, followed by dates, prunes, figs, apricots, peaches, apples, and pears. These are referred to as "conventional" or "traditional" dried fruits: fruits that have been dried in the sun or in heated wind tunnel dryers. Many fruits such as cranberries, blueberries, cherries, strawberries, and mango are infused with a sweetener (e.g. sucrose syrup) prior to drying. Some products sold as dried fruit, like papaya, kiwifruit and pineapple, are most often candied fruit.
Dried fruits retain most of the nutritional value of fresh fruits. The specific nutrient content of the different dried fruits reflects their fresh counterpart and the processing method.

What kingdom under the Spartocid dynasty consisted of Maeotians, Thracians, Crimean Scythians and Cimmerians?

Context:

Before the Hellenistic period, Greek colonies had been established on the coast of the Crimean and Taman peninsulas. The Bosporan Kingdom was a multi-ethnic kingdom of Greek city states and local tribal peoples such as the Maeotians, Thracians, Crimean Scythians and Cimmerians under the Spartocid dynasty (438–110 BCE). The Spartocids were a hellenized Thracian family from Panticapaeum. The Bosporans had long lasting trade contacts with the Scythian peoples of the Pontic-Caspian steppe, and Hellenistic influence can be seen in the Scythian settlements of the Crimea, such as in the Scythian Neapolis. Scythian pressure on the Bosporan kingdom under Paerisades V led to its eventual vassalage under the Pontic king Mithradates VI for protection, circa 107 BCE. It later became a Roman client state. Other Scythians on the steppes of Central Asia came into contact with Hellenistic culture through the Greeks of Bactria. Many Scythian elites purchased Greek products and some Scythian art shows Greek influences. At least some Scythians seem to have become Hellenized, because we know of conflicts between the elites of the Scythian kingdom over the adoption of Greek ways. These Hellenized Scythians were known as the "young Scythians". The peoples around Pontic Olbia, known as the Callipidae, were intermixed and Hellenized Greco-Scythians.
