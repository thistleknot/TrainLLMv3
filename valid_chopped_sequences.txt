From the passage provided, extract the date when Lincoln was assasinated

Context:

During the American Civil War (1861–1865), Washington, D.C., the capital city of the United States, was the center of the Union war effort, which rapidly turned it from a small city into a major capital with full civic infrastructure and strong defenses.

The shock of the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861, with demoralized troops wandering the streets of the capital, caused President Abraham Lincoln to order extensive fortifications and a large garrison. That required an influx of troops, military suppliers and building contractors, which would set up a new demand for accommodation, including military hospitals. The abolition of slavery in Washington in 1862 also attracted many freedmen to the city. Except for one attempted invasion by Confederate cavalry leader Jubal Early in 1864, the capital remained impregnable.

When Lincoln was assassinated in Ford's Theater in April 1865, thousands flocked into Washington to view the coffin, further raising the profile of the city. The new president, Andrew Johnson, wanted to dispel the funereal atmosphere and organized a program of victory parades, which revived public hopes for the future.

Answer:

Lincoln was assassinated in Ford's Theater in April 1865

Answer:

The Netherlands, Germany, Finland, Italy and Luxembourg are in the European Union.

Rest of the countries: Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Australia, Vietnam and Canada are not a part of the European Union but might have deals allowing them to benefit from the certain conveniences of the European Union such as free trade.

For example, while Switzerland has very close ties with European Union nations and has similar benefits, they are not a part of the EU. Switzerland enjoys benefits such as freedom of movement of people between the EU member states and Switzerland, this is due to a separate agreement: Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons (AFMP).

Without quoting directly from the text give me a summary of how turist visit the falls even if they are used for hydroelectric power production.

Context:

The Cascata delle Marmore (Italian: [kaˈskaːta delle ˈmarmore]) or Marmore Falls is a man-made waterfall created by the ancient Romans. Its total height is 165 m (541 feet), making it the tallest man-made waterfall in the world.

It is located 7.7 km from Terni, a provincial capital of the Italian region of Umbria. 

Its source is a portion of the waters of the river Velino. After flowing through Piediluco lake near the community of Marmore (italian), it pours into the valley below formed by the river Nera. The flow of the waterfall depends on an off and on scale with a published schedule to support the power company nearby.

Most of the time, the water in the canals above the Cascata delle Marmore falls is diverted to a hydroelectric power plant, so the flow in the falls themselves is heavily reduced. Piediluco Lake, above the falls, is used as a reservoir for the power plant. The Galleto power plant, built in 1929, is architecturally interesting. Its capacity is about 530 MW. To control the operation of the power plant, and to satisfy tourists, the falls are turned on according to a set schedule, achieving a spectacular effect at full flow. An alarm is sounded first, then the gates are opened, and in a few minutes the small stream is transformed into a full-sized river rushing into the void below.

Normally, the falls are turned on between 12:00 and 13:00 and again between 16:00 and 17:00 every day, with additional times on holidays. An entrance fee is charged to visit the falls and the surrounding area.

A path along the falls allows the visitor to hike up to the top of the falls. Along the way, a tunnel leads to an observatory just next to the falls, where a visitor is likely to get soaked. Another observatory near the top affords a wide view of the falls and of the Nera valley below.

Answer:

The Marmore Falls are used as a hydroelectric power plant, but to allow people to enjoy the spectacular water flow, the gates are periodically opened to present the full-sized river rushing into the void. 

The tourists can visit the falls on a fixed schedule (12:00 to 13:00, 16:00 to 17:00 plus additional times on holidays) following paths that allow them to reach the top of the falls.

What is the difference between a coastal cruising and blue water sailboat?

Context:

Answer:

The designs, accommodations and compromises for these boats can be very different and reflect the likely sea conditions these boats would encounter, expected time at sea and different experiences of passenger comfort.  The primary difference between these boats begins with the shape of the hull since many other design choices tend to be dictated by hull shape.

Coastal cruisers, which are generally sailed near shore and in safer weather conditions, 
tend to have a flatter hull shapes since these boats, which means they tend to "slap" the water when coming off a wave.  With a flatter hull shape, boat architects can make greater use of the cabin space and so coastal cruisers will generally have a more spacious interior.  The helm (or the outdoor area from which the boat is navigated) is generally less protected and generally speaking, offers greater comfort and ease of moving around.  Safety, protection and expected time away from marinas mean these boats can refill fresh water, recharge batteries, empty waste tanks more frequently and therefore, tend to have lower capacities.

Blue water boats, because they are intended to sail in open waters (hence the moniker "blue water") in more unpredictable weather, generally have tapered (or tear drop shaped) hull shapes with heavier keels (generally, lead) and deeper drafts.  With these designs, blue water boats can withstand heavier seas and will "cut through" waves rather than "slap."  Generally speaking, blue water boats offer a much more comfortable experience in rougher seas and will have bigger fresh water and fuel tanks and will likely feature generators and other equipment that allows these boats to away for longer periods.

Blue water boats feature tapered hulls so the beam or width of the boat narrows the closer it gets to the water line (and below), leaving less room in the interior cabin than an equally sized coastal cruiser.  Foot for foot, blue water boats will feature fewer berths and will have more cramped quarters because of the narrowing beam.

Because blue water boats are intended to sail longer distances and will carry more fuel and fresh water, these boats interior space is further restricted to accomadate these practical requirements.

The differences in comfort, stability and likelihood of capsizing are all captured in mathematical calculations that can provide an abstracted comparison between these boat types so prospective buyers can anticipate the the experiences and trade offs each hull type would provide.

Tell me three ways to get coconut from a coconut tree

Context:

Answer:

Here are the three ways to get coconut from a coconut tree
1) Using a pole and saw:
Attach a curved saw to end of a very long stick. Make sure the saw does not fall when you pull on the coconut.Stand away from the bottom of the tree at a safe distance and hook the saw on to the stem of the coconut and pull down. 

2) Using foot strap to climb:
Make a foot strap out of a cloth or a rope and climb on the coconut tree by gripping the tree with your hand and the knot on your legs. Make sure the loop around your feet is stretched tight against the tree. Once you reach the top of the tree, you can cut a coconut with a knife that you carried on your belt

3) Using a ladder to climb:
This method is useful for shorter coconut trees. Keep the ladder slanting against the coconut tree on a stable ground. Make sure the ladder is stable while you climb. Climb up the ladder and once you can reach the coconut, cut it out with a knife.

Create a comma separated list of all countries mentioned in this paragraph on the history of test cricket

Context:

Test cricket is a form of first-class cricket played at international level between teams representing full member countries of the International Cricket Council (ICC). A match consists of four innings (two per team) and is scheduled to last for up to five days. In the past, some Test matches had no time limit and were called Timeless Tests. The term "test match" was originally coined in 1861–62 but in a different context.

Test cricket did not become an officially recognised format until the 1890s, but many international matches since 1877 have been retrospectively awarded Test status. The first such match took place at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in March 1877 between teams which were then known as a Combined Australian XI and James Lillywhite's XI, the latter a team of visiting English professionals. Matches between Australia and England were first called "test matches" in 1892. The first definitive list of retrospective Tests was written by South Australian journalist Clarence P. Moody two years later and, by the end of the century, had gained acceptance.

There are now twelve full ICC member countries playing Test cricket. Day/night Tests were permitted by the ICC in 2012 and the first day/night match was between Australia and New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval in November 2015.

Answer:

Australia, England, New Zealand

How to be rich?

Context:

Answer:

While many people aspire to become rich, the reality is that it's an elusive dream for most of all, as less than 1% of the population ever achieve true wealth. It's important to acknowledge that not everyone can become rich, and that financial success is not the only measure of a fulfilling life. However, having a job that can sustain your daily life and your family is a good starting point. From there, you can think about ways to promote yourself and increase your income. It's also important to remember that richness is not just about money; emotional wealth, such as living a happy and fulfilling life and having no regrets, is also a form of richness.

Explain to me why people decide to go vegan.

Context:

Answer:

Vegans are primarily concerned with animal welfare. Humans do not need to eat animal products to be healthy, so using animals for food is unnecessary. Under capitalism, trillions of animals are raised in horrible conditions each year to be slaughtered to satisfy human taste buds. However, even if an animal is raised in conditions better than a factory farm, killing them is purely for taste since humans do not need to eat them to survive. Vegans view this as immoral and choose to not use animal products. 

Additionally, meat has a high carbon footprint compared to eating plants. Beef is a particularly bad offender. Vast swathes of the rainforest are cleared away to make room to raise cows for slaughter. Many vegans also care about the environment and avoiding animal products is a way to contribute less damage to the environment.
